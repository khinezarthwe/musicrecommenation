Well I was only a kid, didn't know enough to be afraid.Playing the game, but not the way the big boys playedNothing to lose, maybe I had something to tradeThe way the big wheel spinsWell I was only a kid on a holy crusadeI placed no trust in a faith that was ready madeTake no chances on paradise delayedSo I do a slow fadePlaying for timeDon't want to wait for heavenLooking for loveFor an angel to forgive my sinsPlaying with fireChasing something new to believe inLooking for love.The way the big wheel spins.The way the big wheel spinsWell I was only a kid, cruising around in a trancePrisoner of fate, victim of circumstanceI was lined up for glory, but the tickets sold out in advanceThe way the big wheel spinsWell I was only a kid, gone without a backward glanceGoing for broke, going for another chanceHoping for heaven, hoping for a fine romanceIf I do the right dancePlaying for timeDon't want to wait for heavenLooking for loveFor an angel to forgive my sinsPlaying with fireChasing something new to believe inLooking for loveThe way the big wheel spinsThe way the big wheel spinsWheel goes round, landing on a twist of faithTaking your chances you'll have the right answersWhen the final judgement beginsWheel goes round, landing on a leap of fateLife redirected in ways unexpectedSometimes the odd number winsThe way the big wheel spinsPlaying for timeDon't want to wait for heavenLooking for loveFor an angel to forgive my sinsPlaying with fireChasing something new to believe inLooking for loveThe way the big wheel spinsPlaying for timeDon't want to wait for heavenLooking for loveThe way the big wheel spinsThe way the big wheel spinsThe way the big wheel spinsThe way the big wheel spinsThe way the big wheel spins
