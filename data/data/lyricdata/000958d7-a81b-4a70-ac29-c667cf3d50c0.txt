She smiled in a big way, the way a girl like that smiles When the world is hers and she held your eyes Out in the breezeway Down by the shore in the lazy summer And she pulled you in And she bit your lip and she made you hers She looked deep into you as you lay together Quiet in the grasp of dusk and summer But you've already lost But you've already lost But you've already lost When you only had barely enough to hang on And she combed your hair and she kissed your teeth And she made you better than you'd been before She told you bad things You wished you could change in the lazy summer And she told you, laughing down to her core So she would not cry as she lay in your lap She said Nobody here can live forever Quiet in the grasp of dusk and summer But you've already lost But you've already lost But you've already lost When you only had barely enough to hang on She said, " No one is alone the way you are alone" And you held her looser than you would have If you ever could have known Some things tie your life together, slender threads And things to treasure days like that should last and last and last But you've already lost But you've already lost But you've already lost When you only had barely enough of her To hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on
