She smiled in a big way, the way a girl like that smilesWhen the world is hers and she held your eyesOut in the breezewayDown by the shore in the lazy summerAnd she pulled you inAnd she bit your lip and she made you hersShe looked deep into you as you lay togetherQuiet in the grasp of dusk and summerBut you've already lostBut you've already lostBut you've already lostWhen you only had barely enough to hang onAnd she combed your hair and she kissed your teethAnd she made you better than you'd been beforeShe told you bad thingsYou wished you could change in the lazy summerAnd she told you, laughing down to her coreSo she would not cry as she lay in your lapShe said, "Nobody here can live foreverQuiet in the grasp of dusk and summer"But you've already lostBut you've already lostBut you've already lostWhen you only had barely enough to hang onShe said, "No one is alone the way you are alone"And you held her looser than you would haveIf you ever could have knownSome things tie your life together, slender threadsAnd things to treasure days like that should last and last and lastBut you've already lostBut you've already lostBut you've already lostWhen you only had barely enough of herTo hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on
