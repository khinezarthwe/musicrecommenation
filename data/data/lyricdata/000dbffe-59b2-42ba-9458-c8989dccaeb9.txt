My little lightIs going to shineShine out so brightAnd illuminate your mindMy little soulWill leave a footprintThis little voiceIs going to singI have no choiceIt will infinitely ringMy little soulWill leave a footprintI'm channeling the universeIt's focusing itself inside of meA singularityMy little wordsAre going to stingHaven't you heardThe pain and joy they bringMy little soulWill leave a footprintI'm channeling the universeIt's focusing itself inside of meA singularityYour little eyesThey're going to seeI can't disguiseThe beauty inside meMy little soulWill leave a footprint
