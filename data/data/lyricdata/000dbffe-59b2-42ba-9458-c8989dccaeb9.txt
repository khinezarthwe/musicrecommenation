My little lightIs going to shineShine out so bright.And illuminate your mindMy little soulWill leave a footprint.This little voiceIs going to sing.I have no choiceIt will infinitely ringMy little soulWill leave a footprintI'm channeling the universeIt's focusing itself inside of me.A singularity.My little wordsAre going to stingHaven't you heardThe pain and joy they bringMy little soulWill leave a footprint.I'm channeling the universeIt's focusing itself inside of me.A singularity.Your little eyes.They're going to seeI can't disguise.The beauty inside meMy little soulWill leave a footprint
