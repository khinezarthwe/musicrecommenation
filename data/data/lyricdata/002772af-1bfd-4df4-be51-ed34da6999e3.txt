Let's spend the night togetherI know you want it tooThe magic of the momentIs what I've got for youThe heartbeat of this nightIs made to lose controlAnd there is something in your eyesThat's longing for some moreLet us find togetherThe beat we're looking forThe rhythm of loveKeeps me dancing on the roadThe rhythm of loveGot the groove that hits the boneThe rhythm of loveIs the game I'm looking forThe rhythm of loveIs the heartbeat of my soulLet's reach the top togetherOne night will never doAn exploding shot of pleasureIs what I've got for youWhy don't you close your eyesAnd let your feeling growI make you feel the taste of lifeUntil your love will flowLet us find togetherThe beat we're longing forThe rhythm of loveKeeps me dancing on the roadThe rhythm of loveGot the groove that hits the boneThe rhythm of loveIs the game I'm looking forThe rhythm of loveIs the heartbeat of my soulLet us find togetherThe beat we're looking for
