The black house in in my streetlooks too dark just to go insideBut when I doI cannot move because ofthe mess in the hallwayThe picture on the wall is chaoticI don't want to look at itBut when I doI cannot speak because ofthe confusion in my headI am unfit and I want to leap awayBut when I doThe red colour comes after meIt is fierce and it moves slowThe picture on the wall is chaoticI don't want to look at itBut when I doI cannot speak because ofthe confusion in my headI am unfit and I want to leap awayBut when I doThe red colour comes after meIt is fierce and it moves slow
