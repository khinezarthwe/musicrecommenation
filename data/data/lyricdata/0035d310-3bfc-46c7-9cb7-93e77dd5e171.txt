Over the sea and far awayShe's waiting like an icebergWaiting to changeBut she's cold insideShe wants to be like the waterAll the muscles tighten in her faceBuries her soul in one embraceThey're one and the sameJust like waterThen the fire fades awayAnd most of everydayIs full of tired excusesBut it's too hard to sayI wish it were simpleBut we give up easilyYou're close enough to see thatYou're the other side of the world to meOn comes the panic lightHolding on with fingersAnd feelings alikeBut the time has comeTo move alongThen the fire fades awayAnd most of everydayIs full of tired excusesBut it's too hard to sayI wish it were simpleBut we give up easilyYou're close enough to see thatYou're the other side of the worldCan you help me?Can you let me go?And can you still love meWhen you can't see me anymore?Then the fire fades awayAnd most of everydayIs full of tired excusesBut it's too hard to sayI wish it were simpleBut we give up easilyYou're close enough to see thatYou're the other side of the worldYou're the other side of the worldYou're the other side of the world to me
