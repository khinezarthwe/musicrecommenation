This time of night I could call you upI'd get angry with athletic ease, break common laws in twos and threesIf I die clutching your photographDon't call me boring, it's just 'cause I like youOh take me on back, take me on back, you take me backTo the place where I could feel your heartIs this the end or just the start ofSomething really, really beautiful?Wrapped up and disguised as something really, really uglyWon't you...Come by and see me, I'm a love letter awayI'd break your name before I'd say:No, I don't care if you saw, I watched every inch of filmFlash across your Roman featuresAnd I loved it, loved it, no I don't care ifYou think I'm eager to shut your eyes, wellI'm sorry - everybody knows, you can't break me with your gutter proseWould you believe it? She sent me a letterThe ring, it nearly weighs her down, she's got another boy, oh boySteady your ears, steady your ears and read my lipsPoetry is not a luxury, it's how I'll break this homeAnd when I'm really ill, won't you cradle me?Man is not a noble animal, but maybe woman is, rememberI heard you...Inside your room, you said:Oh did you really mean it? No, I never break my gazeIf just to see this scar remain reflected in your eyesI think it's time to go homeOh, tell me your thoughts, tell me your thoughts on libertySee, there's a place where I sink to sleepingShe saidWill you join me for another round?I haven't had the chance to speak yetGod speed...I break the law once every week to feel your touchWhat's a book to you in bed? Do you feel better, older?Say:Still you're not around to curseI've gotta drop the gun now, say I'm still under youMarianne, let the ghosts sleep tonightMarianne, let the ghosts sleep, just shut your eyes and burn the pastMarianne, let the ghosts sleep tonightMarianne, let the ghosts sleep, just shut your eyes and burn the pastMarianne, let the ghosts sleep tonightMarianne, let the ghosts sleep, just shut your eyes and burn the pastMarianne, let the ghosts sleep tonightMarianne, let the ghosts sleep, just shut your eyes and burn the past away
