Meeting youWith a view to a killFace to face in secret placesFeel the chillNightfall covers meBut you know the plans I'm makingStill overseaCould it be the whole Earth opening wide?A sacred whyA mystery gaping insideThe weekend's whyUntil we dance into the fireThat fatal kiss is all we needDance into the fireTo fatal sound of broken dreamsDance into the fireThat fatal kiss is all we needDance into the fireChoice for youIs a view to a killBetween the shadesAssassination standing stillFirst crystal tearsFall as snowflakes on your bodyFirst time in yearsTo drench your skin with lover's rosy stainA chance to find the phoenix for the flameA chance to dieAgain we dance into the fireThat fatal kiss is all we needDance into the fireTo fatal sound of broken dreamsDance into the fireThat fatal kiss is all we needDance into the fireWhen all we see is the view to a kill
