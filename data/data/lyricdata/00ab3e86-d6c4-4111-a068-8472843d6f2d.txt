I'm not sure what I'm looking for anymoreI just know that I'm harder to consoleI don't see who I'm trying to be instead of meBut the key is a question of controlCan you say what you're trying to play anywayI just pay while you're breaking all the rulesAll the signs that I find have been underlinedDevils thrive on the drive that is fueledAll this running around, well, it's getting me downJust give me a pain that I'm used toI don't need to believe all the dreams you conceiveYou just need to achieve something that rings trueThere's a hole in your soul like an animalWith no conscience, repentance unknownClose your eyes, pay the price for your paradiseDevils feed on the seeds that are sownI can't conceal what I feel, what I know is realNo mistaking the faking, I careWith a prayer in the air I will leave it thereOn a note full of hope not despairAll this running around, well, it's getting me downJust give me a pain that I'm used toI don't need to believe all the dreams you conceiveYou just need to achieve something that rings true
