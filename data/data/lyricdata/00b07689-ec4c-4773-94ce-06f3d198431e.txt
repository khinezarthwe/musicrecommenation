I am leaving this harbourGiving urban a farewellIts habitants seem too keen on GodI cannot stomach their rights and wrongsI have lost my originAnd I don't want to find it againWhether sailing into nature's lawsAnd be held by ocean's pawsWanderlust! relentlessly cravingWanderlust! peel off the layersUntil we get to the coreDid I imagine it would be like this?Was it something like this I wished for?Or will I want more?Lust for comfortSuffocates the soulRelentless restlessnessLiberates me (sets me free)I feel at homeWhenever the unknown surrounds meI receive its embraceAboard my floating houseWanderlust! relentlessly cravingWanderlust! peel off the layersUntil we get to the coreDid I imagine it would be like this?Was it something like this I wished for?Or will I want more?Wanderlust! from island to islandWanderlust! united in movementWonderful! I'm joined with youWanderlust!Can you spot a pattern?(relentlessly restless)
