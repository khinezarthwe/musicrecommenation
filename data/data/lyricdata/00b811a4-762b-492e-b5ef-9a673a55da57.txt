( Verse) You used to wake me with a smile on your faceeach morning lieing next to you. Now we don't talk cause you have nothing to sayso sad Wish I could help see you through. Well...( Chorus) Wish time could stand still so you don't feel left behind (left behind) You never thought you'd findyards of brokentorn apart I know they're be times of rain those are the days that I want to give in I'll be your friend through the cloudy days Don't be ashamed I won't let you give in.( Verse) Sometimes I wish you could say all the things you want me to be But every day that that you cry Is a day that goes by And you're slipping away from me (yeah)( Chorus) Wish time could stand still so you don't feel left behind (left behind). You never thought you'd find you're so brokentorn apart. I know they're be times of rain those are the days that I want to give in. I'll be your friend through the cloudy days Don't be ashamed I won't let you give in.( Verse) Hey love I've been meaning to call you. It seem the stress of life put cracks in your armor, But you do it because it has to be done Although the faster you run your destination gets farther. I wish i take away you problems with a drop Of a dime and say its all good but its not. Your dreams get undermined accounts get overdrawn No matter the case girl I'm waiting with open arms.(?????) I know they're be times of rain those are the days that i want to give in I'll be your friend through the cloudy days Don't be ashamed I wont let you give in. (x2)
