(Verse)You used to wake me with a smile on your faceeach morning lieing next to you.Now we don't talk cause you have nothing to sayso sadWish I could help see you through. Well...(Chorus)Wish time could stand still so you don't feel left behind (left behind)You never thought you'd findyards of brokentorn apartI know they're be times of rain those are the days that I want to give inI'll be your friend through the cloudy daysDon't be ashamed I won't let you give in.(Verse)Sometimes I wish you could say all the things you want me to beBut every day that that you cryIs a day that goes byAnd you're slipping away from me (yeah)(Chorus)Wish time could stand still so you don't feel left behind (left behind).You never thought you'd find you're so brokentorn apart.I know they're be times of rain those are the days that I want to give in.I'll be your friend through the cloudy daysDon't be ashamed I won't let you give in.(Verse)Hey love I've been meaning to call you.It seem the stress of life put cracks in your armor,But you do it because it has to be doneAlthough the faster you run your destination gets farther.I wish i take away you problems with a dropOf a dime and say its all good but its not.Your dreams get undermined accounts get overdrawnNo matter the case girl I'm waiting with open arms.(?????)I know they're be times of rain those are the days that i want to give inI'll be your friend through the cloudy daysDon't be ashamedI wont let you give in.
