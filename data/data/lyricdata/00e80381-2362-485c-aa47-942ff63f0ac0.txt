These mist covered mountainsAre a home now for meBut my home is the lowlandsAnd always will beSome day you'll return toYour valleys and your farmsAnd you'll no longer burnTo be brothers in armsThrough these fields of destructionBaptisms of fireI've witnessed your sufferingAs the battle raged higherAnd though they did hurt me so badIn the fear and alarmYou did not desert meMy brothers in armsThere's so many different worldsSo many different sunsAnd we have just one worldBut we live in different onesNow the sun's gone to hellAnd the moon's riding highLet me bid you farewellEvery man has to dieBut it's written in the starlightAnd every line in your palmWe're fools to make warOn our brothers in arms
