Met a dancerWho was high in a fieldFrom her movementCaught my breath on my way homeCouldn't stop that spinning forceI felt in meEverything around seemed to giggle gleeShe walked up with a flower and I caredSo the dancerWho gets wild to the beats of record rhythmsBut I'm always away for weeksThat pass slow myMind gets lostFeeling envy for the kid who'll dance despite anythingI walk out in the flowers and feel betterIf I could just leave my body for the night:Then we could be dancingNo more missing you while I'm goneThere we could be dancingAnd you'd smile and say, "I like this song"And when our eyes will meet thereWe will recognize nothing's wrongAnd I wouldn't feel so selfishI won't be this way very longTo hold you in timeTo hold you in timeTo hold you in timeTo hold you in timeWhile we were dancingEarly hoursDrunken days finally endedAnd the streets turned for a pillowcaseThen I fumbled our good lockThen the ecstasy turns to rising lightThrough our windowpaneNow I'm goneI left flowers for you there
