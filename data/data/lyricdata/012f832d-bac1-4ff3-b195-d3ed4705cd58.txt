He used to be a singer in a rock and roll band. He would write the songs and I'd tremble at his hand. But oh, la la He lost poetic ethic and his songs were pathetic And he's a failure now. And he used to be the life and soul of everyone around, You'd never catch him looking up and never see him down But oh, la la He couldn't raise a smile, no not for a while And he's a failure now Don't cry child You've got so much more to live for. Don't cry child You've got something I would die for. And if it comes to the rain just be glad you'll smile again, Because so many don't and so many go unnamed. People push right past me shouting their exclaims A preacher pushes me aside and asked to wash my sins I said no, la la If he made me in his image, Then he's a failure too. And I used to need a couple of people keep my head down, Now I need a whole lot more to keep me on the ground. But oh, la la I gave up something and I gave it up for nothing And I am a failure now. Don't cry child You've got so much more to live for. Don't cry child You've got something I would die for. And if it comes to the rain just be glad you'll smile again, Because so many don't and so many go unnamed.
