He used to be a singer in a rock and roll band.He would write the songs and I'd tremble at his hand.But oh, la laHe lost poetic ethic and his songs were patheticAnd he's a failure now.And he used to be the life and soul of everyone around,You'd never catch him looking up and never see him downBut oh, la laHe couldn't raise a smile, no not for a whileAnd he's a failure nowDon't cry childYou've got so much more to live for.Don't cry childYou've got something I would die for.And if it comes to the rain just be glad you'll smile again,Because so many don't and so many go unnamed.People push right past me shouting their exclaimsA preacher pushes me aside and asked to wash my sinsI said no, la laIf he made me in his image,Then he's a failure too.And I used to need a couple of people keep my head down,Now I need a whole lot more to keep me on the ground.But oh, la laI gave up something and I gave it up for nothingAnd I am a failure now.Don't cry childYou've got so much more to live for.Don't cry childYou've got something I would die for.And if it comes to the rain just be glad you'll smile again,Because so many don't and so many go unnamed.
