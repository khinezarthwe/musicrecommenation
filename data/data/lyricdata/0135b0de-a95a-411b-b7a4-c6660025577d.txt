Nice and high and far awayJust like they saidI built this place with broken partsJust like they saidYou chip away the old version of youYou'd be surprised at what you can doI'm safe in here, irrelevantJust like they saidMy voice just echoes off these wallsYou feel me breathe, I am watching youI see it allThe many ways you can't get to meI see 'em allI see the hell you put yourself throughAll the things I could do if I wanted toMy voice just echoes off these wallsI don't need anything at allMy voice just echoes off these wallsAnd I just slowly fade awayAnd I just slowly fade awayAnd I just slowly fade awayFadeFadeFadeFadeYou will never ever, ever, ever get to me in hereYou will never ever, ever, ever get to me in hereYou will never ever, ever, ever get to me in hereYou will never ever, ever, ever get to me
