Well, it's a big, big city and it's always the same Can never be too pretty, tell me your name Is it out of line If I was to be bold and say, " Would you be mine?" Because I may be a beggar and you may be the queen I know I may be on a downer, I'm still ready to dream Though it's three o'clock The time is just the time it takes for you to talk So if you're lonely Why'd you say you're not lonely? Oh, you're a silly girl, I know, I heard it's so It's just like you to come and go And know me No, you don't even know me You're so sweet to try Oh my, you caught my eye A girl like you's just irresistible Well, it's a big, big city and the lights are all out But it's much as I can do, you know, to figure you out And I must confess My heart's in broken pieces and my head's a mess And it's four in the morning and I'm walking along Beside the ghost of every drinker here who's ever done wrong And it's you, woo-hoo That's got me going crazy for the things you do So if you're crazy I don't care, you amaze me But you're a stupid girl, oh me, oh my You talk, I die, you smile, you laugh, I cry And only A girl like you could be lonely And it's a crying shame if you would think the same A boy like me's just irresistible So if you're lonely Why'd you say you're not lonely? Oh, you're a silly girl, I know, I heard it's so It's just like you to come and go And know me No, you don't even know me You're so sweet to try, oh my, you caught my eye A girl like you's just irresistible
