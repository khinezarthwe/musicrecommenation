As I stand at the crossroadI see the sun sinking lowWith my cross of indecisionI can't tell which way to goNow I have seen the seven wondersAnd I have sailed the seven seasI've walked and talked with angelsAnd danced all night with gypsy queensAll in all it's been a rocky roadTwists and turns along the wayBut, I still pray for tomorrowAll my hopes, my dreams don't fade awayDon't fade awayI have painted many portraitsMemories of love and painThough cut down by life's deceptionsI found the strength to start againAll in all it's been a rocky roadTwists and turns along the wayBut, I still pray for tomorrowAll my hopes, my dreams don't fade awayDon't fade awayHeaven help a manTrying to make up his mindWith the darkness closing inI feel I'm running out of timeShine a light for meHelp me find the way to goAnd take me where I've never been beforeAnd so I stand at the crossroadWatching the sun sinking lowWith my cross of indecisionTrying to find the way to goAll in all it's been a rocky roadTwists and turns along the wayBut, I still pray for tomorrowAll my hopes, my dreams don't fade away
