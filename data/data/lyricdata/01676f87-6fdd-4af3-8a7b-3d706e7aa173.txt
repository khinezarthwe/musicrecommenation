Come on baby, dry your eyesWipe your tearsNever like to see you cryWon't you please forgive me?I wouldn't ever try to hurt youI just needed someone to hold meTo fill the void while you were goneTo fill this space of emptinessI'm only humanOf flesh and blood I'm madeHumanBorn to make mistakesSo many nights I longed to hold youSo many times I looked and saw your faceNothing could change the way I feelNo one else could ever take your placeI'm only humanOf flesh and blood I'm madeHumanBorn to make mistakesPlease forgive meThe tears I cry aren't tears of painThey're only to hide my guilt and shameI forgive you, now I ask the same of youWhile we were apart, I was human tooI'm only humanOf flesh and blood I'm madeHumanBorn to make mistakes
