Just as we hit the greenI've never been so happy to be aliveOnly seven miles behindYou could smell the childThe smell of the front line's survivalWith my silver BuddhaAnd my silver bullet(I pull the pin.)You learn to ride the EarthWhen you're living on your belly and the enemy are city-birthsWho need radar? We use scentThey stink of the west, stink of sweatStink of cologne and baccy, and all their Yankee hashWith my silver BuddhaAnd my silver bullet(I'm pulling on the pin,)Ooh, I pull out, pull out the pin(Pulling on the pin, oh...)Just one thing in it:Me or him. I love life!Just one thing in it:Me or him. I love life!Just one thing in it:Me or him.I love life!I love life!I love life!I've seen the coat for meI'll track him 'til he dropsThen I'll pop him one he won't seeHe's big and pink and not like meHe sees no lightHe sees no reason for the fightingWith my silver BuddhaAnd my silver bullet(I'm pulling on the pin)I had not seen his face'til I'm only feet awayUnbeknown to my preyI look in American eyesI see little lifeSee little wifeHe's striking violence up in meWith my silver BuddhaAnd my silver bullet(I'm pulling on the pin,)Ooh, I pull out, pull out the pin(Pulling on the pin, oh...)Just one thing in it:Me or him. I love life!Just one thing in it:Me or him. I love life!Just one thing in it:Me or him.And I love life!I love life!I love life!Just one thing in it:Me or him. I love life!Just one thing in it:Me or him. I love life!Just one thing in it:Me or him.And I love life!I love life!I love life!I love life!I love life!I love life!I love life!I love life!I love life!
