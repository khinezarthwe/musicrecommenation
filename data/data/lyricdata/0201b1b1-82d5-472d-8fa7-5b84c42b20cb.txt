Picture yourself in the living roomyour pipe and slippers set out for youI know you think that it ain't too farBut I hear the call of a lifetime ringfelt the need to get up for itoh you cut out the middlemanget free from the middlemanYou got no time for the messenger,got no regard for the thing that you don't understand,you got no fear of the underdog,that's why you will not survive!I want to forget how conviction fitsbut can I get out from under it?Can I gut it out of me?It can't all be wedding cakeIt can't all be boiled awayI try but I can't let go of itCan't let go of it,Cause you don't talk to the water boyand there's so much you could learn but you don't want to know,You will not back up an inch ever,that's why you will not survive,The thing that I tell you nowIt may not go over wellAnd it may not be photo-opin the way that I spell it outBut you won't hear from the messenger,don't wanna know bout something that you don't understand,You got no fear of the underdog,that's why you will not survive!
