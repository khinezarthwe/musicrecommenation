Picture yourself in the living roomyour pipe and slippers set out for you I know you think that it ain't too far But I hear the call of a lifetime ringfelt the need to get up for itoh you cut out the middlemanget free from the middleman You got no time for the messenger,got no regard for the thing that you don't understand,you got no fear of the underdog,that's why you will not survive! I want to forget how conviction fitsbut can I get out from under it? Can I gut it out of me? It can't all be wedding cake It can't all be boiled away I try but I can't let go of it Can't let go of it, Cause you don't talk to the water boyand there's so much you could learn but you don't want to know, You will not back up an inch ever,that's why you will not survive, The thing that I tell you now It may not go over well And it may not be photo-opin the way that I spell it out But you won't hear from the messenger,don't wanna know bout something that you don't understand, You got no fear of the underdog,that's why you will not survive!
