(Coverdale)I don't need a doctor, I don't need a priest,I don't need no superstitious cures for my releaseI'm flesh an' blood, skin an' boneA little petticoat company can't get me stonedSo just gimme the night,Skin it back to the bone,Turn on the spotlightC'mon, bring on the dancing girls,Bring on the dancing girls,Bring on the dancing girlsYou can dance, dance,Dance for me,Dance for your daddy all night...I got a one track notion on a feminine squeeze,A sackfull of love an' a mindful of fantasiesA midnight rider on a stallion steam,I got an old man's weakness hanging on a young man's dreamSo just gimme the night,Skin it back to the bone,Turn on the spotlightC'mon, bring on the dancing girls,Bring on the dancing girls,Bring on the dancing girlsYou can dance, dance,Dance for me,Dance for your daddy all night...So just gimme the night,Skin it back to the bone,Turn on the spotlightC'mon, bring on the dancing girls,Bring on the dancing girls...
