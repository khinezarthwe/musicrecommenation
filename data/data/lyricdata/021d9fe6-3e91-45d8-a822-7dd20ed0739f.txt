Didn't sleep last nightCouldn't calm downCold water running pass my windowKept me crying outGive me sunlightThe good medicineIt's all part of the open pressuresOf growing upMet a friendBut then againYou could get around town like they doHave a showerThen drive aroundLooking out for Northfields avenue, ohThe journey's sourThe fire's outLove achieving sounds sell a heart of glueHave a listenHer dirty mindMoving by an untold residueIt's all evolution's fault nowIt's all down to echoes in the crowdIt's all evolution's fault nowIt's all down to echoes in the crowdIt's all evolution's fault nowIt's all down to echoes in the crowd
