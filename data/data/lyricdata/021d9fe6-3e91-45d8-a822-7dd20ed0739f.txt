Didn't sleep last night Couldn't calm down Cold water running pass my window Kept me crying out Give me sunlight The good medicine It's all part of the open pressures Of growing up Met a friend But then again You could get around town like they do Have a shower Then drive around Looking out for Northfields avenue, oh The journey's sour The fire's out Love achieving sounds sell a heart of glue Have a listen Her dirty mind Moving by an untold residue It's all evolution's fault now It's all down to echoes in the crowd It's all evolution's fault now It's all down to echoes in the crowd It's all evolution's fault now It's all down to echoes in the crowd
