Just close your eyesAnd count to fiveLet's craft the only thing we know into surpriseSet down your glassI painted thisTo look like you and me forever as we're nowAnd I'm shaken then I'm stillWhen your eyes meet mine I lose simple skillsLike to tell you all I want is nowYou sing and I'm killedI'm just not the sameAs I was a year ago and each minute since thenMy jumper tearsAs we take it offAnd you say you'll sew me good as new and I know you willAnd I'm shaken then I'm stillWhen your eyes meet mine I lose simple skillsLike to tell you all I want is now
