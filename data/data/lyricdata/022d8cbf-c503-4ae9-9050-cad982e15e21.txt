I don't know just where I'm goingBut I'm gonna try for the kingdom if I can'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a manWhen I put a spike into my veinAnd I tell ya things aren't quite the sameWhen I'm rushing on my runAnd I feel just like Jesus' sonAnd I guess that I just don't knowAnd I guess that I just don't knowI have made the big decisionI'm gonna try to nullify my life'Cause when the blood begins to flowWhen it shoots up the dropper's neckWhen I'm closing in on deathAnd you can't help me now, you guysAnd all you sweet girls with all your sweet talkYou can all go take a walkAnd I guess I just don't knowAnd I guess that I just don't knowI wish that I was born a thousand years agoI wish that I'd sail the darkened seasOn a great big clipper shipGoing from this land here to thatIn a sailor's suit and capAway from the big city where a man can not be freeOf all of the evils of this townAnd of himself, and those aroundOh and I guess that I just don't knowOh and I guess that I just don't knowHeroin, be the death of meHeroin, it's my wife and it's my lifeBecause a mainer to my veinLeads to a center in my headAnd then I'm better off than deadBecause when the smack begins to flowI really don't care anymoreAbout all the Jim-Jim's in this townAnd all the politicians making busy soundsAnd everybody putting everybody else downAnd all the dead bodies piled up in mounds'Cause when the smack begins to flowThen I really don't care anymoreAh, when the heroin is in my bloodAnd that blood is in my headThen thank God that I'm as good as deadThen thank your God that I'm not awareAnd thank God that I just don't careAnd I guess I just don't knowOh and I guess I just don't know
