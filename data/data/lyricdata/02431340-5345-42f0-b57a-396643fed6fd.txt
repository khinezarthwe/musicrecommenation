Good Lord It's me-jane I heard it.. Split head.. I mean it.. Oh Me- Jane Me- Jane Oh damn your chest beating just you stop your screaming All the time you'rer hunting screaming fishing breathing Don't you ever stop and give me time to breath in? I've called you by your first name.. Good Lord it's Me- Jane I heard it.. Split head.. I mean it.. Me- Jane I'm trying To make sense.. You're screaming Don't ruin it on me Don't ruin it on me Don't ruin it all on me Tarzan I'm pleading stop your fucking screaming You know theres many walls.. I'm hanging from the ceiling Oh move it on tarzan can't you see I'm bleeding? Good Lord you never stop.. Don't ruin it on me Don't ruin it on me Don't ruin it on me Don't ruin it on me ( Jane) Don't ruin it on me ( Jane) Don't ruin it on me ( Jane) Don't ruin it on me ( Jane) Don't ruin it on me ( Jane) Don't ruin it on me ...
