Come on downThe furthest reaches of your nowhere townThey suck you inThe black hole kids won't let you free againDon't you try to shoot up the sky, to shoot up the skyTonight we'll stay aliveDon't you try to shoot up the sky, to shoot up the skyTonight we'll stay aliveWhen it's goneYou sit and stare until the golden dawnCan't you see?His arms are hell and you won't ever leaveDon't you try to shoot up the sky, to shoot up the skyTonight we'll stay aliveDon't you try to shoot up the sky, to shoot up the skyTonight we'll stay alive
