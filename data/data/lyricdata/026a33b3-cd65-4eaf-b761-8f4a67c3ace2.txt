I lost myself on a cool damp nightI gave myself in that misty lightWas hypnotized by a strange delightUnder a lilac treeI made wine from the lilac treePut my heart in its recipeIt makes me see what I want to seeAnd be what I want to beWhen I think more than I want to thinkDo things I never should doI drink much more that I ought to drinkBecause it brings me back youLilac wineIs sweet and headyLike my loveLilac wineI feel unsteadyLike my loveListen to meI cannot see clearlyIsn't that sheComing to meNearly hereLilac wineIs sweet and headyWhere's my loveLilac wineI feel unsteady,Where's my loveListen to meWhy is everything so hazyIsn't that sheOr am I just going crazy, dear?Lilac wineI feel unready for my loveFeel unreadyFor my love
