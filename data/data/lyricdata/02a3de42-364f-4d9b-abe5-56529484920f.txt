Twice I turn my back on youI fell flat on my face but didn't loseTell me where would I goTell me what led you on I'd love to knowWas it the blue nightGone fragileWas it about the menIn wonder steady gone underWas it the light waysSo frighteningWas it a two willsOne mirror holding us dearer nowThought I had an answer onceBut your random ways swept me alongColossal signs so I got lostWith so many lovers singing softWas it the blue nightGone fragileWas it about the menIn wonder steady gone underWas it the light waysSo frighteningWas it a two willsOne mirror holding us dearer now
