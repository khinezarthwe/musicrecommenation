I'm so hard for a rich girlMy heels are high, my eyes cast lowAnd I don't know how to loveI get too tired after midday, latelyI take it out on my good friendsBut the worst stays inOh, where would I begin?My office glows all night longIt's a nuclear show and the stars are goneElevator, elevator, take me homeI'm so hard for the rich girlHer heels so high and my hopes so low'Cause I don't know how to loveI'll take her home after midnightAnd if she likes, I'll tell her liesHow we'll be in love by the morningI don't think she'll know that I'm saying goodbyeMy office glows all night longIt's a nuclear show and the stars are goneElevator, elevator, take me homeMy office glows all night longIt's a nuclear show and the stars are goneElevator, elevator, take me homeDon't go, say you'll staySpend a lazy Sunday in my armsI won't take anything awayDon't go, say you'll staySpend a lazy Sunday in my armsDon't take anything awayHey-ay, hey-ay...Hey-ay, hey-ay...Hey-ay...
