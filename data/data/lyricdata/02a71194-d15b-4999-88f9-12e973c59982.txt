I'm so hard for a rich girl My heels are high, my eyes cast low And I don't know how to love I get too tired after midday, lately I take it out on my good friends But the worst stays in Oh, where would I begin? My office glows all night long It's a nuclear show and the stars are gone Elevator, elevator, take me home I'm so hard for the rich girl Her heels so high and my hopes so low' Cause I don't know how to love I'll take her home after midnight And if she likes, I'll tell her lies How we'll be in love by the morning I don't think she'll know that I'm saying goodbye My office glows all night long It's a nuclear show and the stars are gone Elevator, elevator, take me home My office glows all night long It's a nuclear show and the stars are gone Elevator, elevator, take me home Don't go, say you'll stay Spend a lazy Sunday in my arms I won't take anything away Don't go, say you'll stay Spend a lazy Sunday in my arms Don't take anything away Hey-ay, hey-ay... Hey-ay, hey-ay... Hey-ay...
