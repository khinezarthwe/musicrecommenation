Too low to find my wayToo high to wonder whyI've touched this place beforeSomewhere in another timeNow I can hear the sunThe clouds drifting through the blindsA half a million thoughtsAre flowing through my mindA satellite recalled your voiceSent me round the world againAll the night you've dreamt awaySent me round my heart againOne touch upon my lipsAnd all my thoughts are clearI feel your smoky mistUp to the stratosphereToo low to find my wayToo high to wonder whyI've touched this place beforeSomewhere in another timeNow I can hear the sunThe clouds drifting through the blindsA half a million thoughtsAre flowing through my mindToo low to find my wayToo high to wonder whyI've touched this place beforeSomewhere in another timeNow I can hear the sunThe clouds drifting through the blindsA half a million thoughtsAre flowing through my mind
