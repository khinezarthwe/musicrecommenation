Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahhLovely Rita, meter maidLovely Rita, meter maidLovely Rita, meter maidNothing can come between usWhen it gets dark I tow your heart awayStanding by a parking meterWhen I caught a glimpse of RitaFilling in the ticket in her little white bookIn a cap she looked much olderAnd the bag across her shoulderMade her look a little like a military manLovely Rita, meter maidMay I inquire discreetlyWhen are you free to take some tea with me?RitaTook her out and tried to win herHad a laugh and over dinnerTold her I would really like to see her againGot the bill and Rita paid itTook her home and nearly made itSitting on a sofa with a sister or twoOh lovely Rita, meter maidWhere would I be without you?Give us a wink and make me think of youLovely Rita, meter maidThey'll never believe it
