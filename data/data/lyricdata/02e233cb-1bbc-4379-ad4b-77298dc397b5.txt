We have both been here beforeKnocking upon love's doorBegging for someone to let us inKnowing this we can agreeTo keep each other companyNever to go down that road againMy beloved oneMy beloved oneYour eyes shine through meYou are so divine to meYour heart has a home in mineWe won't have to say a wordWith a touch all shall be heardWhen I search my heart it's you I findMy beloved oneMy beloved oneMy beloved oneYou were meant for meI believe you were sent to meFrom a dream straight into my armsHold your body close to meYou mean the most to meWe will keep each other safe from harmMy beloved oneMy beloved oneMy beloved oneMy beloved one
