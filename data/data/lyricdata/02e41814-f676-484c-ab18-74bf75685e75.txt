I close my eyesOnly for a moment and the moment´s goneAll my dreamsPass before my eyes, a curiosityDust in the windAll they are is dust in the windSame old songJust a drop of water in an endless seaAll we doCrumbles to the ground, though we refuse to seeDust in the windAll we are is dust in the windNow don´t hang onNothing lasts forever but the earth and skyIt slips awayAnd all your money won´t another minute buyDust in the windAll we are is dust in the wind (All we are is dust in the wind)Dust in the wind (Everything is dust in the wind)Everything is dust in the windIn the wind
