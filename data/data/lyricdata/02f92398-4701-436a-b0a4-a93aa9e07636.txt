Do you know who I am? I'm alive You understand? Alive Alive Alive Check your head I heard a sound Makes certain no one's around The sound The sound The sound Do you know where you're from? Don't wear round Your crumbs are gone Around Around Around Are you lost? Are you not there? Are you shut down? Are you prepared? Shut down Shut down Shut down Are you prepared for the atom bomb? Are you prepared for my aching arms? Are you prepared? Are you prepared? Are you prepared for serenity? Are you prepared to disagree? Are you prepared? Are you prepared for me? Do you know who I am? I'm alive You understand? Alive Alive Alive
