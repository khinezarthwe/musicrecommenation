We sat the sails, in July Knew too well it was final goodbye At the helm, there I stood Like a tree, awaiting the flood Over the sea and under the stars We searched the shores both near and so far Crossed the last line, the rim of the world To find reality, life, death and birth Clearsight.... Fearflight.... The tears light Clearsight.... Sheer night.... Near blight Clearsight.... Clearsight.... Clearsight Didn't know, what to find There was no water, we could not return Sailed the deserts, of the seas Four years... human debris Over the sea and under the stars We searched the shores both near and so far Crossed the last line, the rim of the world To find reality, life, death and birth Clearsight.... Fearflight.... The tears light Clearsight.... Sheer night.... Near blight Clearsight.... Clearsight.... Clearsight We fled the shallow, the modern decline The ship of fools, a cursed bark of pine...compass...dead, as sea and sky met We reached the end at the cliffs of regret H M S Clearsight, ghost of the sea Drifting the oceans forever unfree In to the storms, the rain and the mist We still sail the dreams from the deepers grave there is Clearsight.... Fearflight.... The tears light Clearsight.... Sheer night.... Near blight Clearsight.... Clearsight.... Clearsight Twilight.... Twilight.... Twilight
