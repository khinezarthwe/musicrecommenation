We sat the sails, in JulyKnew too well it was final goodbyeAt the helm, there I stoodLike a tree, awaiting the floodOver the sea and under the starsWe searched the shores both near and so farCrossed the last line, the rim of the worldTo find reality, life, death and birthClearsight....Fearflight....The tears lightClearsight....Sheer night.... Near blightClearsight....Clearsight....ClearsightDidn't know, what to findThere was no water, we could not returnSailed the deserts, of the seasFour years... human debrisOver the sea and under the starsWe searched the shores both near and so farCrossed the last line, the rim of the worldTo find reality, life, death and birthClearsight....Fearflight....The tears lightClearsight....Sheer night.... Near blightClearsight....Clearsight....ClearsightWe fled the shallow, the modern declineThe ship of fools, a cursed bark of pine...compass...dead, as sea and sky metWe reached the end at the cliffs of regretHMS Clearsight, ghost of the seaDrifting the oceans forever unfreeIn to the storms, the rain and the mistWe still sail the dreams from the deepers grave there isClearsight....Fearflight....The tears lightClearsight....Sheer night.... Near blightClearsight....Clearsight....ClearsightTwilight.... Twilight.... Twilight
