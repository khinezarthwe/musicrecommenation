I saw you in a wayBeyond figure outThese lines of lifeHave been drawn and can't be removedOur eyes is all it took to knowOpen up your eyesDeep blue, glassy lakeAnd swim till water and skyNow are one out of twoOh, my bloodshot eyesOpen up your mouthTouch your lips to mineThat we may make a kissThat can pierce through death and surviveYour words have branded my mindStill I hold your handWrapped as if a ring'Cause we of flesh and bloodAre only carryingIt's so hard to, well, you knowThe seed waits for the reaper to sowEvery breath an artThe dignity to learn itCan strain and break your heartTake all your pieces homeYou ask when you're aloneThe blood is love
