Today I passed you on the streetAnd my heart fell at your feetI can't help it if I'm still in love with youSomeone else stood by your sideShe looked so satisfiedI can't help itI'm still in love with youA picture from the past came slowly stealin'As I brushed your arm and walked so close to youThen suddenly I got that old-time feelin'I can't help itI am still in love with youIt hurts to know another's lips will kiss youAnd hold you just the way I used to doOh heaven only knows how much I miss youI can't help itI'm still in love with you
