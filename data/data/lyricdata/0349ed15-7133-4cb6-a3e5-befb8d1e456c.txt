I am a lineman for the countyAnd I drive the main roadSearching in the sun for another overloadI hear you singing in the wiresI can hear you through the whineAnd the Wichita lineman is still on the lineI know I need a small vacationBut it don't look like rainAnd if it snows that stretch down south won't ever stand the strainAnd I need you more than want youAnd I want you for all timeAnd the Wichita lineman is still on the lineAnd I need you more than want youAnd I want you for all timeAnd the Wichita lineman is still on the line
