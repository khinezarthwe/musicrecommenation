The job is done and I go outAnother boring dayI leave it all behind me nowSo many worlds awayI meet my girl, she's dressed to killAnd all we gonna doIs walk around to catch the thrillOn streets we call the zooWe eat the night, we drink the timeMake our dreams come trueAnd hungry eyes are passing byOn streets we call the zooWe eat the night, we drink the timeMake our dreams come trueAnd hungry eyes are passing byOn streets we call the zooEnjoy the zoo and walk down42nd StreetYou gonna be excited tooAnd you will feel the heatWe eat the night, we drink the timeMake our dreams come trueAnd hungry eyes are passing byOn streets we call the zooWe eat the night, we drink the timeMake our dreams come trueAnd hungry eyes are passing byOn streets we call the zoo
