What do you think they would sayIf I stood up, and I walked awayNobody here really understands meAnd so I wave goodbye, I'm fineI'm fine...Tones of homeSaid you don't like the way I'm livingYou don't like meTones of home, tones of homeAnd so I wave goodbyeI'm flyin', I'm flyin' homeAnd I always thought this would beSee the land of milk and honeyOh but I come to find out that it's all hate and moneyAnd there's a canopy of greed holding me downChorusSee I'm so high to you, so I'll fade awayI said you're on your ownYour mom and daddy saidThat you sister saidAnd you brother's saying everybodyIs saying everybodyIs saying I, eye, god I gotta go!All my friends patronize meThey say yo hey boy! Have you found what you're looking for?It seems they don't really know meCause it's here, and it's what they can't see...Chorus
