I believe I can see the future'Cause I repeat the same routineI think I used to have a purposeBut then again, it might have been a dreamI think I used to have a voiceNow I never make a soundI just do what I've been toldI really don't want them to come around, oh noEvery day is exactly the sameEvery day is exactly the sameThere is no love here and there is no painEvery day is exactly the sameI can feel their eyes are watchingIn case I lose myself againSometimes I think I'm happy hereSometimes, yet I still pretendI can't remember how this got startedBut I can tell you exactly how it will endEvery day is exactly the sameEvery day is exactly the sameThere is no love here and there is no painEvery day is exactly the sameI'm writing on a little piece of paperI'm hoping someday you might findWell I'll hide it behind somethingThey won't look behindI am still inside youA little bit comes bleeding throughI wish this could have been any other wayBut I just don't know, I don't know what else I can doEvery day is exactly the sameEvery day is exactly the sameThere is no love here and there is no painEvery day is exactly the sameEvery day is exactly the sameEvery day is exactly the sameThere is no love here and there is no painEvery day is exactly the same
