You caught me lingeringIn another girl's paradiseThe way she paints the worldI want that in my lifeEmeralds you should knowAre renting in her meadowWith a stroke beauty livesHow could I resistYou are desireWhen it all is said, said and doneWho can love you and still be standingThere's Mary calling up a stormCan I take from you and not keep taking?Naked as day Gemma follows himDoes it all come down to the thing?One girl fears in the nightIs another girl's paradiseThrough twists and turnsJasmine foxed me in her groveArms filled with honey-bellsSaint Michaels, Sanford BloodsYou have come to discover what you wantWhat I want is not to want what isn't mineBut I am desireWhen it all is said, said and doneWho can love you and still be standing?There's Mary calling up a stormCan I take from you and not keep taking?Naked as day Gemma follows himDoes it all come down to the thing?One girl fears in the nightIs another girl's paradiseAnd I know you keep telling meDoes it all come down to the thing?One girl fears in the nightIs another girlIs another girlIs another girl's paradise
