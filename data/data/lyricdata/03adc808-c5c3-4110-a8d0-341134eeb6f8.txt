I get wherever I'm going, I get whatever I need While my blood's still flowing and my heart still beats Beating like a hammer, beating like a hammer Help, I'm alive, my heart keeps beating like a hammer Hard to be soft, tough to be tender Come take my pulse, the pace is on a runaway train Help, I'm alive, my heart keeps beating like a hammer Beating like a hammer, beating like a hammer Beating like a hammer If we're still alive my regrets are few If my life is mine what shouldn't I do? I get wherever I'm going, I get whatever I need While my blood's still flowing and my heart still beating like a hammer Beating like a hammer, beating like a hammer Beating like a hammer I tremble, they're gonna eat me alive If I stumble they're gonna eat me alive Can you hear my heart beating like a hammer? Beating like a hammer, beating like a hammer Beating like a hammer Help, I'm alive, my heart keeps beating like a hammer
