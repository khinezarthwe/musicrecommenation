You've got the wrong equation Your figures fell so you make more up All's false in celebration If only you could just change your luck This time we can't lose This time we can't lose You're pushing ninety through a pretty picture Playing with the sound turned down We drive along between the cows and cotton Saying with the stars all around This time we can't lose This time we can't lose The moon is in a sickle shape You know you're only really happy just for now Looked at the city scape Well there's a planet that'll catch you and drag you back down This time we can't lose This time we can't lose This time we can't lose This time we can't lose Can't lose Can't lose
