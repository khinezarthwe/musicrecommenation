Tillin' my own grave to keep me leveledJam another dragon down the holeDigging to the rhythm and the echo of a solitary sirenOne that pushes me along and leaves me soDesperate and ravenousSo weak and powerless over youSomeone feed the monkey while I dig in search of ChinaWhite as Dracula as I approach the bottomDesperate and ravenousSo weak and powerless over youLittle angel, go away, come again some other dayThe devil has my ear, today, I'll never hear a word you sayPromised I would find a little solace and some peace of mindWhatever, just as long as I don't feel soDesperate and ravenousSo weak and powerlessDesperate and ravenousSo weak and powerless overOver you
