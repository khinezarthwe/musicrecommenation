In pitch dark I go walking in your landscapeBroken branches trip me as I speakJust 'cause you feel it, doesn't mean it's thereJust 'cause you feel it, doesn't mean it's thereThere's always a sirenSinging you to shipwreckSteer away from these rocksWe'd be a walking disasterJust 'cause you feel it, doesn't mean it's thereJust 'cause you feel it doesn't mean it's thereThere there!Why so green and lonely?And lonelyAnd lonelyHeaven sent you to meTo meTo meTo meWe are accidentsWaiting waiting to happenWe are accidentsWaiting waiting to happen
