In pitch dark I go walking in your landscape Broken branches trip me as I speak Just 'cause you feel it, doesn't mean it's there Just 'cause you feel it, doesn't mean it's there There's always a siren Singing you to shipwreck Steer away from these rocks We'd be a walking disaster Just 'cause you feel it, doesn't mean it's there Just 'cause you feel it doesn't mean it's there There there! Why so green and lonely? And lonely And lonely Heaven sent you to me To me To me To me We are accidents Waiting waiting to happen We are accidents Waiting waiting to happen
