I've lost my keyI've gone too farWas it enough to make you sick?Maybe I live again, but would I lose again my virginity?Oh, my virginityI'm shaped to get in your wayBut in the endWe defend our decadenceYou never wept like thatWhatever lost I won't forget about youOh, forget about youIt's not what I said, it's what you saidIt's what you did did that belongs to everyoneIt's not what I hate, it's what you hateIts decadence belongs to everyoneOne day I lie next to you and you stroke my impure hairYou touch my heartI forget about youOh, forget about youYou touch my...You touch my...I forget about youOh, forget about youYou touch my...My virginity
