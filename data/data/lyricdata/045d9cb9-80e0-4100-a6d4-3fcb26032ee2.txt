All the love in the world couldn't save youAll the innocence insideYou know I tried so hard to make youOh, to make you change your mindAnd it hurts too much to see youAnd how you left yourself behindYou know I wouldn't want to be youNow there's a hell I can't describeSo now I wander through my daysAnd try to find my waysTo the feelings that I feltI saved for you and no one elseAnd though as long as this road seemsI know it's called the street of dreamsBut that's not stardust on my feetIt leaves a taste that's bittersweetThat's called the bluesI don't know just what I should doEverywhere I go I see youThough it's what you planned, this much is trueWhat I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you anymoreI don't know just what I should doEverywhere I go I see youYou know it's what you planned, this much is true, oh ohWhat I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you anymore, oh oh, ahWhat this means to meIs more than I know you believeWhat I thought of you nowHas cost more that it should for meWhat I thought was true beforeWere lies I couldn't seeWhat I thought was beautifulIs only memoriesOh oh oh, what'd I tell youOh oh oh, that's what I tell youOh oh ohOh oh inside of you
