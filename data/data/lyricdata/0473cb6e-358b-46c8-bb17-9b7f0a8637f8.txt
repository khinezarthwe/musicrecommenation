The whispers in the morningOf lovers sleeping tightAre rolling by like thunder nowAs I look in your eyesI hold on to your bodyAnd feel each move you makeYour voice is warm and tenderA love that I could not forsake'Cause I am your ladyAnd you are my manWhenever you reach for meI'll do all that I canEven though there may be timesIt seems I'm far awayNever wonder where I am'Cause I am always by your side'Cause I am your ladyAnd you are my manWhenever you reach for meI'll do all that I canWe're heading for somethingSomewhere I've never beenSometimes I am frightenedBut I'm ready to learn'Bout the power of loveThe sound of your heart beatingMade it clear suddenlyThe feeling that I can't go onIs light years away'Cause I am your ladyAnd you are my manWhenever you reach for meI'm gonna do all that I canWe're heading for somethingSomewhere I've never beenSometimes I am frightenedBut I'm ready to learn'Bout the power of loveOoh The power of loveThe power of love
