It is here That vice indulged Bleeds the living Of their trust And now the Chosen children play Never to Lay rest Hand of the host Extended out From his fingers Dangles scented flesh Bodies often spun From infant minds Perfect in their Empty conception To be devoured By my lustful heart I am commanded" Do as thou wilt" Through the halls I am led Following I am led" Writhe and gnaw Each other's flesh" He lies uncovered This ancient man Of bristle and bone Hoary and unwashed His lonely soul Fills the room Our reverie lays broken Broken on the floor Cast him out into the throngs Out into unholy laughter
