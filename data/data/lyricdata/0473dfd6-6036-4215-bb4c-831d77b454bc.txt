It is hereThat vice indulgedBleeds the livingOf their trustAnd now theChosen children playNever toLay restHand of the hostExtended outFrom his fingersDangles scented fleshBodies often spunFrom infant mindsPerfect in theirEmpty conceptionTo be devouredBy my lustful heartI am commanded"Do as thou wilt"Through the hallsI am ledFollowingI am led"Writhe and gnawEach other's flesh"He lies uncoveredThis ancient manOf bristle and boneHoary and unwashedHis lonely soulFills the roomOur reverie lays brokenBroken on the floorCast him out into the throngsOut into unholy laughter
