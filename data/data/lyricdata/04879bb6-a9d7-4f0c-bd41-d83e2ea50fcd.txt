Stick around greenleaf, now that she's goneTake my time when I got to bed, and I sleep longI'm getting over, mulling overI said,Slow it down, slow it downAnd lay it low, save it for the morningI know that you would like, like to change meMake me softer to your voice like a babyI'm using caution, but you're warningI wish that you could wait to tell me in the morningSlow it down, slow it downAnd lay it low, save it for the morningI'm shouting questions, like a fist fightYou try to take me by the arms lead me to the lightI'm almost over, warring overI wish that you could wait to tell me in the morningSlow it down, slow it downAnd lay it low, save it for the morningAnd I'll tell you one more thingI confess to self deceptionAnd I broke the lock and I pried it openThen pretended to be stolenI am my own thief in the nightStruggled for many years just to get hereTo learn humility and be my own teacherI guess it backfired 'cause my motiveWas just to take and never care 'bout what I giveSlow it down, slow it downAnd lay it low, save it for the morningI'm shouting questions like a fist fightYou try to take me by the arms lead me to the lightI'm almost over, warring overI wish that you could wait to tell me in the morningSlow it down, slow it downLaying low, save it for the morningBut I'll tell you one more thingI confess to self deceptionAnd I broke the lock and I pried it openThen pretended to be stolenI am my own thief in the night
