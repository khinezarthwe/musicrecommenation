Now after all,Don't feel like nothing.Like walking away,Like a mouth full of rain.At twelve o'clockThe bell starts ringing,A dog starts barkingAnd you're still missing.Still missing somethingYou've never known what it was.And I'm not one for thinking twice,But I know this much is true.The earth will turn, the pot'll burnAnd you are my revolver.Just waking up,Some dogs start barking,A bell starts ringingAnd you're still missing.And after all,Don't you feel like nothing.Like walking awayLike a mouth full of rain.I'm holding on'Cause you're my revolverAnd I dreamed of endingAnd flying away...
