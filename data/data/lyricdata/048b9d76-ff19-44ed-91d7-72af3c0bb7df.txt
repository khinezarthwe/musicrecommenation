All that is left is an empty shellOf my heart that is crushedI don't never wanna seeWhat my mind has seenWhen you loved meEvery night, every night alone with youEvery night, alone nowWhen she sits on your lapTry to pretend to laughWhen she does stupid thingsJust like I used to doDo not hate herDon't you even tryFor to leave her is to love herThe same as you and II love youAnd I miss you tooI really do love youAnd I really do miss you tooBut I don't know youAnd I don't need youAnd I don't want you anymoreEvery night, every night alone with youEvery night, alone now
