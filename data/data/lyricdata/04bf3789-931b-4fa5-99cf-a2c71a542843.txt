If they can make a law then I can break a lawIf I can break the law will the law break me?It comes tumbling down again, I can't comprehend, is it destinyYour nomadic state, are you a refugee, no place to call your homeForever walk alone as the world goes onForgotten by the ones you've knownchorus:And all the words you gave meI lost on bended kneeBut you can't stop these cravingsJust by praying they would ceaseIf I can make a life, then I can take a lifeAnd if I save a life, will this life save meTime after time I still seem to find you're looking out for meSo wrap your arms around me, hold me close and don't let goLet me lean on you as I think things though, if I dont't we'll never know:Chorus:Will your faith save meWill I find this place where I belongCan you protect me from my troubles, keep me safe from harmWill you help me carry on
