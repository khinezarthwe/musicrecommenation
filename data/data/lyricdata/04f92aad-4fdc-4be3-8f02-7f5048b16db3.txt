Me and my baby, we had a big fightWe ended our romance the same nightIn an angry mood, he walked out the doorI said this song's going to an Aretha Franklin showHey, Aretha, sing one for meLet him know our life's in miseryWill you sing a song that will touch his heartAnd make him sorry that we are apartI don't know if taking requests is part of your showDo me this favour and I'll love you foreverMany romances have been saved by your soundYou've touched so many lovers, so many timesYes, Aretha, sing one for meLet him know our life's in miseryWill you sing a song that will touch his heart?And make him sorry that we are apart"Think", "Respect", "Call Me", "A Bridge Over Troubled Waters"And "I Can't See Myself Leaving You"Hey, Aretha, sing one for meLet him know I'm as miserable as a woman can beSing a song that will touch his heartSo he'll be sorry that we are apart"Think", "Respect", "Call Me", "I Never Loved a Man Like I Love You"And "I Can't See Myself Leaving You"
