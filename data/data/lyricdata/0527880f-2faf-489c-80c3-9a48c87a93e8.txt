Welcome to a tripInto my hurt feelingsTo the center of my soulYou better bring a lightTo find the house of meaningsIn the labyrinth of yes or noFor you, life is just like chessIf you don't make the moveYou'll lose the game like thisCause you, you're walking on the edgeYou, you choose the way of loving painYou, don't you see the bridgeI've built for you, it's just one step to start againWelcome to a tripInto my emotionsTo the language of my heartYou're sailing on a riverThat becomes an oceanWhich you can only cross with love
