Since I met youThis small town hasn't got roomFor my big feelingsViolently happy'Cause I love youViolently happyBut you're not hereViolently happyCome calm me downBefore I get into troubleI tip-toe down to the shoreStand by the oceanMake it roar at meAnd I roar backViolently happy'Cause I love youViolently happyBut you're not hereViolently happyOveremotionalViolently happyI'll get in troubleReal soonIf you don't get hereBaby!Violently happy'Cause I love youViolently happyI'm aiming too highViolently happyIt will get me into troubleViolently happyI'm driving my carToo fastWith ecstatic music onViolently happyI'm getting too drunkViolently happyI'm daring peopleTo jump off roofs with meOnly youCan clam me downI'm aiming too highSoothe me
