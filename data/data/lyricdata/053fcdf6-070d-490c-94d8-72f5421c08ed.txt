Sleeping beauty Where have you been You should know I´m counting on you here Feels like clouds beneath your wings It is night, you see it as it is It is dark, have mercy on us all You should know I´m counting on you here His kiss His kiss His kiss His kiss of spring His kiss of spring His kiss of spring His kiss of spring His kiss... Let´s talk about the weather And the snow Falling from the heavens like crystal feather The power of the powder The silence screams louder I feel cold This is a nation on hold It´s the chill Without the thrill I´m waiting for spring to come to my kingdom Come to my kingdom I´m waiting for spring to come to my kingdom Come to my kingdom I manage to get down to the coffee shop It´s the big freeze, I feel like a pork chop Jesus it´s cold, must be a million below Nowhere to go, and the snow still falling Everything´s gone white Still nothing looks bright There´s no signs of daylight Every day is like an eternal night I´m out of here soon I might be back in June It´s the chill Without the thrill It´s the chill I´m waiting for spring to come to my kingdom Come to my kingdom His kiss His kiss His kiss His kiss of spring His kiss of spring His kiss of spring Spring His kiss of spring His kiss It´s the chill Without the thrill It´s the chill I´m waiting for spring to come to my kingdom I´m waiting for spring to come to my kingdom You should know I´m waiting for spring to come to my kingdom I´m counting on you here His kiss of spring His kiss I´m waiting for spring to come to my kingdom His kiss of spring I´m waiting for spring to come to my kingdom His kiss of spring It´s the chill Without the thrill I´m waiting for spring to come to my kingdom To my kingdom
