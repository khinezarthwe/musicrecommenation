The selfish, they're all standing in lineFaithing and hoping to buy themselves timeMe, I figure as each breath goes byI only own my mindThe north is to south what the clock is to timeThere's east and there's west and there's everywhere lifeI know I was born and I know that I'll dieThe in-between is mineI am mineAnd the feeling, it gets left behindAll the innocence lost at one timeSignificant behind the eyesThere's no need to hideWe're safe tonightThe ocean is full 'cause everyone's cryingThe full moon is looking for friends at high tideThe sorrow grows bigger when the sorrow's deniedI only know my mindI am mineAnd the meaning, it gets left behindAll the innocence lost at one timeSignificant behind the eyesThere's no need to hideWe're safe tonight, whoaAnd the feelings that get left behindAll the innocence broken with liesSignificance between the linesWe may need to hideAnd the meanings that get left behindAll the innocence lost at one timeWe're all different behind the eyesThere's no need to hide
