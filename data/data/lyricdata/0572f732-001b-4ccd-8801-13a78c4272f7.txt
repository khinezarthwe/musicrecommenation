Can I hold you one last timeTo fight the feeling that is growing in my mindI know I did us both all so wrongI know I'm not always all that strongA-b-c-d-e-f and -gOh that reminds me of when we were freeBefore life began to tear us apartRemember those classes when we thought we were so smartOooooooohOooooooohWe were lovers in every wayLeft school together, went back to my placeNow I can hardly remember her faceBefore I met her I was.. sadOooooooohOooooooohAnd can I hold you one last timeTo fight this feeling that is growing in my mind
