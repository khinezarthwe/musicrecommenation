"Oh, look at me," that sweet boy's pleaHis mother cried, "My child's tied his laces"Why must we move on from such happy lawnsInto nostalgia's palm and feed on the traces?Do you hop to the dance or embarrass the parents?Who should I please? I'll go to sleep worryingThat blood in the dark will attract the sharksWho are not violent, we've all got hungry belliesBut where are the still unbornsWho could look at me with the one eye?Who could look at me with no eyes?So you look at me with me in their eyesAnd oh, what's pain?And oh, what's sadness anyway?It's not crying like a childAnd oh, what's graying?And oh, what's ageing anyway?It's not growing in the wildBut I feel like I've just been bornWhen you look at me with your green eyesWhen you look at me with your black eyesWhen you look at me with your dead eyesAnd I can't understand when holding her handSo womanly, I have to go kiss herAnd what a surprise to look in those eyesTo find suddenly, he is Jack the RipperToo suddenly, he was Jack the RipperThere he goesStop crying like a childShe stopped crying like a childJack the RipperJack the RipperJack the Ripper
