This songIs one I never thought that I'd playBut if you want me goneThere are kinder ways to saySo long than spitting in my faceThey don't teach these things at schoolThey just lay down the rules which are there for you to breakWhich are there for you to breakIf I'm wrongThen dust me off and put me in my place, butDrop a bombShall you blow me away without even a trace?I'll be gone and I won't give chase'Cause when you're in pieces, you pick up the bits, and nothing fits, and the wind blowsYou awayOh, the wind blows you awayOh, the wind blows you awayOh, the wind blows you awayI prayThere will come a time when I think of you and I'll smileThese daysEverything seems to last only a whileRemember the namesFor the day when we'd have a childBut the trouble with dreams, they're not what they seem, 'cause when you awake,They fall through your fingersIn flakesThey fall through your fingers in flakesThey fall through your fingers in flakesThey fall through your fingers in flakes
