I hear the sound of distant thunder echo all aroundI see the tragedy of young ones lying on the groundI see the fathers' sons and daughters, I hear the mothers cryingNothing left for me to do, whisper a prayer for the dyingOh, oh, a prayer for the dyingThe suffocating heat of jungles, burning desert sandsWhere everything reminds you, you're a stranger in a strange landThe soothing words of politicians, those bodyguards of liesWhile guardian angels waste their time and every mother criesOh, oh, a prayer for the dying, dying, dyingOh, ohMachine gun, battle cryYou pray to God when the bullets flyThe bombs fall like black rainAnd all your dreams take you home againNothing but bad dreamsYou can't read, you can't writeYou're so scared, you can't sleep at nightYou try to carry the heavy loadWalking down Armageddon road, oh, Armageddon roadI hear the sound of distant thunder echo all aroundI see the tragedy of young ones lying on the groundI see the fathers' sons and daughters, I hear the mothers cryingNothing left for me to do but whisper a prayer for the dyingOh, a prayer for the dying, dyingOh, a prayer for the dying, baby, babyOh, a prayer for the dying, dyingWhisper a prayer for the dying, ohYou can't run, you can't hideYou can't show what you feel insideYou're going crazy, going insaneYou know you'll never be the same again, no, noWhisper a prayer for the dying, dying, dying, dying, dying, no, noArmageddon road, Armageddon road, I'm walking down Armageddon road
