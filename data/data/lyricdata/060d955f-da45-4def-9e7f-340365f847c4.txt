Look in your eyesAnd I see the liesBut in my mindIt's a mysteryFeeling the painAnd I feel the loveAnd once againYou're the world to meHey, what is this thing I'm feeling, babyWhat are these strange emotionsLoving the pleasure sweetlyLoving the pain as deeplyIt's almost midnightAnd my love is coming downLots of ladies love meBut it's still a lonesome town(Very special loveVery special love affair)You've got me looking for loveThough you're my sole desireLooking for love & a girl for meYou've got me looking for loveAnd my soul's on fireLooking for love & a girl for meMemories of our love obsesses meIf I gave into your soul, my dearThen you really never could be mine
