Captured Clandestine,Crawled into the light,Knew he was in for a shoe-ing,Just wasn't to be his night.Dragged out of the frozen Rhine,For the Motherland,and the third reich,a toe-ing's as good as a shoeing,when it's not to be your night,your night.Tred carefully,so carefully,upon the drifting icefought behind enemy lines,In 1939,for Germany,he sacrificed his life,caught behind enemy lines,in 1939.Kids knee deep in rubble,London urchins grey with dust,Packed off west in evacuation,to farmers wife green and pleasent life,far from the doodble bugs.Nana doll still remembers,leaving town in worn-out shoes,Now she's back out west,in sheltered accomodation,Homes for the old,where pills arent the only blues.Tred carefully,so carefully,on the drifting icestaring blank into the tv guide,In 2009,oh how it's hurting me,I've only seen her twicesince she went west for the second timesince 1939.
