This is how it begins Push it away but it all comes back again All the flesh, all the sin There was a time when it used to mean just about everything Just like now Just like now Breathe, echoing the sound Time starts slowing down Sink until I drown I don't ever want to make it stop And it keeps repeating Will you please complete me? Never be enough to fill me up Never be enough to fill me up Never be enough to fill me up Never be enough to fill me up Watch the white Turn to red It fills up the hole but it grows somewhere else instead All my life Yeah yeah yeah yeah, but it just left me dead The world is over and I realize it was all in my head Now everything is clear I erase the fear I can disappear I don't ever want to make it stop You can never leave me Will you please complete me? Never be enough to fill me up Never be enough to fill me up Never be enough to fill me up Never be enough to fill me up Never be enough to fill me up Never be enough to fill me up Never be enough to fill me up Never be enough to fill me up
