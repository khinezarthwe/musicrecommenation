This is how it beginsPush it away but it all comes back againAll the flesh, all the sinThere was a time when it used to mean just about everythingJust like nowJust like nowBreathe, echoing the soundTime starts slowing downSink until I drownI don't ever want to make it stopAnd it keeps repeatingWill you please complete me?Never be enough to fill me upNever be enough to fill me upNever be enough to fill me upNever be enough to fill me upWatch the whiteTurn to redIt fills up the hole but it grows somewhere else insteadAll my lifeYeah yeah yeah yeah, but it just left me deadThe world is over and I realize it was all in my headNow everything is clearI erase the fearI can disappearI don't ever want to make it stopYou can never leave meWill you please complete me?Never be enough to fill me upNever be enough to fill me upNever be enough to fill me upNever be enough to fill me upNever be enough to fill me upNever be enough to fill me upNever be enough to fill me upNever be enough to fill me up
