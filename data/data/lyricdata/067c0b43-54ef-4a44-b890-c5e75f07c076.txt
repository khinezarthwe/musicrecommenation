Closed eyes in the darkWhispering when no one's aroundThe night sky looks like blueMy touch does not affect youI wait for them to follow meLike sugarplums, like sugar dropsI wait for them to conquer me againI can't say yes, I can't say no to youWe bring our stories with usWe light a candle for beauty's sakeAre you feeling the blissAre you dying? I amI wait for them to follow meWith sugarplums, with sugardropsI wait for them to follow me againI can't say yes, I can't say no to youI wait for them to conquer me againI can't say yes, I can't say no to you
