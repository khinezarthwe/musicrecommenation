Closed eyes in the dark Whispering when no one's around The night sky looks like blue My touch does not affect you I wait for them to follow me Like sugarplums, like sugar drops I wait for them to conquer me again I can't say yes, I can't say no to you We bring our stories with us We light a candle for beauty's sake Are you feeling the bliss Are you dying? I am I wait for them to follow me With sugarplums, with sugardrops I wait for them to follow me again I can't say yes, I can't say no to you I wait for them to conquer me again I can't say yes, I can't say no to you
