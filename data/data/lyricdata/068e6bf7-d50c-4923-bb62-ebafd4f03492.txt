Smeared black inkYour palms are sweatyAnd I'm barely listeningTo last demandsI'm staring at the asphalt wonderingWhat's buried underneathWhere I amI wear my badgeA vinyl sticker with big block lettersAdhering to my chestThat tells your new friends:I am a visitor here; I am not permanentAnd the only thingKeeping me dry is(Where I am)You seem so out of contextIn this gaudy apartment complexA stranger with your door keyExplaining that I'm just visitingAnd I am finally seeingWhy I was the one worth leavingWhy I was the one worth leavingD.C. sleeps alone tonight(Where I am)You seem so out of contextIn this gaudy apartment complexA stranger with your door keyExplaining that I'm just visitingAnd I am finally seeingWhy I was the one worth leavingWhy I was the one worth leaving(Where I am)The district sleeps alone tonightAfter the bars turn out their lightsAnd send the autos swervingInto the loneliest eveningAnd I am finally seeingWhy I was the one worth leavingWhy I was the one worth leavingWhy I was the one worth leavingWhy I was the one worth leaving
