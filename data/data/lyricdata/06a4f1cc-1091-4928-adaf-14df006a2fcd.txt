Who told you love is the Alpha and Omega?And that your heart will lead you to the only one?It's a curse, it's the hammer that will break you,It's a poison hidden in a bon bonDon't you know love is stronger than Jesus?Don't you know love can kill anyone?Bring it on; wars and diseasesYou know that love can do you like a shotgunCan't resist them, the sailors and the soldiersTaking aim, a rabbit on a rifle rangePay no mind to what your mama told youYou're the fool who's chasing down the candy caneIt's a riddle how lovers can stay aliveBut we bloom and breathe in all declineDon't you know love is stronger than Jesus?Don't you know love can kill anyone?So bring it on; wars and diseasesYou know that love can do you like a shotgunO, oh noO, oh noSee the people heading for disasterStanding in line just looking for a little funLove is a fire, a hot hot blasterAnd we're the Belgians burning in the Congo sunWe'll believe there's trust in strangersAny monkey looking like a saviorIt's a riddle howWe're still living nowOh, how little we know, ohDon't you know love is stronger than Jesus?Don't you know love can kill anyone?So bring it on; wars and diseasesYou know that love can do you like a shotgunX2
