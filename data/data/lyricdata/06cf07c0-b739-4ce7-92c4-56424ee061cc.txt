Give me back my broken nightMy mirrored room, my secret lifeIt's lonely hereThere's no one left to tortureGive me absolute controlOver every living soulAnd lie beside me, babyThat's an order!Give me crack and anal sexTake the only tree that's leftAnd stuff it up the holeIn your cultureGive me back the Berlin WallGive me back Stalin and St. PaulI've seen the future, brotherIt is murderThings are going to slide in all directionsWon't be nothingNothing you can measure anymoreThe blizzard of the worldHas crossed the thresholdAnd it's overturnedThe order of the soulWhen they said, "Repent"I wonder what they meantWhen they said, "Repent"I wonder what they meantWhen they said, "Repent"I wonder what they meantYou don't know me from the windYou never will, you never didI'm the little JewWho wrote the bibleI've seen the nations rise and fallI've heard their stories, heard them allBut love's the only engine of survivalYour servant here, he has been toldTo say it clear, to say it coldIt's over, it ain't goingAny furtherAnd now the wheels of heaven stopYou feel the devil's riding cropGet ready for the futureIt is murderThings are going to slide in all directions...There'll be the breaking of the ancientWestern codeYour private life will suddenly explodeThere'll be phantomsThere'll be fires on the roadAnd the white man dancingYou'll see your womanHanging upside downHer features covered by her fallen gownAnd all the lousy little poetsComing aroundTrying to sound like Charlie MansonGive me back the Berlin WallGive me Stalin and St. PaulGive me ChristOr give me HiroshimaDestroy another fetus nowWe don't like children anyhowI've seen the future, babyIt is murderThings are going to slide in all directions...
