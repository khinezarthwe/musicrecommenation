Better stop dreaming of the quiet life'Cause it's the one we'll never knowAnd quit running for the runaway bus'Cause those rosy days are fewAnd stop apologizing for the things you've never done'Cause time is short and life is cruelBut it's up to us to changeThis town called MaliceRows and rows of disused milk floatsStand dying in the dairy yardAnd a hundred lonely housewivesClutch empty milk bottles to their heartsHanging out their old love letters on the line to dryIt's enough to make you stop believingWhen tears come fast and furiousIn a town called MaliceYeahStruggle after struggle, year after yearThe atmosphere's a fine blend of iceI'm almost stone cold deadIn a town called MaliceOoh, yeahA whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beefGets dashed against the co-opTo either cut down on beer or the kids' new gearIt's a big decision in a town called MaliceOoh, yeahOohThe ghost of a steam train echoes down my trackIt's at the moment bound for nowhereJust going 'round and 'round, ohPlayground kids and creaking swingsLost laughter in the breezeI could go on for hours and I probably willBut I'd sooner put some joy back inThis town called Malice, oohThis town called Malice, yeahThis town called Malice
