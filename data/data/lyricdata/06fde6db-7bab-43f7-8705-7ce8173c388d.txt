He came from somewhere back in her long ago The sentimental fool don't see Tryin' hard to recreate what had yet to be created Once in her life she musters a smile For his nostalgic tale Never coming near what he wanted to say Only to realize It never really was She had a place in his life He never made her think twice As he rises to her apology Anybody else would surely know He's watching her go But what a fool believes he sees No wise man has the power To reason away What seems to be Is always better than nothing And nothing at all Keeps sending him Somewhere back in her long ago Where he can still believe there's a place in her life Someday, somewhere She will return She had a place in his life He never made her think twice As he rises to her apology Anybody else would surely know He's watching her go But what a fool believes he sees No wise man has the power To reason away What seems to be ( If love can come and love can go, then why can't love return once more?) Is always better than nothing ( Fool's got the power) And nothing at all ( Oh, now) What a fool believes ( I believe she's never gone away) He sees ( Oh) No wise man has the power ( To reason away) To reason away What seems to be ( Oh, if love can come and love can go, oh, mama) Is always better than nothing ( Better than nothing) And nothing at all
