Why do you let me stay hereAll by myselfWhy don't you come and play hereI'm just staying on the shelfWhy don't you sit right down and stay a whileWe like the same things and I like your styleIt's not a secretWhy do you keep itI'm just sitting on the shelfI've gotta get your presentsLet's make it knownI think you're just so pleasantI would like you for my ownWhy don't you sit right down and make me smileYou make me feel like I am just a childWhy do you edit?Just give me creditI'm just sitting on the shelf
