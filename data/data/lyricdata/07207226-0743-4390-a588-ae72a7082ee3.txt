Yellow sun is shining in the afternoonI'd really like to tell you but I feel it's too soonMy actions are dictated by the phase of the moonThe phase of the moonThe sun, it isn't hiding when it sets on youIt's not a coward like me and I know that it's trueWaiting for the darkness now is all I can doIt's all I can doAnd if the sun should follow us into your roomThen the courage will be wrought from me to tell you the truthThe setting sun's the only thing that's shining on youThat's shining on youYou're making me hungryBut what's really funny is it's not sunny anymoreAnd when I finally told you when the sun has goneYou're laughing 'cause you thought I was the only oneAnd the only thing that's left for me is the rising sunThe rising sunYou're making me hungryYou're making me hungryBut what's really funny is it's not sunny anymoreYou're making me hungryYou're making me hungryBut what's really funny is it's not sunny anymoreIt's not sunny anymore
