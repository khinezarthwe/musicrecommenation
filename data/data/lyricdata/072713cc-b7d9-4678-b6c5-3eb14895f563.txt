Living life Don't you cry My life Pain is God Many nights Painful thoughts occur Yell at me, Again I'm wrong In denial I tried to be your friend I tried to be A good boy All I see A hate deep inside Startle me Someone save me Now these memories Fill my heart They bury me All I want to do( You are not my real mother) Is kill you( Should I beat and stab and fuck her?) All I want to do( You are not my real mother) Is kill you( Should I beat and stab and fuck her?) All I want to do( You are not my real mother) Is kill you( Should I beat and stab and fuck her?) Looking back I was never ever right You were my stepmom Who always wanted me out of your sight I would come walking in and I'd say, " Hello" But you would slap me And you would make some fucked-up comment about my clothes But I tried to let it pass But the pictures in my head were with you With a knife up your ass laying dead So I popped some more caps in your ass Now your son is not so fun Motherfucking bitch, never try to play me! You make my life Not so good All I want to do Is kill you All I want to do Is kill you All I want to do( You are not my real mother) Is kill you( Should I beat and stab and fuck her?) All I want to do( You are not my real mother) Is kill you( Should I beat and stab and fuck her?) Wish! Ha ha! You! Ha! Were dead! Ha ha! Now! Ha ha! Now I know. How can I cry over someone I never loved? Now I know. How can I cry over someone I never loved? Never loved Never loved
