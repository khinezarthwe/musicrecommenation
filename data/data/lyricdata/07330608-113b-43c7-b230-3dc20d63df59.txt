When you said, "It's a touch too much", I knew, I knewThat I'd be walking home againI lift my head and it falls againI take a step and I fall, I never asked for muchWatch my hand in a shaking loveAnd it is always thus I never asked for muchWhen you said, "It's a touch too much", I knew, I knewThat I'd be walking home againIf I said enough's enough you'd knowI'd call on your brother, he would showIt'd be on his face, I would not stareBut beyond our best attempts we'd careIt was a really long time ago when you were a friend of mineAnd I would really like you to know, it would help to ease my mindI would hold you up again if you ask meWhen you said, "It's a touch too much", I knew, I knewThat I'd be walking home again
