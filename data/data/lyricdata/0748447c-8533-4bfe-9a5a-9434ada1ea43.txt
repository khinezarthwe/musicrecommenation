Let's meet in the city whereThe rivers cross bridges thereLet's float down into the streamOf rich and poor pioneersA kid from a western townWants to be seen and go outLet's borrow my parent's carLet's stay out all night up thereAnd Burnside will be our streetWhere the kids and the hookers meetDiners and strip club junkBookstores and punk rock clubsWater, Building and Sin(I'm as green as this blade in the grass that bends)Big Oregon city draws you in(In the wind that blows on the long weekends)A promise fulfilled or not(Where I take the bridge to the water fountains)Just hang on until the summer, it's hot(And to gain the hope that the city brings)We'll make our home water-tightWork all day, play all nightAnd hope we're not washed awayBy deceit or tragedyAnd Joan of Arc rules NortheastWhere the poor and the hipsters meetThe grid that divides us allThe river makes final callOut at the edge of townWhere airfield runs water downCoyote crosses the tracksAnd hops on the Light-Rail MaxWater, Building and Sin(I'm as green as this blade in the grass that bends)Big Oregon city draws you in(In the wind that blows on the long weekends)A promise fulfilled or not(Where I take the bridge to the water fountains)Just hang on until the summer, it's hot(And to gain the hope that the city brings)And if you wanna be a friend of mineCross the river to the east sideFind me on the eve of suicideTell me the city is no place to hideTake me out into a sunny dayThrough the grotto or the promenadeYou came to me in the nick of timeThankful for the things I left behindOh dirty river, come let me in    (3X)Oh dirty river
