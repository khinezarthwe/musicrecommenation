Midnight to six man For the first time from Jamaicaand a, your cool operatorfor U K pop reggae With backing band sound system If they've got anything to say There's plenty black ears here to listen But it wasall night with encores from stage right Charging from the bass, knives to the treble But on stage they ain't got no roots rock rebel On stage they ain't got no roots Rock rebel Dress back, jump back, this is a blue beat attack Cause it won't get you anywhere Fooling with your guns The British Army is waiting out there Weighs fifteen hundred tons White youth, black youth Better find another solution Why not phone up Robin Hood And ask him for some wealth distribution Punk rockers in the U K They won't notice anyway They're all too busy fighting For a good place under the lighting The new groups are not concerned With what there is to be learned They got Burton suits, you think it's funny Turning rebellion into money All over people changing their votes Along with their overcoats If Adolf Hitler flew in today They'd send a limousine anyway I'm the all night drug prowling wolf Who looks so sick in the sun I'm the white man in the Palais Just oh looking for fun I'm only looking for fun Please mister, just leave me alone I'm only looking for fun
