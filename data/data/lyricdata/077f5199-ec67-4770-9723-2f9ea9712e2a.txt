For you, we steal a house of smoke and brickAnd I keep it allFor you, bedecked with bicycles to pickI keep it allFor you, it wouldn't do wandering all adriftSo I keep it allFor you, there's fire in the belly of our shipI keep it allCall if the light's on, come in and lay lowJust so that you know, go on andFall down and hold your groundA harbour that growsAnd how could you knowThat I keep it allFor you, we fill our sails with tales and fablesI keep it allFor you, to bear you through stormy seas unstableI keep it allFor you, you're welcome to all that's on my tableI keep it allAnd you, I count you till I fall asleepI keep it allCall if the light's on, come in and lay lowJust so that you know, go on andFall down and hold your groundA harbour that growsAnd how could you knowThat I keep it allWhat you say we come up with the sun the morning bell toCome and be my friend until the end I'll be your friend as well
