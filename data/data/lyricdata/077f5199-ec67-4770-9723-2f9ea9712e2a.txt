For you, we steal a house of smoke and brick And I keep it all For you, bedecked with bicycles to pick I keep it all For you, it wouldn't do wandering all adrift So I keep it all For you, there's fire in the belly of our ship I keep it all Call if the light's on, come in and lay low Just so that you know, go on and Fall down and hold your ground A harbour that grows And how could you know That I keep it all For you, we fill our sails with tales and fables I keep it all For you, to bear you through stormy seas unstable I keep it all For you, you're welcome to all that's on my table I keep it all And you, I count you till I fall asleep I keep it all Call if the light's on, come in and lay low Just so that you know, go on and Fall down and hold your ground A harbour that grows And how could you know That I keep it all What you say we come up with the sun the morning bell to Come and be my friend until the end I'll be your friend as well
