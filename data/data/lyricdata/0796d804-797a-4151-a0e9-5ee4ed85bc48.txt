When the daylight is falling down into the nightAnd the sharks try to cut a big piece out of lifeIt feels allright to go out to catch an outrageous thrillBut it's more like spinning wheels of fortuneWhich never stand stillBig city, big city nightsYou keep me burningBig city, big city nightsWhen the sunlight is rising up in my eyesAnd the long night has left me back at somebody's sideIt feels allright for a long sweet minute like hours beforeBut it's more like looking out for somethingI can't find anymoreBig city, big city nightsYou keep me burningBig city, big city nightsAlways yearningBig city, big city nightsYou keep me burningBig city, big city nightsThere is no dreamThat you can't make true, if you're looking for loveBut there's no girlWho's burning the ice away from my heartMaybe tonightBig city, big city nightsYou keep me burningBig city, big city nightsAlways yearningBig city, big city nightsYou keep me burningBig city, big city nightsAlways yearningBig city, big city nightsYou keep me burningBig city, big city nightsAlways yearningBig city, big city nightsYou keep me burning
