Raise the dead to hear them scream againIt's a prize in its own rightEqual in death at last,with no exceptions madeThere's no escape in this andthat's how it endsThis is my ceremonyA blood rite to spite your kindSmalltown kings and queensFalling over-it's so concealed.So let this day remain and linger(until) the memories come crawling your waySinking deeper,closer to who you wereThe pain will truthfullybring you homeThis is my ceremonyA blood rite to spite your kindA fire burning deep within meBecome stone in timesink it into oblivion, endless.CrawlBecome the master of this pyramidVenomRuns like blood through you veinsThe more you deny itthe closer it getsResisting is futile,this ends in a coffin kiss.This is my ceremonyA blood rite to spite your kindA fire burning deep within me
