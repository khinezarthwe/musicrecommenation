Raise the dead to hear them scream again It's a prize in its own right Equal in death at last,with no exceptions made There's no escape in this andthat's how it ends This is my ceremony A blood rite to spite your kind Smalltown kings and queens Falling over-it's so concealed. So let this day remain and linger(until) the memories come crawling your way Sinking deeper,closer to who you were The pain will truthfullybring you home This is my ceremony A blood rite to spite your kind A fire burning deep within me Become stone in timesink it into oblivion, endless. Crawl Become the master of this pyramid Venom Runs like blood through you veins The more you deny itthe closer it gets Resisting is futile,this ends in a coffin kiss. This is my ceremony A blood rite to spite your kind A fire burning deep within me
