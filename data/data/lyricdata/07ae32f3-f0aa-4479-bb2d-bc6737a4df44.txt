Living on my guard( Glory) Wind is on my neck( Fearless) Sun is on my face( Courage)... A beautiful day without you( Like rays of gold In all this decay How can I forget the pain?) Living on my guard( Glory) Wind is on my neck( Fearless) Sun is on my face( Courage)... A beautiful day without you( Feel unspoiled In this world Confiding beliefs How can I?) I know my tragedy Notion took a bow Still I wonder how Morning after rain Clear away the pain Then, after all, when all are gone It's plain to see, just who we are In light of hate, the way we talk And act in shame 'causing harm" Defend yourself 'n keep your guard!" We realize we belong apart'cause beyond ties we've got Ways of knowing Living on my guard( Glory) Wind is on my neck( Fearless) Sun is on my face( Courage)... A beautiful day without you( Like rays of gold In all this decay Now can I forget the pain?) Living on my guard( Holy) Wind is on my neck( Fearless) Sun is on my face( Courage)... A beautiful day without you( Feel unspoiled In this world Confiding beliefs Now can I?) When, I'm alone, and all are gone This pain it leaves, onto the sun In light of good I see myself Approving things of everyday The open sky, the breathing stars Will leave me calm in a world apart 'cause In these times there's no Way of knowing Living on my guard( Glory) Wind is on my neck( Fearless) Sun is on my face( Courage)... A beautiful day without you( Like rays of gold In all this decay How can I forget the pain?) Living on my guard( Holy) Wind is on my neck( Fearless) Sun is on my face Courage... A beautiful day without you( Still unspoiled Feeling refined This beautiful day It's a sign)
