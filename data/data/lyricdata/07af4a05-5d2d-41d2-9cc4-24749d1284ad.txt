The movers and the shakersâ€¦ I just don't know how to bring about Your downfall, damn fool go figure out How those Christian bones can orchestrate? Shock and awe Can't find peace to rave about Shade from trees to sit and celebrate Space between these graves to cultivate Anymore No time to grieve or think about Plans to search for grace, investigate How this holy mess could generate love at war Listen follow Follow closely It's closely sinking' Cos the war is moving Getting closer to you You feel it breathing That stinking feeling It's what I'm thinking for Don't want to fight for a feeling(the movers and the shakers) We need a spud and not a peeling(the movers and the shakers) Don't need another undertaker(the movers and the shakers) Be a mover and a shaker(the movers and the shakers) I can't hide much I can't hide much Listen follow Follow closely It's closely sinking' Cos the war is moving It's getting closer to you You feel it breathing That stinking feeling It's what I'm thinking for It's what I'm thinking for It's why I'm thinking for It's what I'm thinking for I just can't hide much I just can't hide much I just can't hide much I just can't hide much I just can't hide much Don't want to fight for a feeling We need a better kinder dreaming Don't need another fool, a faker Be a mover and a shaker
