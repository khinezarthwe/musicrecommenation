I see you from the skyAnd I wonder how long it'll take me to get homeI wait for an hour or so at the carouselI have a cigarette to pass the time'Cause the traffic's hellAhhh, I don't want anything moreThan to see your face when you open the doorYou'll make me beans on toast and a nice cup of teaAnd we'll get a Chinese and watch TVTomorrow we'll take the dog for a walkAnd in the afternoon, then maybe we'll talkI'll be exhausted so I'll probably sleepAnd we'll get a Chinese and watch TVYou wipe the tears from my eyeAnd you say that all that it takes is a phone callI cry at the thought of being alone and thenI wonder how long it'll take 'til I'm home againAhhh, I don't want anything moreThan to see your face when you open the doorYou'll make me beans on toast and a nice cup of teaAnd we'll get a Chinese and watch TVTomorrow we'll take the dog for a walkAnd in the afternoon, then maybe we'll talkI'll be exhausted so I'll probably sleepAnd we'll get a Chinese and watch TVI know it doesn't seem so fairBut I'll send you a postcard when I get thereI don't want anything moreThan to see your face when you open the doorYou'll make me beans on toast and a nice cup of teaAnd we'll get a Chinese and watch TVTomorrow we'll take the dog for a walkAnd in the afternoon, then maybe we'll talkI'll be exhausted so I'll probably sleepAnd we'll get a Chinese and watch TV
