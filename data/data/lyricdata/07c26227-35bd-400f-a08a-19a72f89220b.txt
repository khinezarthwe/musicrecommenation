1, 2, 3, 4!All alone in my roomThink of you at a rate that is truly alarmingI keep looping my memories of you in my headI pretend that you want meAnd I fall asleep and dream of alternate realitiesAnd I put myself at ease by pretending that she still loves meAnd I can't stop thinking about youAnd I can't stop thinking about youAnd you never call, what do I do?And I can't stop thinking about your love, oh yeahCan't believe I could thinkThat she would just follow me everywhere I goI just wrestle with you in my dreamsAnd wake up making love to a pillowAnd I fall asleep and dream of alternate realitiesAnd I put myself at ease by pretending that she still loves meAnd I can't stop thinking about youAnd I can't stop thinking about youAnd you never call, what do I do?And I can't stop, and I can't stopWhat I would give to have you look in my directionAnd I'd give my life to somehow attract your attentionAnd I touch myself like it's somebody elseThoughts of you are tattooed on my mind, let me show youAnd I can't stop thinking about youAnd I can't stop thinking about youAnd you never call, what do I do?And I can't stop thinking about youAnd I can't stop thinking about youAnd I can't stop thinking about youAnd you never call, what do I do?I can't stop thinking about you
