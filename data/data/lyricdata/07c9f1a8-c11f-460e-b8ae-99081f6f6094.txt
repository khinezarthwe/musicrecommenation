Who knows how long I've loved you?You know I love you stillWill I wait a lonely lifetime?If you want me to I willFor if I ever saw youI didn't catch your nameBut it never really matteredI will always feel the sameLove you forever and foreverLove you with all my heartLove you whenever we're togetherLove you when we're apartAnd when at last I find youYour song will fill the airSing it loud so I can hear youMake it easy to be near youFor the things you do endear you to meOh, you know I willI willMmDa-da-da-da-da-da da
