I can feel a new expression on my faceI can feel a glowing sensation taking placeI can hear the guitars playing lovely tunesEvery time that you walk in the roomI close my eyes for a second and pretend it's me you wantMeanwhile I try to act so nonchalantI see a summer's night with a magic moonEvery time that you walk in the roomMaybe it's a dream come trueWalking right alongside of youWish I could tell you how much I careBut I only have the nerve to stareI can feel a something pounding in my brainJust any time that someone speaks your nameTrumpets sound and I hear thunder boomEvery time that you walk in the roomEvery time that you walk in the room
