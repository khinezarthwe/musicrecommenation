Oh, my life is changing every day In every possible way And oh, my dreams... It's never quite as it seems Never quite as it seems I know I felt like this before Now I'm feeling it even more Because it came from you Then I open up and see The person falling here is me A different way to be I want more, impossible to ignore Impossible to ignore And they'll come true, impossible not to do Impossible not to do And now I tell you openly You have my heart, so don't hurt me You're what I couldn't find A totally amazing mind So understanding and so kind You're everything to me Oh, my life is changing every day In every possible way And oh my dreams... It's never quite as it seems' Cause you're a dream to me Dream to me
