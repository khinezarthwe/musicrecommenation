If I fell in love with youWould you promise to be trueAnd help me understand'Cause I've been in love beforeAnd I've found that love was moreThan just holding handsIf I give my heart to youI must be sure from the very startThat you would love me more than herIf I trust in you, oh pleaseDon't run and hide,If I love you too, oh pleaseDon't hurt my pride like her'Cause I couldn't stand the painAnd I would be sadIf our new love was in vainSo I hope you see that IWould love to love youIf I fell in love with you
