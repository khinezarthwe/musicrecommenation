Queen Bodecia is long dead and goneStill then the spirit in her children's children's children it lives onBut if you've lost your faith in love and musicOh, the end wont be longBecause if it's gone for you, then I too may lose itAnd that would be wrongTried so hard to keep myself from fallingBack into my bad old waysAnd it chars my heart to always hear you callingCalling for the good old days'Cause there were no "good old days"These are the good old daysAnd it's not about tenements and needlesAnd all the evils in their eyes and the backs of their mindsDaisy chains and school-yard gamesA list of things we said we'd do tomorrowList of things we said we'd do tomorrowThe arcadian dream, so fallen throughBut the Albion sails on courseLet's man the decks and hoist the riggingBecause the pig man's found the sourceAnd there's twelve rude boys on the oarsRow, row, row
