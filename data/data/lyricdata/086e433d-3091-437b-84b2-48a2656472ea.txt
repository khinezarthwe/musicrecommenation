Monday has come around againI'm in the same old placeWith the same old faces always watching meWho knows how long I'll have to stayCould be a hundred yearsOf sweat and tearsAt the rate that I get paidSometimes I slowly drift awayFrom all the dull routineThat's with me every dayA fantasy will come to meDiamonds are what I really needThink I'll rob a store, escape the lawAnd live in ItalyLately my luck has been so badYou know the roulette wheel'sA crooked dealI'm losing all I hadSoon be like a man that's on the runAnd live from day to dayNever needing anyonePlay hide and seekThroughout the weekMy life is full of romanceGuess I'll always have to beLiving in a fantasyThat's the way it's got to beFrom now onYou think I'm crazy I can seeIt's you for you, and me for meLiving in a fantasyFrom now on
