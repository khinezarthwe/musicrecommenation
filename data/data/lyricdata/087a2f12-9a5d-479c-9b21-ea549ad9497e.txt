I live for you I die for you Do what you want me to I cry for you My tears will show That I can't let you go It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet You still want me, don't you? It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet Cause I can see through you It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet You still want me, don't you? It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet Don't let me down Don't make a sound Don't throw it all away Remember me so tenderly Don't let it slip away It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet You still want me, don't you? It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet Cause I can see through you It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet You still want me, don't you? It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet You still want me, don't you? It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet Cause I can see through you It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet You still want me, don't you? It's not over, not over, not over, not over yet
