Baby do you know what you did todayBaby do you know what you took awayYou took the blue out of the skyMy whole life changed when you said goodbyeAn' I keep crying, cryingOoooh babyOoooh babyI wish I never saw the sunshineI wish I never saw the sunshineAn' if I never saw the sunshine babyThen maybe I wouldn't mind the rainEvery day is just like the day beforeAll alone a million miles from shoreAll of my dreams I dreamed with youNow they will die and never come trueAn' I keep crying, cryingOoooh babyOoooh babyI wish I never saw the sunshineI wish I never saw the sunshineAn' if I never saw the sunshine babyThen maybe I wouldn't mind the rainOoooh this painAnd I know there would not beThis cloud that's over meEverywhere I goOoooh babyOoooh babyI wish I never saw the sunshineI wish I never saw the sunshineAn' if I never saw the sunshine babyThen maybe I wouldn't mind the rainOoooh this painI wouldn't mind the rainThere wouldn't be this painI wouldn't mind the rainI wouldn't mind the rain
