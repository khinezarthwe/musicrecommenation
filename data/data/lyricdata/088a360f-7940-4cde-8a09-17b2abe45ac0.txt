When I step into the lightMy arms are open wideWhen I step into the lightMy eyes searching wildlyWould you not like to beSitting on top of the world withyour legs hanging freeWould you not like to be ok, ok, ok?When I'm walking by the waterSplish splash me and you takin a bathWhen I'm walking by the waterCome up through my toesTo my anklesTo my headTo my soulI'm blown awayWhen I'm walking by the waterSplish splash me and you takin a bathWhen I'm walking by the waterCome up through my toesTo my anklesTo my headTo my soulI'm blown away(various talking and laughter)I can't believe that we wouldlie in our gravesWondering if we hadspent our living days wellI can't believe that we wouldlie in our gravesDreaming of things that wemight have beenI can't believe that we wouldlie in our gravesWondering if we hadspent our living days wellI can't believe that we wouldlie in our gravesDreaming of things that wemight have beenWould you not like to beI can't believe that youwould not like to beWould you not like to beok, ok, ok
