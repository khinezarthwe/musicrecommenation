When I step into the light My arms are open wide When I step into the light My eyes searching wildly Would you not like to be Sitting on top of the world withyour legs hanging free Would you not like to be ok, ok, ok? When I'm walking by the water Splish splash me and you takin a bath When I'm walking by the water Come up through my toes To my ankles To my head To my soul I'm blown away When I'm walking by the water Splish splash me and you takin a bath When I'm walking by the water Come up through my toes To my ankles To my head To my soul I'm blown away(various talking and laughter) I can't believe that we wouldlie in our graves Wondering if we hadspent our living days well I can't believe that we wouldlie in our graves Dreaming of things that wemight have been I can't believe that we wouldlie in our graves Wondering if we hadspent our living days well I can't believe that we wouldlie in our graves Dreaming of things that wemight have been Would you not like to be I can't believe that youwould not like to be Would you not like to beok, ok, ok
