Have mercy on me, sir,Allow me to impose on you;I have no place to stay and my bones are cold right throughI will tell you a story of a man and his family,And I swear that it is trueTen years ago I met a girl named Joy:She was a sweet and happy thing;Her eyes were bright blue jewelsAnd we were married in the springI had no idea what happiness a little love could bring,Or what life had in store...But all things move toward their end,All things move toward their end —On that you can be sureHit it! Mmm...Then one morning I woke to find her weeping and for many days to followShe grew so sad and lonely;Became Joy in name onlyWithin her breast there launched an unnamed sorrow and a dark and grim force set sail"Farewell happy fields,Where joy forever dwells,Hail, horrors, hail!"Was it an act of contrition, or some awful premonition?As if she saw into of her final blood-soaked night;Those lunatic eyes,That hungry kitchen knifeAh, I see, sir, that I have your attention!Well, could it be?How often have I asked that question?Well, then in quick succession we had babies, one, two, threeWe called them Hilda, Hattie and Holly;They were their mother's children:Their eyes were bright blue jewels and they were quiet as a mouse,There was no laughter in the house,No, not from Hilda, Hattie or Holly"No wonder", people said, "poor mother Joy's so melancholy"Well, one night, there came a visitor to our little homeI was visiting a sick friend;I was a doctor then;Joy and the girls were on their ownYeah... Oh yeah...Joy had been bound with electrical tape,In her mouth a gag;She'd been stabbed repeatedly and stuffed into a sleeping bagIn their very cots my girls were robbed of their livesMethod of murder much the same way as my wife'sMethod of murder much the same way as my wife'sIt was midnight when I arrived homeSaid to the police on the telephone"Someone's taken four innocent lives!"They never caught the man;He's still on the loose.It seems he's done many, many moreQuotes John Milton on the walls in the victim's bloodThe police are investigating at tremendous costIn my house he wrote, ""That, I'm told, is from Paradise LostThe wind round here gets wicked coldBut my story is nearly told;I fear the morning will bring quite a frostSo I've left my homeI drift from land to landI am upon your step and you are a family man —Outside, the vultures wheel,The wolves howl,The serpents hiss,And to extend this small favor, friend, would be the sum of earthly blissDo you reckon me a friend?The sun to me is dark and silent as the moon —Do you, sir, have a room?Are you beckoning me in?Hit it![]]
