I thought it was funny when you, missed the trainWhen I rang you at home, they said you'd left, yesterdayI thought it was strange when your, car was foundBy the tree in Ennis where we used to hang aroundDear Isobel, I hope you're well, and what you've done is right,Oh it's been such hell, I wish you well, I hope you're safe tonightIt's been a long day coming and long will it lastWhen it's last day leaving, and I'm helping it passBy loving you moreAnd who would he become, all the things he'd have doneWould he have loved you, and not let you down?And would he be stronger than his father?Don't punish yourself; leave it well aloneDear Isobel, I hope you're well, and what you've done is right,Oh it's been such hell, I wish you well, I hope you're safe tonightIt's been a long day coming and long will it lastWhen it's last day leaving, and I'm helping it passBy loving you more
