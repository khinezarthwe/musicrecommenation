Come up crash with the musesFells dust into ashCome so close that I might seeThe light inside me I might seeLet me hold you tight and armsTight and arms you lost your chanceCome so close that I might seeThe crash of light come down on meWith good luck I'll findThe dark stop me nowFind me to your heartLet me hold you tightLike rain and sunshine on a rainy daySee the lightsCome so close that I might seeSee the light come down on meSearching like the fresh goes by smallLike wind refuse to dieFree me now so I can seeThe taste of wind who lock meDoes the wind indeed like meDoes the wind indeed like meWith good luck I find the dark stop me nowFind me to your heartLet me hold you tightLike rain and sunshine on a rainy dayLet me hold you tight and armsTight and arms you lost your chanceCome so close that I might seeThe crash of light come down on meThe crash of light come down on meThe crash of light come down on meLet me hold you tight and armsTight and arms you lost your chanceCome so close that I might seeThe crash of light come down on meWith spin luck I'll find the darkStop me now find me to your heartThe crash of light come down on meSo tonight the crash goes bySmall like wind and refuse to dieThe crash of light come down on meCome so close that I might seeSee the light come down on meI hold you tight like rainSunshine on a rainy daySunshine on a rainy day
