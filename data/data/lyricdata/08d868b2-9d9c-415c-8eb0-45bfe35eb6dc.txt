TeignmouthOn the night trainFrom the city to the southI saw spiritsCrawl across the river mouthIn skewed ascensionWith no destinationLike this lone bachelor in meThis constant yearningFor great love and learningFor the wind to carry me freeSo when the birds fly southI'll Reach up and hold their tailsPull up and out of hereAnd bridle the autumn galesDown to the burning cliffsTo the everlasting rollTo marry the untold blissesAnd anchor this lost soulFrom my windowI saw two birds lost at seaI caught our reflectionIn that silent tragedyBut with hope prevailingI draw galleons sailingIn full sail billowing freeSo when the birds fly southWe'll reach up and hold their tailsPull up and out of hereAnd bridle the autumn galesI give you my handThe fingers unfoldTo have and forever holdTo marry the untold blissesAnd anchor this lost soul
