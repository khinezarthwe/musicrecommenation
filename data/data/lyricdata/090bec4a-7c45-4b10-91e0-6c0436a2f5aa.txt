Oh, well it's hard to look deep into your soul.Not everything you'll find will be perfect gold.There are ghosts and demons that hide in the dark.Oh, they wait till I find love and then they laugh.Oh, they know that my body is no way good enough.Know that my heart is no way strong enough to bare the sorrow that love brings.Oh, when I coil in fear, oh, the demons sing.But it's a hollow love for a heart with no blood;In its veins.Oh, there is no endless devotion,that is free from the force of erosion.Oh, if you don't believe in God,how can you believe in life?When we're all just matter that will one day scatter,when peaceful, the world lays us down.Oh, and finding love is a matter of luck.Oh, and unsettled lovers move from fuck to fuck.Oh, and compare their achievements like dicussing berevments.And compare their abrasions with romantic quotations,Oh, as peaceful, the world watches down.You were blown out of the water.Oh, and we walk on the feet we have grown.Oh we were given a heart, of which love was a part.Oh, and we cornered the thing from which all life will spring.And it gave value to the world that surrounds us.But we consider the world just for a moment,Oh, and it's gone before we even know.Oh, but I'll follow it 'round,Yeah, I'll follow it 'round.Oh, I'll follow it 'round,Yeah, I'll follow it 'round.'Till peaceful, the world lays me down.
