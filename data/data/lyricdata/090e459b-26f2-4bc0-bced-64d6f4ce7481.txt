Been natural For once in my life Now I'll have to Swallow some pride Know that I should Never give advice But it's too late now to say goodbye Be natural Don't want any friends Be natural Come on and hit me again Be natural I'm repeating myself Be natural Is there anything else Star, bright Keep me safe Today and tonight No water tastes like lemonade Slowly, slowly It starts to fade Be natural With me tonight Be natural Put your fists in my eyes Be natural So turn me into stone Be natural, just leave me alone Grown up or backwards-born Into eternity And black holes Floating around up here on my own Screaming at me Forever unknown Be natural Be natural Be natural Been natural, is there anyone else?
