Walking up the hill tonightAnd you have closed your eyesI wish I didn't have to makeAll those mistakes and be wiseBut please try to be patientI know that I'm still learningI'm sorry that you have to seeThe strength inside me burningWhere are you my angel now?Don't you see me crying?And I know that you can't do it allBut you can't say I'm not tryingI'm on my knees in front of himBut he doesn't seem to see meBut all his troubles on his mindHe's looking right through meAnd I'm letting myself downBy satisfying youAnd I wish that you could seeI have my troubles tooLooking at you sleepingI'm with a man I knowI'm sitting here weepingWhile the hours pass so slowAnd I know that in the morningI'll have to let you goAnd you'll be just a manOnce I used to knowBut for these past few daysSomeone I don't recognizeThis isn't all my faultWhen will you realize?Looking at you leavingI'm looking for a sign
