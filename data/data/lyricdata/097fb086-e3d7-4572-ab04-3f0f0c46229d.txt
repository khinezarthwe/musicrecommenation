It's the disease of the age It's the disease that we crave Alone at the end of the rave We catch the last bus home Corporate America wakes Coffee republic and cakes We open the latch on the gate Of the hole that we call our home Protect me from what I want Protect me from what I want Protect me from what I want Protect me protect me Maybe we're victims of fate Remember when we'd celebrate We'd drink and get high until late And now we're all alone Wedding bells ain't gonna chime With both of us guilty of crime And both of us sentenced to time And now we're all alone Protect me from what I want Protect me from what I want Protect me from what I want Protect me protect me Protect me from what I want Protect me from what I want Protect me from what I want Protect me protect me Protect me from what I want Protect me from what I want Protect me from what I want Protect me protect me Protect me from what I want Protect me from what I want Protect me from what I want Protect me protect me Protect me from what I want Protect me from what I want Protect me protect me
