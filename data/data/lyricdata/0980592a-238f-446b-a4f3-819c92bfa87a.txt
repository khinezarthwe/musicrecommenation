If I could tear you from the ceilingAnd guarantee a source divineRid you of possessions fleetingRemain your funny valentineDon't go and leave meAnd please don't drive me blindDon't go and leave meAnd please don't drive me blindIf I could tear you from the ceilingI know best have triedI'd fill your every breath with meaningAnd find a place we both could hideDon't go and leave meAnd please don't drive me blindDon't go and leave meAnd please don't drive me blindYou don't believe meBut you do this every timePlease don't drive me blindPlease don't drive me blindI know you're brokenI know you're brokenI know you're brokenIf I could tear you from the ceilingI'd freeze us both in timeAnd find a brand new way of seeingYour eyes forever glued to mineDon't go and leave meAnd please don't drive me blindDon't go and leave meAnd please don't drive me blindPlease don't drive me blindPlease don't drive me blindPlease don't drive me blindPlease don't drive me blind
