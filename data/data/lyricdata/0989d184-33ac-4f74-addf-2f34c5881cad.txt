It's 5 o'clock in the morning Conversation got boring You said you're going to bed soon So I snuck off to your bedroom And I thought I'd just wait there Until I heard you come up the stairs And I pretended I was sleeping And I was hoping you would creep in With me You put your arm around my shoulder And it was as if the room got colder And we moved closer in together And started talking 'bout the weather You said tomorrow would be fun And we can watch I didn't know where this was going When you kissed me Are you mine? Are you mine?' Cause I stay here all the time Watching telly, drinking wine Who'da known? Who'da known? When you flash up on my phone I no longer feel alone, no longer feel alone I haven't left here for days now And I'm becoming amazed how You're quite affectionate in public In fact, your friend said it made her feel sick And even though it's moving forward There's just the right amount of awkward And today you accidentally Called me baby Are you mine? Are you mine?' Cause I stay here all the time Watching telly, drinking wine Who'da known? Who'da known? When you flash up on my phone I no longer feel alone Let's just stay, let's just stay I wanna lie in bed all day We'll be laughing all the way Told your friends, they all know We exist but we're taking it slow Now let's just see how we go Now let's see how we go Let's just stay, let's just stay I wanna lie in bed all day We'll be laughing all the way Told your friends, they all know We exist, but we're taking it slow Now let's just see how we go Let's see how we go
