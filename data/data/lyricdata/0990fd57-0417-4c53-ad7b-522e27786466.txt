The bats are in the belfryThe dew is on the moorWhere are the arms that held meAnd pledged her love beforeAnd pledged her love beforeAnd it's such a sad old feelingAll the fields are soft and greenIt's memories that I'm stealingBut you're innocent when you dreamWhen you dreamYou're innocent when you dreamWhen you dreamYou're innocent when you dreamI made a golden promiseThat we would never partI gave my love a locketAnd then I broke her heartAnd then I broke her heartAnd it's such a sad old feelingAll of the fields are soft and greenAnd it's memories that I'm stealingBut you're innocent when you dreamWhen you dreamYou're innocent when you dreamWhen you dreamYou're innocent when you dreamWe've running through the graveyardAnd we laughed, my friends and IWe swore we'd be togetherUntil the day we diedUntil the day we diedIt's such a sad old feelingAll of the fields are soft and greenAnd it's memories that I'm stealingBut you're innocent when you dreamWhen you dreamYou're innocent when you dreamWhen you dreamYou're innocent when you dreamAnd it's such a sad old feelingThe fields are soft and greenAnd it's memories that I'm stealingBut you're innocent when you dreamWhen you dreamYou're innocent when you dreamWhen you dreamYou're innocent when you dream
