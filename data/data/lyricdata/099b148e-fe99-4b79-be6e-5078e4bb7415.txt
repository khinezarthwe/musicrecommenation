It must be the colorsAnd the kidsThat keep me alive'Cause the music is boring me to deathIt must just be the colorsAnd the kids that keep me alive'Cause I wanna go ride awayTo a January nightBuilt a shack with an old friendHe was someone I could learn fromSomeone I could becomeWill you meet me downOn a sandy beachWe can roll up our jeansSo the tide won't get us below the kneesYellow hairYou are a funny bearYellow hairYou are such a funny bearSlender fingersWould hold me slender limbs would hold meAnd you could say my nameLike you knew my nameI could stay hereBecome someone differentI could stay hereBecome someone betterIt's so hard to go in the city'Cause you wanna say hello to everybodyIt's so hard to go into the city'Cause you wanna say hey I love you to everybodyWhen we were teenagers we wanted to be the skyNow all we wanna do is go to red placesAnd try to stay outta hellIt must be the colorsAnd the kidsThat keep me alive'Cause the music is boring me to deathit must just be the colorsAnd it must just be the kidsThat keep me alive on this January night.Yellow hairYou are a funny bearYellow hairYou are such a funny bear
