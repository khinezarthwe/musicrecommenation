As I shit, I sit and wonder whyMy floor is so cold and my back broken tiredBut life is good, even though it won't be longWith a candle comes emotions thatDance with the shadows on my wallWhat were your thoughts, as theyWere flying through your mindCompared to what you feel fromThe bars you're now behindIf they could speak, what do you thinkThey would say to you?I do believe you'd been betterOff if you'd just told the truthNever had a problem till I stood face to face with meAnd I wish there was a way for me to go inside so I could seeAll the faces of the people who have torn a piece of meAs I grew from a seed to a treeCan you feel the power of the eyeThat's hidden away 5 feet from where we lieWhat do you taste, when you take a drink of meIs it too much for me to ask if I asked you to leavePlease just leave 'cause I want to be aloneThere's a fine line between love and my feelings for youHigh time I washed it all awayUnkind, I watch your future burn before youDenied, a chance of any love in your lifeAnd I ask you one time..Why?
