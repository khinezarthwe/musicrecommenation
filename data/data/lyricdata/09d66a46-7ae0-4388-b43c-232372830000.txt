Wake up, take your pills dear I know this time of year ain't right for you You came with a sickness Shot down back in Christmas - Kamikaze rain And I'm sure you've lost that weight again And I'm sure the pills keeping pouring in Like smoke that falls, caving into you So put me on a plane, fly me to anywhere Put me on a plane, fly me to anywhere Put me on a plane, fly me to anywhere With you With you One night, when you woke up You bled till you spoke up, " Oh, this ain't pretty dear." With clocks, watch the time go Till spring, when the sun can finally be free And I'm sure you've lost that weight again And I'm sure the pills keeping pouring in And I'll scream at night to make them go away So put me on a plane, fly me to anywhere Put me on a plane, fly me to anywhere So put me on a plane, fly me to anywhere With you With you With you We'll scream at night to make them go away So put me on a plane, fly me to anywhere Put me on a plane, fly me to anywhere Put me on a plane, fly me to anywhere With you With you With you With you
