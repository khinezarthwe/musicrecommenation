Wake up, take your pills dearI know this time of year ain't right for youYou came with a sicknessShot down back in Christmas - Kamikaze rainAnd I'm sure you've lost that weight againAnd I'm sure the pills keeping pouring inLike smoke that falls, caving into youSo put me on a plane, fly me to anywherePut me on a plane, fly me to anywherePut me on a plane, fly me to anywhereWith youWith youOne night, when you woke upYou bled till you spoke up, "Oh, this ain't pretty dear."With clocks, watch the time goTill spring, when the sun can finally be freeAnd I'm sure you've lost that weight againAnd I'm sure the pills keeping pouring inAnd I'll scream at night to make them go awaySo put me on a plane, fly me to anywherePut me on a plane, fly me to anywhereSo put me on a plane, fly me to anywhereWith youWith youWith youWe'll scream at night to make them go awaySo put me on a plane, fly me to anywherePut me on a plane, fly me to anywherePut me on a plane, fly me to anywhereWith youWith youWith youWith you
