Trudging slowly over wet sand,Back to the bench where your clothes were stolenThis is the coastal town,That they forgot to close downArmageddon, come ArmageddonCome Armageddon, comeEveryday is like Sunday,Everyday is silent and greyHide on the promenade, etch a postcard:"How I dearly wish I was not here"In this seaside town,That they forgot to bombCome, come, come nuclear bombEveryday is like Sunday,Everyday is silent and grey.Trudging back over pebbles and sand,And a strange dust lands on your hands,And on your face,On your face, on your face, on your face...Everyday is like Sunday"Win Yourself A Cheap Tray"Share some grease-tea with meEveryday is silent and grey.
