Airplanes take you away againAre you flying above where we live?Then I look up a glare in my eyesAre you having regrets about last night?I'm not but I like rivers that rush inSo then I dove inIs there trouble ahead for you the acrobatI won't push you unless you have a netYou say the word you know I will find youOr if you need some time I don't mindI don't hold onto the tail of your kiteI'm not like the girls that you've knownBut I believe I'm worth coming home to kiss away nightThis girl only sleeps with butterfliesWith butterfliesSo go on and fly then, boyBalloons look good from on the groundI fear with pins and needles aroundWe may fall then stumble upon a carouselIt could take us anywhereYou say the word you know I will find youOr if you need some time I don't mindI won't hold onto the tail of your kiteI'm not like the girls that you've knownBut I believe I'm worth coming home to kiss away nightThis girlThis girlYou say the word you know I will find youOr if you need some time I don't mindI won't hold onto the tail of your kiteI'm not like the girls that you've knownBut I believe I'm worth coming home to kiss away nightThis girl only sleeps with butterfliesWith butterfliesWith butterfliesSo go on and fly, boy
