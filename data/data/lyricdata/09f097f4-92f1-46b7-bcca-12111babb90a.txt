Daybreak:A September sun emerges through cloudsChasing across the skyThoughts are evoked behind detached eyesBut people are just passing byWith smiles for protectionUnable to see behind the creatureThat he seems to beOnce he was a child with burning desiresWith hopes and dreams of what was to comeSo he's lost some faith but still there are firesDeep inside that he must drench to numbIf we could tryTo share some of his wounds just for a whileBut we're all just people passing byMidday:He's searching through crowdsFor one that is goneRejecting the factsOne more dayTalking too loud to silence the glowColdness becoming his wayEmpathy can't reach through all that blameSmiles now forgotten, locked in their framesNow he's counting timeIn beggings and bottlesFading away beneath old newsSo he lost a war"Will I be dead very long?"He can still hear his voiceThrough the coldnessIf we could try to ease some of his pain just for a whileBut we're all just people passing by(Instrumental)Once he was strong and filled with visionsWith life ahead he set his aimsThen things went wrongNow his ambitions have turned to smilesConserved in framesStill could be strongCould be a prophetHe would teach truth to every manHe'd see the light through every shadowBut Entropia denies he canHe's sitting numb while dusk is fallingAlone he whispers his "goodnight"Turning away, when sleep is callingFrom all the people passing by
