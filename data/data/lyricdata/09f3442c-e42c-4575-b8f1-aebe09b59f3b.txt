I'm a wheel, I'm a wheelI can roll, I can feelAnd you can't stop me turning'Cause I'm the sun, I'm the sunI can move, I can runBut you'll never stop me burningCome down with fireAnd lift my spirit higherSomeone's screaming my nameCome and make me holy againI'm the man on the silver mountainI'm the man on the silver mountainI'm the day, I'm the dayI can show you the wayAnd look, I'm right beside youI'm the night, I'm the nightI'm the dark and the lightWith eyes that see inside youCome down with fireAnd lift my spirit higherSomeone's screaming my nameCome and make me holy againI'm the man on the silver mountainI'm the man on the silver mountainCome down with fireAnd lift my spirit higherSomeone's screaming my nameCome and make me holy againI'm the man on the silver mountainI'm the man on the silver mountainWell, I can help you, you know I canI'm the man on the silver mountainI'm the man on the silver mountainJust look at me and listenI'm the man, the man, give you my handI'm the man on the silver mountainComing down with fireI'll lift your spirit higherI'm the man on the mountainThe man on the silver mountainI'm the night, the lightThe black and the whiteThe man on the silver mountainI'm the man on the silver mountain
