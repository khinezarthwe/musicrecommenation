Storm, cast me out So I can feel it in another way I won't talk about Warm passenger's high If I can feed it for another day It might run me dry I know the seasons evolved to a freeze Putting hearts in the balance here It's up to your knees and it's shifting Degrees and it's choking your atmosphere Storm, wind me out So I can feel it in another way They won't talk about Worn, masochist's sigh A distant figure in a photograph Another eye I know your reason is stalled And your freedom's dissolved in your passion dear It's burning your eyes and it's killing your mind And it's broken your atmosphere But should you find it obscene in that grey Old dramatics hear a young heart say Lord, if you got lungs C'mon shout me out I know the freeze has unthawed And it's putting your love into action dear It's off in the breeze and it's shifting degrees And it's opened your atmosphere So should you decide it's obscene in that grey Old dramatics hear a young heart say Lord, if you got lungs C'mon shout me out
