Lift me up on my honourTake me over this spellGet this weight off my shouldersI've carried it wellLose these shackles of pressureShake me out of these chainsLead me not to temptationHold my hand harderEase my mindRoll down the smokescreenAnd open the skyLet me flyMan, I need a release fromThis troublesome mindFix my feet when they're stumblingAnd well, you know, it hurts sometimesYou know it's gonna bleed sometimesDig me out from this thorn treeHelp me bury my shameKeep my eyes from the fireThey can't handle the flameGrace cut out from my brothersWhen most of them fellI carried it wellLet me flyMan, I need a release fromThis troublesome mindFix my feet when they're stumblingI guess you know it hurts sometimesYou know it's gonna bleed sometimesNow hold onI'm not looking for sweet talkI'm looking for timeTime for tower and sleep walkBrother, 'cause it hurts sometimesYou know it's gonna bleed sometimesHold onYou know it's gonna hurt sometimesWhen you call me, hold onHold onHold onI'm gonna climb that symphony home and make it mineLet his resonance light my waySee, all these pessimistic sufferers tend to drag me downSo I could use it to shelter what good I've found
