You always want me to be a part of youYou always taught me to be alive with youThis is the time and the place and the momentFeeling the way that I doThese are the signs and the traces of growingBy living the way that I doI hope you understand and acknowledgeAll that's passing throughIt's constantly been there andThrowing all that wasn't goodI hope we both find the placeWhere maybe some day we will find our strengthAnd hopefully attain to finally escapeI'm always amazed how we're so self destructiveDoes any body know why?Find the light
