You always want me to be a part of you You always taught me to be alive with you This is the time and the place and the moment Feeling the way that I do These are the signs and the traces of growing By living the way that I do I hope you understand and acknowledge All that's passing through It's constantly been there and Throwing all that wasn't good I hope we both find the place Where maybe some day we will find our strength And hopefully attain to finally escape I'm always amazed how we're so self destructive Does any body know why? Find the light
