Grey skies and light fadingHeadlamps making patterns on the wallUptown is dead now butOut here no one seems to care at allSlick girls and sick boys andEach one lining up to take you homeThey hold tight, they're corneredThey pray no one has to see them fallI'm there, yeah, I serve themThe one with the empty-looking eyesCome closer, you'll see meThe face that is used to telling liesSaturday nights in neon lightSunday in the sandPills enough to make me feel illCash enough to make me wellTake me, take me to the riotTake me, take me to the riotTake me, take me to the riotTake me, take me to the riotTake meYou sprung me, I'm gratefulI love when you tell me not to speakI owe you, but I know youYou'll have me back, but it's gonna take a weekWhat now, kid? Which way, love?Will we ever make up and be friends?Good news is my shoes isLined with all my nickels and my tensLet's do them, just feed meI hate when I have to get to sleepYou despise me, and I love youIt's not much, but it's just enough to keepSaturday nights in neon lightSunday in the sandPills enough to make me feel illCash enough to make me wellTake me, take me to the riotTake me, take me to the riotTake me, take me to the riotTake me, take me to the riotAnd let me stayAnd let me stayLet me stayLet me, let me stay
