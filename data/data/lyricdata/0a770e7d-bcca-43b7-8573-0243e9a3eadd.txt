Taking timeto walk down all the aisles. Turning over every stone. Building new rulersbut still haven't burnt any old. Please don't let me down this time. I've come a long way to just fold back into line. Keep both feet on the groundwhile I change the wings. I promise one day I'll be coming aroundfrom my cloud to see what it's all about. But please don't let me down this time. I've come a long way to just fold back into line. Please hold me backif I tend to lose it and steer into old tracks. Please don't let me down this time. I've come a long way to just fold back into line.
