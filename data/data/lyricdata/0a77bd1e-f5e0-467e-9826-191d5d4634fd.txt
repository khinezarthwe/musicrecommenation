My sweet roseAs the two of us growI want you to know that nothing's quite as badAs it seems when you're so sadSo remember my rose, remember my roseMy sweet roseI'd like to sayI'd like to say no one always gets their wayAnd no one always thinks the sameMy rose, remember my roseWhen the seasons changeAnd the sky turns greyWhen the leaves turn brownI'll be aroundMy sweet roseAs the two of us changeI want you to know that nothing stays the sameBut you and I, we will remainMy rose, remember my roseWhen the seasons changeAnd the sky turns greyWhen the leaves turn brownI'll be aroundI want you to know that nothing stays the sameBut you and I, we will remainMy rose, remember my rose
