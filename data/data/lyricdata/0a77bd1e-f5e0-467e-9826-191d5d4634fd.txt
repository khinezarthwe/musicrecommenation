My sweet rose As the two of us grow I want you to know that nothing's quite as bad As it seems when you're so sad So remember my rose, remember my rose My sweet rose I'd like to say I'd like to say no one always gets their way And no one always thinks the same My rose, remember my rose When the seasons change And the sky turns grey When the leaves turn brown I'll be around My sweet rose As the two of us change I want you to know that nothing stays the same But you and I, we will remain My rose, remember my rose When the seasons change And the sky turns grey When the leaves turn brown I'll be around I want you to know that nothing stays the same But you and I, we will remain My rose, remember my rose
