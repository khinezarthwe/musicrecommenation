A witch will burnWhen she's thrown into the fireNot her she'll peel and writheBut never expireShe crawls on webs of liesI die up inside herTo take what's mineThat bitch, the cinnamon spiderI won't tryAnd I everytime I tell that lie, I live without guiltAnd I won't cryAnd I hope you love your lifeAnd live with your guiltConsumed by hate and guiltShe'll never retireToo old to fixToo dead to ever acquireSlit wrists- talk shitBut she will never inspire a plan to save herselfThe cinnamon spiderI won't tryAnd everytime I tell that lie, I live without guiltAnd I won't cryAnd I hope you love your lifeAnd live with your guiltBit heads off those who fail and try to imply herForlorn dispisedI am the cinnamon spiderI won't tryAnd everytime I tell that lie, I live without guiltAnd I won't cryAnd I hope you love your lifeAnd live with your guiltAnd I am fineAnd I'll learn to take what's mineAnd live without guiltOh yeah
