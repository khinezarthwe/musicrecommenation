A witch will burn When she's thrown into the fire Not her she'll peel and writhe But never expire She crawls on webs of lies I die up inside her To take what's mine That bitch, the cinnamon spider I won't try And I everytime I tell that lie, I live without guilt And I won't cry And I hope you love your life And live with your guilt Consumed by hate and guilt She'll never retire Too old to fix Too dead to ever acquire Slit wrists- talk shit But she will never inspire a plan to save herself The cinnamon spider I won't try And everytime I tell that lie, I live without guilt And I won't cry And I hope you love your life And live with your guilt Bit heads off those who fail and try to imply her Forlorn dispised I am the cinnamon spider I won't try And everytime I tell that lie, I live without guilt And I won't cry And I hope you love your life And live with your guilt And I am fine And I'll learn to take what's mine And live without guilt Oh yeah
