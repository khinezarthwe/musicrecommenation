There's a light when my baby is in my armsThere's a light when the window shades are drawnHesitate when I feel I may do harm to herWash it off, 'cause this feeling we can shareAnd I know she's reached my heart in thin airByzantine is reflected in our pondThere's a cloud, but the water remains calmReaching in, the sun's fingers clutch the dawn to passEven out, it's a precious thing to bearAnd I know she's reached my heart in thin airYes, I know she's reached my heart in thin airIt's not in my past to presumeLove can keep on moving in both directionsHow to be happy and trueIs the quest we're taking on togetherTaking on, on, on, on, onTaking on, on, on, on, onThere's a light when my baby's in my armsAnd I know she's reached my heart in thin airAnd I know she's reached my heart in thin airAnd I know she's reached my heart in thin airYes, I know she's reached my heart
