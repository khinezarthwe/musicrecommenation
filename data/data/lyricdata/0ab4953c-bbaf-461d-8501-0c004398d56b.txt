Just like the way that you ran to wineWhen they made the new milk turnJesus, a friend in the better timesLet your mother's bible burnFreedom, a fever you suffered throughAnd the dog drank from your cupFrozen, the river that baptized youAnd the horse died standing upBut when a southern anthem ringsShe will buckle to that soundWhen that southern anthem singsIt will lay her burdens downJust like the way you lost your gunsWhen they cut the clothesline looseJesus, a friend of the weaker onesSaid,Freedom, a thistle that withered dryStill a baby in your handsFrozen, the ground refused to dieAnd the guitar rose againBut when that southern anthem ringsShe will buckle to the soundWhen that southern anthem singsIt will lay her burdens down
