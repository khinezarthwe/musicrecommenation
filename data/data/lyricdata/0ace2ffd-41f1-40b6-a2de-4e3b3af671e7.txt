Interpretation of early black and white Haitian love songs Oceans wept Mountains slept Sidewalks crumbled to ash Your name remains In children's lullabies And your eyes forever in the sky Pull me close Dear I'm tremblin' Hold me tight I'm afraid ot the night Blackness fills the room Your love, it burns bright Oh, summer winds Remind me of your kiss Soft and warm I never want to leave this I never wanted to say goodbye I'd throw myself to the sea If God promised you're inside We'd float to island paradise And I'd become your bride The countryside looks bare Without you lying in her grass The stream is dry And the crickets are silent There's no music in the night I'd breathe my last breath To mingle with your sigh I'd become smoke And hide in your cigarette pack To be a star Tossing light To sparkle in your eyes I'd become an angel And kiss this earth goodbye Destiny Used to be Just a word to me But heaven sure was right When they said Jesus left somethin' behind Every inch of this body I'd plate in gold for you Even though I ain't go no money I'd do it just to keep you Your eyes appear In every one of my dreams They glitter and they gleam Like the first time we meet The chickens, they crowed And I knowed you're home Oh, my spirit ran to greet you Before my feet left the porch Interpretation of early black and white Haitian love songs
