Interpretation of early black and white Haitian love songsOceans weptMountains sleptSidewalks crumbled to ashYour name remainsIn children's lullabiesAnd your eyes forever in the skyPull me closeDear I'm tremblin'Hold me tightI'm afraid ot the nightBlackness fills the roomYour love, it burns brightOh, summer windsRemind me of your kissSoft and warmI never want to leave thisI never wanted to say goodbyeI'd throw myself to the seaIf God promised you're insideWe'd float to island paradiseAnd I'd become your brideThe countryside looks bareWithout you lying in her grassThe stream is dryAnd the crickets are silentThere's no music in the nightI'd breathe my last breathTo mingle with your sighI'd become smokeAnd hide in your cigarette packTo be a starTossing lightTo sparkle in your eyesI'd become an angelAnd kiss this earth goodbyeDestinyUsed to beJust a word to meBut heaven sure was rightWhen they said Jesus left somethin' behindEvery inch of this bodyI'd plate in gold for youEven though I ain't go no moneyI'd do it just to keep youYour eyes appearIn every one of my dreamsThey glitter and they gleamLike the first time we meetThe chickens, they crowedAnd I knowed you're homeOh, my spirit ran to greet youBefore my feet left the porchInterpretation of early black and white Haitian love songs
