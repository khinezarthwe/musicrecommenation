One and one and one is twoAll this and more you said was trueAnd if you'd left me ground to stand onI'd run so far away from youWhat do you do with a remainder?You round it up or round it downAnd if you're scared by what you're left withDestroy the answer that you've foundYou were the oneWhen the day had begunThe sun was shining on usBlinding me suchThat I couldn't seeThere was a hole beneath meAnd then you watched me fallWith no expression at allThere is an absolute zeroBut you won't find it on your ownOnly someone else can show you nothingAnd leave you with a gaping holeYou were the oneWhen the storm rolled inThe sky was grey like your heartWith no color at allI don't know you like thisYou're as reckless as windAnd I couldn't predictJust the way this would end
