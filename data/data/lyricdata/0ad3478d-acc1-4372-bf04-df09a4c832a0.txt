Let the heart restlay back your headyou were good in your timeand we thank you You made me feel less aloneyou made me feel not quite sodeformed, uninformed and hunchback Time takes all breath awayyou were good in your timeand we thank you so You said more in one daythan most people sayin a lifetime, it was our timeand we thank you An end-of-the-ride sighyour soft smile says:"please understand, I must surrender." Then you grip with your handnow so small in mineare you aware wherever you arethat you have just died?
