The night starts here, the night starts here Forget your name, forget your fear The night starts here, the night starts here Forget your name, forget your fear The pleasure part, the afterthought The missing stone in the graveyard The task at hand, the time we had The love it takes to become a man The dust at dawn is rained upon Attaches itself to everyone No one is spared, no one is clean It travels places you've never been or seen before The night starts here, the night starts here Forget your name, forget your fear The night starts here, the night starts here Forget your name, forget your fear You drop a coin into the sea And shout out " Please come back to me!" You name your child after your fear And tell them " I have brought you here" The pleasure part, the aftershock The moment that it takes to fall apart The time we had, the task at hand The love it takes to destroy a man The ecstasy, the being free That big black cloud over you and me And after that, the upwards fall And were we angels, after all? I don't know, I don't know The night starts here, the night starts here Forget your name and forget your fear The night starts here, the night starts here Forget your name and forget your fear You drop a coin into the sea And shout out " Please come back to me!" You name your child after your fear And tell them " I have brought you here" The night starts here (the scary part) The night starts here (the aftershock) Forget your name (the moment that) Forget your fear (it takes to fall apart) The night starts here (the time we had) The night starts here (the task at hand) Forget your name (the love it takes) Forget your fear (to destroy a man) You drop a coin (the ecstasy) Into the sea (the being free) And shout out (that big black cloud)" Please come back to me!" (over you and me) You name your child (and after that) After your fear (the upwards fall) And tell them (and were we angels)" I have brought you here" (after all?) The night starts here ( I don't know) The night starts here ( I don't know) Forget your name Forget your fear The night starts here ( I don't know) The night starts here Forget your name ( I don't know) Forget your fear ( I don't know) You drop a coin into the sea And shout out " Please come back to me!" You name your child after your fear And tell them " I have brought you here"
