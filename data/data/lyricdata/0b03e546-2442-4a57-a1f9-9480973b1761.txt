With every morning chore You look around once more So that your eyes will adjust To all the grain and dust All the time Spent over nothing Seems like you're done You are I was pacing around And just recording it down I had nothing to say I'm done for another day' Cause I don't wanna share you So don't say goodnight Nooo Don't say goodnight It's too dull to pause And to remember the cause It's just to dull to care So we cue from the northern air And the icy edge Will steal our reflections When we pass on by When we pass by
