With every morning choreYou look around once moreSo that your eyes will adjustTo all the grain and dustAll the timeSpent over nothingSeems like you're doneYou areI was pacing aroundAnd just recording it downI had nothing to sayI'm done for another day'Cause I don't wanna share youSo don't say goodnightNoooDon't say goodnightIt's too dull to pauseAnd to remember the causeIt's just to dull to careSo we cue from the northern airAnd the icy edgeWill steal our reflectionsWhen we pass on byWhen we pass by
