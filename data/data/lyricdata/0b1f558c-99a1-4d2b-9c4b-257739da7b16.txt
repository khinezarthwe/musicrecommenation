I still dream of OrgononI wake up cryingYou're making rainAnd you're just in reachWhen you and sleep escape meYou're like my yo-yoThat glowed in the darkWhat made it specialMade it dangerousSo I bury itAnd forgetBut every time it rainsYou're here in my headLike the sun coming outOoh, I just know that something good is gonna happen.And I don't know whenBut just saying it could even make it happenOn top of the worldLooking over the edgeYou could see them comingYou looked too smallIn their big black carTo be a threat to the men in power.I hid my yo-yoIn the garden.I can't hide youFrom the governmentOh, God, DaddyI won't forget'Cause every time it rainsYou're here in my headLike the sun coming outOoh, I just know that something good is gonna happen.And I don't know whenBut just saying it could even make it happenAnd every time it rainsYou're here in my headLike the sun coming outLike your son's coming outOoh, I just know that something good is going to happenAnd I don't know whenBut just saying it could even make it happenOoh, just saying it could even make it happenWe've been cloudbusting daddyThe sun's coming outYour son's coming out
