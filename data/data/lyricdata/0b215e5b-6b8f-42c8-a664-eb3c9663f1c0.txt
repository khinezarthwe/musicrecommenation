I walk down my street at nightThe city lights are cold and violentI am comforted by the approaching sounds of trucks and sirensEven though the world's so badThese men rush out to help the dyingAnd though I am no use to themI do my part by simply smilingThe ghetto boys are catcalling meAs I pull my keys from my pocketI wonder if this method of courtshipHas ever been effectiveHas any girl in history saidSure, you seem so nice, let's get it onStill, I always shock them when I answerHi, my name's AmandaAnd I'm not gonna live my life on one side of an ampersandAnd even if I went with you I'm not the girl you think I amAnd I'm not gonna match youCause I'll lose my voice completely yeahI'm just gonna watch youCause I'm not the one that's crazyYeah...I have wasted years of my lifeAgonizing about the firesI started when I thought that to be strong, you must be flame retardantAnd now to dress the wounds goes into questionHow authentic they areThere is always someone criticizing meShe just likes playing hospitalLying in my bedI remember what you saidThere's no such thing as accidentsBut you've got the headstone all readyAll carved up and prettyYour sick satisfactionThose his and hers matchingThe daisies all push up'nPairs to the horizonsYour eyes full of ketchupIt's nice that you're tryingThe headstone's all readyAll carved up and prettyYour sick satisfactionThose his and hers matchingThe daises all push up'nPairs to the horizonsYour eyes full of ketchupIt's nice that you're tryingAnd I'm not gonna live my life on one side of an ampersandAnd even if I went with you, I'm not the girl you think I amAnd I'm not gonna match youCause I'll lose my voice completelyNo, I'm not gonna watch youCause I'm not the one that's crazyYeah...I'm not the one that's crazyYeah...As I wake up to a clockThe fire burned the blockBut ironically stopped at my apartmentAnd my housemates are all sleeping soundlyAnd nobody deserves to dieBut you were awful adamantThat if I didn't love youThen you have just one alternativeAnd I may be romanticAnd I may risk my life for itBut I ain't gonna die for youYou know I ain't no JulietAnd I'm not gonna watch you wanna burn yourself out babyNo I'm not gonna stop youCause I'm not the one that's crazy, yeahI'm not the one that's crazy, yeahI'm not the one that's crazy...
