I wrote your name upon the back of my hand Slept upon it, then I woke up with it backwards on my face Reading forwards from my mirror to my heart Twilight omens in my life Then I hear your name Hear the radio sing your name Should I give you a call? What can I say? Maybe you still feel the same I typed your number into my calculator Where it spelled a dirty word When you turned it upside down You can turn my dirty world the right way round Twilight omens in my life Then I heard your name Hear the radio sing your name Should I give you a call? What can I say? Maybe I still feel the same Twilight omens in my life I keep hearing your name I keep hearing your name I keep hearing your name I hear the radio sing your name I hear the radio sing your name I hear the radio sing your name
