I wrote your name upon the back of my handSlept upon it, then I woke up with it backwards on my faceReading forwards from my mirror to my heartTwilight omens in my lifeThen I hear your nameHear the radio sing your nameShould I give you a call?What can I say?Maybe you still feel the sameI typed your number into my calculatorWhere it spelled a dirty wordWhen you turned it upside downYou can turn my dirty world the right way roundTwilight omens in my lifeThen I heard your nameHear the radio sing your nameShould I give you a call?What can I say?Maybe I still feel the sameTwilight omens in my lifeI keep hearing your nameI keep hearing your nameI keep hearing your nameI hear the radio sing your nameI hear the radio sing your nameI hear the radio sing your name
