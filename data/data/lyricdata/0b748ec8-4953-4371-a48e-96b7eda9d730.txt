White moon, white moonBreaks open the tombOf a deserted cartoon that I wroteCreature come, creature, creatureMy own double featureAs I'm warming the bleachers at homeWell, my nose keeps on bleedingCause it's Rita I'm needingI better call out a meeting of the boysOf the boysMy friends are all dyingAnd death can't be lyingIt's the truth and it don't make a noiseOh Rita, oh RitaIf you lived in MesitaI would move you with the beat of a drumAnd this picture is proofThat although you're aloofYou had the shiniest tooth 'neath the sunEasy come, easy goBe a star of the showI'm giving up all I know to get moreTo get morePhotograph the pictureYoung grunt pin-up scriptureFor locker-tagged memories of warA mirage, this garageAnd a photo montageAnd a finger massage from the hostGood lord, good lordThe one I adoreAnd I cannot afford is a ghostIs a ghostProto-social is the wordAnd the word is the birdThat flew through the herd in the snowIn the snowLemonade me, then grade meThen deliver my babyAnd if my friends all persuade me, I'll goBlink, blink at me RitaDon't you know I'm a bleeder?And I promised I wouldn't lead her onBut she met me, then led meAnd I ate what was fed meTill I purged every word in this song
