I'm sitting here in the boring roomIt's just another rainy Sunday afternoonI'm wasting my timeI got nothing to doI'm hanging aroundI'm waiting for youBut nothing ever happens and I wonderI'm driving around in my carI'm driving too fastI'm driving too farI'd like to change my point of viewI feel so lonelyI'm waiting for youBut nothing ever happens and I wonderI wonder howI wonder whyYesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue skyAnd all that I can see is just a yellow lemon-treeI'm turning my head up and downI'm turning turning turning turning turning aroundAnd all that I can see is just another lemon-treeSing, dah...I'm sitting hereI miss the powerI'd like to go out taking a showerBut there's a heavy cloud inside my headI feel so tiredPut myself into bedWhile nothing ever happens and I wonderIsolation is not good for meIsolation I don't want to sit on the lemon-treeI'm steppin' around in the desert of joyBaby anyhow I'll get another toyAnd everything will happen and you wonderI wonder howI wonder whyYesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue skyAnd all that I can see is just another lemon-treeI'm turning my head up and downI'm turning turning turning turning turning aroundAnd all that I can see is just a yellow lemon-treeYellow, wonder, wonderI wonder howI wonder whyYesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue skyAnd all that I can see, and all that I can see, and all that I can seeIs just a yellow lemon-tree
