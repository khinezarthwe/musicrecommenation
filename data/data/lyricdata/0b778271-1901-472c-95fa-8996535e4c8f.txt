They were sittingThey were sitting in the strawberry swingEvery moment was so preciousThey were sittingThey were talking in the strawberry swingEverybody was for fightingWouldn't want to waste a thingCold cold water, bring me 'roundNow my feet won't touch the groundCold cold water, whatcha say?It's such, it's such a perfect dayIt's such a perfect dayI rememberWe were walking up to strawberry swingI can't wait 'til the morningWouldn't want to change a thingPeople moving all the timeInside a perfectly straight lineDon't you wanna just curve away?And it's such, it's such a perfect dayIt's such a perfect dayAhh...Now the sky could be blueI don't mindWithout you, it's a waste of timeCould be blueI don't mindWithout you, it's a waste of timeNow the sky could be blueCould be greyWithout you, I'm just miles awayNow the sky could be blueI don't mindWithout you, it's a waste of time
