Building a bridge across where we live There's roots in my ground and I stretch across town I couldn't care less if I live in my head I've shed all my tears and I'm better than bored Oh, this ship was built to last Yeah, this ship was built to last Move your hands on, release me in love Weather the rain and pleasure my skin I'm building a bridge across where we live I've fed all the hurt now I just have to learn How this ship was built to last Oh, this ship was built to last See where she blows That's when we go The breeze takes my hand This ship takes over Drip upon drop overflowing the cup Now I'm running in light, I whip multiple cries They echo around all the walls of my heart Yeah worry no more when love leans 'gainst the door Oh, this ship was built to last Oh, this ship was built to last Oh, this ship was built to last Oh, this ship was built to last Yeah, this ship was built to last
