I hurt myself todayTo see if I still feelI focus on the painThe only thing that's realThe needle tears a holeThe old familiar stingTry to kill it all awayBut I remember everythingWhat have I becomeMy sweetest friendEveryone I knowGoes away in the endAnd you could have it allMy empire of dirtI will let you downI will make you hurtI wear this crown of thornsUpon my liars chairFull of broken thoughtsI cannot repairBeneath the stains of timeThe feelings disappearYou are someone elseI am still right hereWhat have I becomeMy sweetest friendEveryone I knowGoes away in the endAnd you could have it allMy empire of dirtI will let you downI will make you hurtIf I could start againA million miles awayI would keep myselfI would find a way
