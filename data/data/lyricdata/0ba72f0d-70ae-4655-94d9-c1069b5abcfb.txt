I walk a lonely roadThe only one that I have ever knownDon't know where it goesBut it's home to me and I walk aloneI walk this empty streetOn the boulevard of broken dreamsWhere the city sleepsAnd I'm the only one and I walk aloneI walk aloneI walk aloneI walk aloneI walk a-My shadow's the only one that walks beside meMy shallow heart's the only thing that's beatingSometimes I wish someone out there will find meTill then I walk aloneAh-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ahAh-ah, ah-ah, ah-ahI'm walking down the lineThat divides me somewhere in my mindOn the borderlineOf the edge and where I walk aloneRead between the linesWhat's fucked up and everything's alrightCheck my vital signsTo know I'm still alive and I walk aloneI walk aloneI walk aloneI walk aloneI walk a-My shadow's the only one that walks beside meMy shallow heart's the only thing that's beatingSometimes I wish someone out there will find meTill then I walk aloneAh-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ahAh-ah, ah-ahI walk aloneI walk a-I walk this empty streetOn the boulevard of broken dreamsWhere the city sleepsAnd I'm the only one and I walk a-My shadow's the only one that walks beside meMy shallow heart's the only thing that's beatingSometimes I wish someone out there will find meTill then I walk alone
