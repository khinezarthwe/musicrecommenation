I once had a love but soon had enoughHe was a false contenderHe got so thin there must have beenDeep sorrow gnawing away at himWhat will I do? Will it always be you?I hope and I pray, he'll leave me one dayWe were so sweet under the Copper BeachYou left a mark you sunk your teethInto the back of my neck, oh let's not pretendI needed the lesson that you taught me wellWhat will I do? Will it always be you?I hope and I pray, he'll leave me one dayWhat will I do? Will it always be you?I hope and I pray, he'll leave me one dayWhat will I do? Must it always be you?I hope and I pray, he'll leave me one dayLeave me one day, leave me one day, leave me one day
