You get a shiver in the darkIt's raining in the park but meantimeSouth of the river you stop and you hold everythingA band is blowing Dixie double four timeYou feel alright when you hear that music ringWell now you step inside but you don't see too many facesComing in out of the rain to hear the jazz go downCompetition in other placesAh but the horns, they blowing that soundWay on down south, way on down south, London townYou check out Guitar George, he knows all the chordsMind, he's strictly rhythm, he doesn't want to make it cry or singYes, and an old guitar is all he can affordWhen he gets up under the lights to play his thingAnd Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the sceneHe's got a daytime job, he's doing alrightHe can play the honky tonk like anythingSaving it up for Friday nightWith the Sultans, with the Sultans of SwingAnd a crowd of young boys, they're fooling around in the cornerDrunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform solesThey don't give a damn about any trumpet playing bandIt ain't what they call rock and rollThen the Sultans, yeah, the Sultans they play CreoleCreoleAnd then the man, he steps right up to the microphoneAnd says at last, just as the time bell rings"Goodnight, now it's time to go home"Then he makes it fast with one more thing"We are the Sultans, we are the Sultans of Swing"
