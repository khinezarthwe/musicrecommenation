If the fire's out babyHow you gonna keep me warmSupposing you left meWith the door wide open no one can leaveI know it's a lie I want it to be trueThe rest of the ride is riding on youOver goodbyes we'll buy some place forWishing you couldKeep me closerI'm a lazy dancerWhen you move I move with youWishing you couldKeep me closerI'm a lazy dancerWhen you move I move with youIf somebody's got soulIf somebody's got soulIf somebody's got soulIf somebody's got soulYou gotta make the moveMake the moveMake the moveI know it's a lie I want it to be trueThe rest of the ride is riding on youOver goodbyes we'll buy some place forWishing you couldKeep me closerI'm a lazy dancerWhen you move I move with youWishing you couldKeep me closerI'm a lazy dancerWhen you move I move with youWishing you couldKeep me closerI'm a lazy dancerWhen you move I move with youWishing you couldKeep me closerI'm a lazy dancerWhen you move I move with you
