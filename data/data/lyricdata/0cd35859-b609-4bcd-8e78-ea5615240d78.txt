On my first day back, my first day back in townFirst day, my first day back in townThe clouds up above, they were hummin' our songHummin,' hummin' our songMy biggest fear is if I let you goYou'll come and get me in my sleepMy biggest fear is if I let you goYou'll come and get me in my sleepCome and get me…I set my course, sail away from shoreSteady, steady as she goesA crash in the night, two worlds collideAnd when two worlds collide, no one survivesno one survives and……the reddest of reds, bluest of blues,the saddest of songs I sing for you and……My biggest fear is if I let you goYou'll come and get me in my sleepMy biggest fear is if I let you goYou'll come and get me in my sleepCome and get meCome and get me in my sleepCome and get meCome and get me in my sleep
