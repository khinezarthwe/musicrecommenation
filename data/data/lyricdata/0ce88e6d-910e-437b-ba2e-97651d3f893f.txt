Because it's Wednesday.And Wednesday night is the night that we usually make love.Monday night is my night to cook.Tuesday night we go and visit your mother.But Wednesday night we make sweet, weekly love.It's when everything is just right.There's nothing good on TV.You haven't had your after-work social sports team practice so you're not too tired.Oh boy, it's all on.You lean in and whisper something sexy in my ear likeI know what you're trying to say girl.You're trying to say,It's business, it's business timeI know what you're trying to sayYou're trying to say it's time for business, it's business time, oohIt's business, it's business timeOh, oh, oh, yeahThen we're in the bathroom, brushing our teeth.That's all part of the foreplay. I love foreplayA-chicka-chicka, a-chicka-chicka, a-chicka-chickow-ow-owwThen you sort out the recycling.That isn't part of the foreplay process but it is still very important.Next thing you know we're in the bedroom.You're wearing that baggy old ugly t-shirt you got from your work several years ago.Mmm, you know the one, baby...with the curry stain.OwI remove my clothes very, very clumsilyTripping sensuously over my pants.Now I'm naked, except for my socks.And you know when I'm down to just my socks what time it is.It's business, it's business timeYou know when I'm down to my socks it's time for businessThat's why they call it business socks, oohIt's business, it's business timeOh, yeah, yeahOoh, makin' love.Makin' love for...Makin' love for two...Makin' love for two...minutes.When it's with me, girl, you only need two minutesBecause I'm so intense.You whisper something sexy like,I know what you're trying to say.You're trying to say,Then you tell me you want some more.
