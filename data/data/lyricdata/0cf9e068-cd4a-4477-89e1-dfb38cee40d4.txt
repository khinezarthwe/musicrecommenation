The days were open lately Yet they ran on and on Mistakes are never likely And colors hardly run But now they're all mixed up And I don't know just what I see You're over everything All the lines escaping free A moment interrupts me And I can't find my place Some voices all around here But I won't back away Instead I talk to you And you're so hard to figure out One minute into fear The next you have me breathin' out It's a hard wait (yeah) Hard wait (yeah) Hard wait (yeah) It's a hard wait (yeah) When every second takes its toll With every kiss you kill me more But I'm here and I decide So come close and watch me 'til I die It's true I understand too well This press of touch and go Still search your heart for secrets That I'll find out on my own Come on just give me something Or let me be left alone And hide my face in the crowd Just keeps me moving, yeah moving, yeah It's a hard wait (yeah) Hard wait (yeah) Hard wait (yeah) Hard wait (yeah) When you can never feel at home' Cause you've been off and away too long And it's too much just to leave again So you figured that you'll stay instead Ooooo- Oo- Ooo Ooooo- Oo- Ooo Ooooo- Oo- Ooo Ooooo- Oo- Ooo Ooooo- Oo- Ooooo, Oo Ooooo- Oo- Ooooo, Oooo Ooooo- Oo- Ooooo Ooooo- Oo- Ooooooooooo O W Hard wait (yeah) Hard wait (yeah) Hard wait (yeah) Oh, it's a hard wait (yeah) Just to teeter on the falling edge And in the end it's just another stretch To find someone you could understand Find someone who's got their tact in hand With every move and every stance Every wink and every glance You get caught up in another night And you hit me with those hazel eyes
