I feel uptight when I walk in the cityI feel so cold when I'm at homeFeels like everything's starting to hit meI lost my bearings ten minutes agoModern guilt, I'm stranded with nothingModern guilt, I'm under lock-and-keyMisapprehension is turning into conventionDon't know what I've done but I feel ashamedStanding outside the glass on the sidewalkThese people talk about impossible thingsAnd I'm falling out of the conversationLike a pawn piece in a human shieldModern guilt is all in our handsModern guilt won't get me to bedSay what you will, smoke your last cigaretteDon't know what I've done but I feel afraid
