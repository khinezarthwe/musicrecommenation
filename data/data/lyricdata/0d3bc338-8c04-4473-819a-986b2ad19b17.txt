In like the rose that grows in your soulOut of time, now you're out for moreIn like the stone that forms in your heartOut of reach but you can't give up this timeI'm on a wireTo see your starShineIn like the sun that falls on us allOut of time but you can't let goInto the dark you've stumbled aloneOut of sight, now you can't return this timeI'm on a wireTo see your starShineI'm on a wireTo see your starI've been blindI've torn out my eyes, but I fear no moreI've been blindYou've turned from my side, but I felt your voiceIn like the cold that grows in your bonesOut of time, now you can't go onEnd of the road you've taken aloneDevil's hands will replace the ones I've knownI'm on a wireTo see your starShineI'm on a wireTo see your star(Please darling)I'm on a wire(Hear me darling)I've taken your silence, but I can't no more(See darling, you don't owe them nothing)(Please darling)I'm on a wire(Hear me darling)You fade in the light where I can't follow(See darling, you don't owe them nothing)Time keeps this love aliveBut your hope is gone
