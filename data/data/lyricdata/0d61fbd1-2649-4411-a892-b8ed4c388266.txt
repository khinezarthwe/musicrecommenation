How can I forget youDisregard how I feelSilently listenTo the words I can't seeAs long as I have triedAs low as I can beI will never resign myselfFrom the trial I seekWhy should I forgive youAfter all that I've seenQuietly whisperWhen my heart wants to screamFor as long as I have triedAnd as low as I can beI will never resign myselfFrom the trial I seekThere's no time to restOr to reconsiderFor this cruel unsaidWon't concedeFor as long as I have triedAnd as low as I can beI will never resign myselfFrom the trial I seek
