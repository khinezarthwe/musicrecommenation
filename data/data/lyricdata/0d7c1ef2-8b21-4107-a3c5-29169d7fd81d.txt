A fire burnsWater comesYou cool me downWhen I'm cold insideYou are warm and brightYou know you are so good for me, yeahWith your child's eyesYou are more than you seemYou see into spaceI see in your faceThe places you've beenThe things you have learnedThey sit with you so beautifully, yeahYou know there's no need to hide awayYou know I tell the truthWe are just the sameAnd I can feel everything you doHear everything you sayEven when you're miles away'Cause I am me, the universe and youAnd just like stars burning brightMaking holes in the nightWe are building bridgesAnd you know there's no need to hide awayYou know I tell the truthWe are just the sameAnd I can feel everything you doHear everything you sayEven when you're miles away'Cause I am me, the universe and youI'm the universe and youWhen you're on your ownI'll send you a signJust so you knowThat I am me, the universe and youThe universe and youThe universe and youI am the universe and you
