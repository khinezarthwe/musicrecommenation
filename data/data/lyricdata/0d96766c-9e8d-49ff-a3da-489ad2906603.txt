Grandma loved a sailor who sailed the frozen seaGrandpa was that whaler and he took me on his kneeHe said, "Son, I'm goin' crazy from livin' on the landGot to find my shipmates and walk on foreign sands."This old man was graceful, with silver in his smileHe smoked a briar pipe and he walked for country milesSinging songs of shady sisters and old-time libertySongs of love and songs of death and songs to set men freeI've got three ships and sixty menA course for ports unreadI'll stand at mast, let north winds blowTill half of us are deadLand ho!Well, if I get my hands on a dollar billGonna buy a bottle and drink my fillIf I get my hands on a number fiveGonna skin that little girl aliveIf I get my hands on a number twoCome back home and marry youMarry youMarry youAll right!Yeah, land hoYeah, land hoWell, if I get back homeAnd I feel all rightYou know I'm gonna love you tonightLove tonightLove tonightYeah, land ho!
