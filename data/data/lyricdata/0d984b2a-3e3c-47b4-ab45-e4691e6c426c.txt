You expected my war diariesBut time ran out and I, I let you downA small thanks note written in French is no shorthand for"This thing gave me writer's cramp"Another dream about shapeshiftingWell we move with such elegance, with such graceWith all our dignity just in placeDeer die with their eyes wide open, eyes wide open, eyes wide openDeer die with their eyes wide openDrawing tiny little pictures of skeletonsTo get across the sense of impending doomAnd the leaves like the artwork to "Major Leagues" look like dead foxes on the hard shoulderAnd for some reason I think that I attributed this storyTo the bypass of the town I hadn't visitedSo goes the backing track of all the sighs we'd ever sighedDeer die with their eyes wide open, eyes wide open, eyes wide openDeer die with their eyes wide openDrawing tiny little pictures of skeletonsTo get across the sense of impending doomAnd I am 17 pages through this notebook nowAnd there are little more than pictures of how I see you in an X-ray machineThat's more like a television screenAnd you're in a rut, and I know that you know what I meanAnd then the realisation hits that not even two gospel choirs could save us nowTurn up on your doorstepFeeling like roadkillTasting like postage stampsAnd when I touch youYou fold up like an envelopeWith everything I ever wrotePouring out of your mouth.
