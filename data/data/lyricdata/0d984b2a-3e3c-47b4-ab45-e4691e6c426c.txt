You expected my war diaries But time ran out and I, I let you down A small thanks note written in French is no shorthand for" This thing gave me writer's cramp" Another dream about shapeshifting Well we move with such elegance, with such grace With all our dignity just in place Deer die with their eyes wide open, eyes wide open, eyes wide open Deer die with their eyes wide open Drawing tiny little pictures of skeletons To get across the sense of impending doom And the leaves like the artwork to " Major Leagues" look like dead foxes on the hard shoulder And for some reason I think that I attributed this story To the bypass of the town I hadn't visited So goes the backing track of all the sighs we'd ever sighed Deer die with their eyes wide open, eyes wide open, eyes wide open Deer die with their eyes wide open Drawing tiny little pictures of skeletons To get across the sense of impending doom And I am 17 pages through this notebook now And there are little more than pictures of how I see you in an X-ray machine That's more like a television screen And you're in a rut, and I know that you know what I mean And then the realisation hits that not even two gospel choirs could save us now Turn up on your doorstep Feeling like roadkill Tasting like postage stamps And when I touch you You fold up like an envelope With everything I ever wrote Pouring out of your mouth.
