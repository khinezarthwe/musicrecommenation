I keep on fear, keep on loathingNothing brings it on I keep on fallingDecide what it is I can not findIt's subsides what you make itNever feel like you're gonna break itIt's gonna be alright alrightSleep until the morning comesThe sun will warm your soulSleep until the morning comes for youTil the morning it's alrightI can walk into the sunlight, into the day, into the day, to the dayI feel it falling, nothing comes to my mindBring it on in a different tideI feel alright, alrightI feel strong, i feel rigidIt's nothing to do with the visionOh feels so right, so rightSleep on tight, sleep on tightSleep until the sunlightSleep until sunlightSleep on tightSleep on tightSleep on tightSleep on tight, til the sunlightSleep on tight, til the sunlight burns you happyTil the sunlight burns you happy, till the sunlight burns a happy hole inYour heart,In your heartIn your heart...
