I'm tired of bars in Boston Been feeling small in New York Scared of guns in Houston And tired of business talk Don't want to talk about it, baby Don't want to get in no fight I just want to go to a rock androll show And shiver and shake all night There's a riot in the Hyatt And madness in the Holiday Inn So throw your big leg over me, babe I might not feel this good again Crazy The road can make you crazy Makes you bold And get cold Cold in your jelly roll So won't you Take me back to sunny days again I won't be leaving until the summer ends Leave me in the company of friends I left behind me many miles away Here, there, everywhere No doubt about it, I had my share Paid my dues, got my rock and roll shoes And thats all right? But I never, never, never Thought I'd see the day When I'd be dancing alone So take me where the music Take me where the music play Then you can Take me back to sunny days again I won't be leaving until the summer ends Leave me in the company of friends I left behind me many, oh so many I left behind me many miles away
