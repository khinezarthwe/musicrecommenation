Days like this, I don't know what to do with myselfall day -- and all nightI wander the halls along the walls and under mybreathI say to myselfI need fuel -- to take flightChorus:And there's too much going onbut it's calm under the waves, in the blue of myoblivionUnder the waves in the blue of my oblivionIs that why they call me a sullen girl -- sullengirlThey don't know I used to sail the deep and tranquilseaBut he washed me shore and he took my pearl --and left an empty shell of meChorus (1x)Under the waves in the blue of my oblivionIt's calm under the waves in the blue of my oblivion
