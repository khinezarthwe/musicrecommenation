Days like this, I don't know what to do with myselfall day -- and all night I wander the halls along the walls and under mybreath I say to myself I need fuel -- to take flight Chorus: And there's too much going onbut it's calm under the waves, in the blue of myoblivion Under the waves in the blue of my oblivion Is that why they call me a sullen girl -- sullengirl They don't know I used to sail the deep and tranquilsea But he washed me shore and he took my pearl --and left an empty shell of me Chorus (1x) Under the waves in the blue of my oblivion It's calm under the waves in the blue of my oblivion
