Fall is here, hear the yellBack to school, ring the bellBrand new shoes, walking bluesClimb the fence, books and pensI can tell that we are gonna be friendsI can tell that we are gonna be friendsWalk with me, Suzy LeeThrough the park and by the treeWe will rest upon the groundAnd look at all the bugs we've foundSafely walk to school without a soundSafely walk to school without a soundHere we are, no one elseWe walk to school all by ourselvesThere's dirt on our uniformsFrom chasing all the ants and wormsWe clean up and now it's time to learnWe clean up and now it's time to learnNumbers, letters, learn to spellNouns and books and show and tellAt playtime we will throw the ballBack to class, through the hallTeacher marks our height against the wallTeacher marks our height against the wallWe don't notice any time passWe don't notice anythingWe sit side-by-side in every classTeacher thinks that I sound funnyBut she likes the way you singTonight I'll dream while I'm in bedWhen silly thoughts go through my head'Bout the bugs and alphabetAnd when I wake tomorrow, I'll betThat you and I will walk together againI can tell that we are gonna be friendsYes, I can tell that we are gonna be friends
