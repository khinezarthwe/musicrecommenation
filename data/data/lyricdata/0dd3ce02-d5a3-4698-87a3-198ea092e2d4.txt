This is our music from the bachelor's den;the sound of lonliness turned up to ten;a horror soundtrack, from a stagnant waterbedand it sounds just like thisThis is the sound of someone losing the plotmaking out that they're ok when they're notYou're gonna like it but not a lotand the chorus goes like thisoh baby here comes the fear againthe end is near againa monkey's built a house on your back;you can't get anyone to come in the sackand here comes another panic attack ohhere we go againso now you know the words to my songpretty soon you'll all be singing alongwhen you're sad when you're lonely and it all turns out wrongwhen you've got the fearand when you're no longer searching for beauty or lovejust some kind of life with the edges taken offwhen you can't even define what it is that you are frightened ofthis song will be hereoh baby here comes the fear againthe end is near againif you ever get that chimp off your backif you ever find the thing that you lackoh you know you're only having a laugh ohoh here we go againuntil the enduntil the end
