Bring me homeTo this house of many daysJust lay me on the floorHard and cool as slateYou know I love it more and moreThan before I ran awayIt triggers off so many hurtsHurtful words and broken platesI've been lied toNow I'm FuzzyI've been lied toAll and allThe world is small enough for both of usTo meet upon the interstateWaiting on a trainAnd just when those big arms lift upFall in love with no time to say itAnd I would have liked toNow I'm FuzzyI would have liked toNow I'm FuzzyFuzzy nowHere we areIn our carDriving down the streetWe're looking for a place to stopHave a bite to eatWe hunger for a bit of faithTo replace the fearWe water like a dead bouquetDoes no good does it dearAnd I've been lied toNow I'm FuzzyWe've been lied toNow we're FuzzyFuzzy nowLied to.
