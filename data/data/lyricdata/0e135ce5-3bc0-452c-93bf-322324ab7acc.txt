Begin the day with a friendly voiceA companion unobtrusivePlays that song that's so elusiveAnd the magic music makes your morning moodOff on your way, hit the open roadThere is magic at your fingersFor the spirit ever lingersUndemanding contact in your happy solitudeInvisible airwaves crackle with lifeBright antennae bristle with the energyEmotional feedback on a timeless wavelengthBearing a gift beyond price, almost freeAll this machinery making modern musicCan still be open-heartedNot so coldly charted, it's really just a questionOf your honesty, yeah, your honestyOne likes to believe in the freedom of musicBut glittering prizes and endless compromisesShatter the illusion of integrity, yeahInvisible airwaves crackle with lifeBright antennae bristle with the energyEmotional feedback on a timeless wavelengthBearing a gift beyond price, almost freeFor the words of the profits were written on the studio wallConcert hallAnd echoes with the sound of salesmenOf salesmen, of salesmen
