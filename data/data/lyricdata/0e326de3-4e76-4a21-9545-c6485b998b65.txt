Caught up in this houseTrapped my very own self in the snare of my mindNo more space than a slitherWhat I'd give for a deep breath insideWhere the chaos has me captiveWhere there's no exist signWhere I fuel the stupid fire with these feelings of mineLured into this den, it's bitter and I want the sweetness againA taste that I agree withGet me past these perils and to my edenWhere the silence is a comfortWhere there is no one elseWhere I'll be up from under can uncurl my selfToo many, too much, too hardHelp meThis time I went too farToo many, too much, too hardHelp meThis time I went too farCan I smash all of this openCan I pass the hurt with a little painI wanna see all of it crumble and start afresh all over aginMy eyes are wide openBut I can hardly seeWill laughter find a way around these silent tearsToo many, too much, too hardHelp meThis time I went too farToo many, too much, too hardHelp meThis time I went too far
