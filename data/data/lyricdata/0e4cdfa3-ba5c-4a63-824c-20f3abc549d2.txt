I thought it was Easter timeThe way the light rose, rose that morningLately you've been on my mindYou showed me the rope, ropes to climbOver mountains and to pull myselfOut of a landslide, of a landslideI thought it was harvest timeYou always loved the smell of the wood burningShe with her honey hairDalhousie Castle, she would meet you thereIn the winter, butter yellowThe flames you stirred, yes, you could stirI raise a glass, make a toast, a toast in your honorI hear you laugh and beg me not to dance'Cause on your right, standing by, is Mister BojanglesWith a toast, he's telling me it's timeTo raise a glass, make a toast, a toast in your honourI hear you laugh and beg me not to dance'Cause on your right, standing by, is Mister BojanglesWith a toast he's telling me it's timeTo let you go, let you goI thought I'd see you againYou say you might doMaybe in a carvingIn a cathedralSomewhere in Barcelona
