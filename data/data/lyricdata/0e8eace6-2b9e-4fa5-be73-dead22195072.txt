Cut myself open wideReach insideHelp yourselfTo all I have to giveAnd then you help yourself againAnd then complain thatYou didn't like the wayI put the knife in wrongYou didn't like the wayMy blood spilled on your brand new floorWhat would you sayIf I walked awayWould you appreciateBut then it'd be too late'Cause I can only take so much of your ungrateful waysEverything is never enoughSacrifice my lifeNeglect my kids and wifeAll for you to be happyAll those sleepless nightsAnd countless fights to give you moreAnd then you say how dare thatI didn't write you backI must be too good for youI only care about myselfWhat would you sayIf I walked awayWould you appreciateBut then it'd be too late'Cause I can only take so much of your ungrateful waysEverything is never enough
