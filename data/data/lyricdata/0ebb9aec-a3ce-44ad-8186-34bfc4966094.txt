Two ravens in the old oak tree and One for you and one for me and Bluebells in the late December I see signs now all the time The last time we slept together There was something that was not there You never wanted to alarm me But I'm the one that's drowning now I could sleep forever these days' Cause in my dreams I see you again But this time fleshed out full face In your confirmation dress It was so like you to visit me to Let me know you were okay It was so like you to visit me Always worried about someone else At your funeral I was so upset So, so upset In your life you were larger than this Statuesque, statuesque I see signs now all the time That you're not dead, you're sleeping I'd believe in anything That brings you back home to me
