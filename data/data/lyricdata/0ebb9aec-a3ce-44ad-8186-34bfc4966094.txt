Two ravens in the old oak tree andOne for you and one for me andBluebells in the late DecemberI see signs now all the timeThe last time we slept togetherThere was something that was not thereYou never wanted to alarm meBut I'm the one that's drowning nowI could sleep forever these days'Cause in my dreams I see you againBut this time fleshed out full faceIn your confirmation dressIt was so like you to visit me toLet me know you were okayIt was so like you to visit meAlways worried about someone elseAt your funeral I was so upsetSo, so upsetIn your life you were larger than thisStatuesque, statuesqueI see signs now all the timeThat you're not dead, you're sleepingI'd believe in anythingThat brings you back home to me
