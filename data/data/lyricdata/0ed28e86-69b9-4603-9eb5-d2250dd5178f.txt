Well, it's back to the battle today.But I wouldn't have it any other way.Cause tonight we'll be crazy as kooks.I'm dancing, grooving. This lovely wooden floor.The tom-toms are beating on. Eyes are so sore.There is still sand in my suitcase.There is still salt in my teeth.I kissed her in the window.She covered up her face.She's pretty, Sherry.But I'm far, far too late.Someone said, man, let's take a drive.So here I am. So here I am.I crashed up a party, nickels and dimes,A handful of strangers, all friends of mine.I know that you're married, rings on your hand.So I didn't stay 'til the end.I don't need a Christmas card.You don't need to write.Last Christmas was black and blue, but this year is white.The void repeats, repeats a sound so deep in my head.Goodnight. Keep your shirt on. You can leave the way you came.
