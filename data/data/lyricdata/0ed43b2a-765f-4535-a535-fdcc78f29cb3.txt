I know I said I love you but I'm thinking I was wrong, I'm the first to admit that I'm still pretty young, And I never meant to hurt you when I wrote you ten love songs. That guy that I could never get, 'cause his girlfriend was pretty fit, And everyone who knew her loved her so. And I made you leave her for me and now I'm feeling pretty mean, But my mind has fucked me over more times than any man could ever know. Maybe I should give up, give in, Give up trying to be thin, Give up and turn into my mother, God knows I love her. And I'm sorry to whichever man should meet my sorry state, Watch my sturdy, lonesome gate and beware, I will never love a man 'cause love and pain go hand in hand, And I can't do it, again. So we stayed up late one night to try and get our problems right, But I couldn't get into his head just what was going through my mind. And I think he knew where I was going 'cause he put Ryan Adams on,'cause I think he thinks it makes me weak, but it only ever makes me strong. I've got this friend who sounds just like him, Now he's the man I leave you for, the man that I just adore, Like you. The same man, he turns to me, he said " I've got to tell you how I feel, If God could make the perfect girl, for me it would be you, And my God told me not to tell about how much do you love your fella?" I don't know more everyday, Not in this new romantic way. I'll always be your first love, You'll always be my first love. But I'm sorry to whichever man should meet my sorry state, Watch my sturdy, lonesome gate and beware, I will never love a man 'cause love and pain go hand in hand I will never love a man 'cause I could never hurt a man, Not in this new romantic way.
