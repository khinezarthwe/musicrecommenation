Now I've heard there was a secret chordThat David played, and it pleased the LordBut you don't really care for music, do you?It goes like this the fourth, the fifthThe minor fall, the major liftThe baffled king composing HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahYour faith was strong but you needed proofYou saw her bathing on the roofHer beauty and the moonlight overthrew youShe tied you to a kitchen chairShe broke your throne, and she cut your hairAnd from your lips she drew the HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahYou say I took the name in vainI don't even know the nameBut if I did, well really, what's it to you?There's a blaze of light in every wordIt doesn't matter which you heardThe holy or the broken HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahI did my best, it wasn't muchI couldn't feel, so I tried to touchI've told the truth, I didn't come to fool youAnd even though it all went wrongI'll stand before the Lord of SongWith nothing on my tongue but HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah, HallelujahHallelujah
