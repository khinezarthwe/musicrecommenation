I tried so hard all summer through Not to think too much of you But the more I try, the more I find I just can't leave the past behind Times that are happy Are times that are few And once I was happy When I had you But days have come and gone Since you were here Nights are twice as long Without you near Pictures on my mind Stand out so clear No matter where I am or what I do My darling, all I see is you You're there in every dream I ever dream There at every place I've ever been Everyday I find You're in my heart and on my mind I close my eyes, but I'm not blind I see you still And when I throw my arms out wide I find that you're not by my side But one thing is for sure, until I do All I see is you Everyday I find You're in my heart and on my mind I close my eyes, but I'm not blind I see you still, oh I won't live again Till I'm with you Oh darling, I won't love again Unless it's with you So until the day When you are back with me to stay In every way All I see is you
