I tried so hard all summer throughNot to think too much of youBut the more I try, the more I findI just can't leave the past behindTimes that are happyAre times that are fewAnd once I was happyWhen I had youBut days have come and goneSince you were hereNights are twice as longWithout you nearPictures on my mindStand out so clearNo matter where I am or what I doMy darling, all I see is youYou're there in every dreamI ever dreamThere at every placeI've ever beenEveryday I findYou're in my heart and on my mindI close my eyes, but I'm not blindI see you stillAnd when I throw my arms out wideI find that you're not by my sideBut one thing is for sure, until I doAll I see is youEveryday I findYou're in my heart and on my mindI close my eyes, but I'm not blindI see you still, ohI won't live againTill I'm with youOh darling, I won't love againUnless it's with youSo until the dayWhen you are back with me to stayIn every wayAll I see is you
