If I were a boyEven just for a dayI'd roll outta bed in the morningAnd throw on what I wanted and goDrink beer with the guysAnd chase after girlsI'd kick it with who I wantedAnd I'd never get confronted for itCause they'd stick up for meIf I were a boyI think I could understandHow it feels to love a girlI swear I'd be a better manI'd listen to herCause I know how it hurtsWhen you lose the one you wantedCause he's taken you for grantedAnd everything you had got destroyedIf I were a boyI would turn off my phoneTell everyone it's brokenSo they'd think that I was sleepin' aloneI'd put myself firstAnd make the rules as I goCause I know that she'd be faithfulWaitin' for me to come home (to come home)If I were a boyI think I could understandHow it feels to love a girlI swear I'd be a better manI'd listen to herCause I know how it hurtsWhen you lose the one you wantedCause he's taken you for grantedAnd everything you had got destroyedIt's a little too late for you to come backSay it's just a mistakeThink I'd forgive you like thatIf you thought I would wait for youYou thought wrongBut you're just a boyYou don't understandYeah you don't understandHow it feels to love a girl somedayYou wish you were a better manYou don't listen to herYou don't care how it hurtsUntil you lose the one you wantedCause you've taken her for grantedAnd everything you have got destroyedBut you're just a boy
