We stumble in a tangled webDecaying friendships almost deadAnd hide behind a mask of lies.We twist and turn and we avoidAll the hope of salvage now devoidI see the truth inside your eyes.So take all this noise to your brainSend it back againI'll bear the cost, shed my skin, call you up and then...I'll say the words out loud.You can resurrect a thousand words to deceive me more and more.A thousand words will give the reason why I don't need you anymore.Time manipulates your heart,Preconceptions torn apartBegin to doubt my state of mind.But I won't go down on what I saidI won't retract, convictions readI may perplex but I'm not blind.So take all this noise to your brainSend it back again.I'll bear the cost, shed my skin, call you up, and then...I'll say the words out loud.You can resurrect a thousand words to deceive me more and more.A thousand words will give the reason why I don't need you anymore.I'll say the words out loudI'll say a thousand words or moreManipulation. Fabrication. Conversation. Annihilation.I'll say a thousand words or more.Damnation. Frustration. Elevation. Procreation.I'll say a thousand words or more.You can resurrect a thousand words to deceive me more and more.A thousand words will give the reason why I don't need you anymore.
