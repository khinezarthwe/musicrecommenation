Kinda like a cloud I was up way up in the skyAnd I was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believeSometimes I don't believe them myselfAnd I decided I was never coming downJust then a tiny little dotCaught my eye it was just about, just about too small to seeBut I watched it way too longIt was pulling me downShut up!So what, what does it matter now?I was swimming in the haze now I crawl on the groundAnd everything I never liked about you is kinda seeping into meTry to laugh about it now but isn't it funny how everything works out"I guess the joke's on me," she saidI was up above itNow I'm down in itI used to be so big and strong!I used to know my right from wrong!I used to never be afraid!I used to be somebody!I used to have something inside!Now just this whole that's open wide!I used to want it all!I used to be somebody..I'll cross my heart I'll hope to dieBut the needle's already in my eyeAnd all the world's weight is on my backAnd I don't even know whyWhat I used to think was meIs just a fading memoryI looked him right in the eye and said "Goodbye"I was up above itNow I'm down in it
