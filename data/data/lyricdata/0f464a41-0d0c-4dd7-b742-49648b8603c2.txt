I can still remember when your city smelt excitingI still get a whiff of that aroma now and thenBurglary and fireworks, the skies they were alightingAccidents and toffee drops and thinking on the trainOh, he was young in the frostNo regard for the costOf saying his feelingsIn the moment they were feltAnd if he was calm like youLocked up inside of our loopsThen he'd know full wellThat all he had to say wasAll he had to say was goodbyeSummertime made promises it knew it couldn't keepThe fairytale was climbing up a mountain far too steepColouring the pictures with your loyal handNow I am craving heartbreak while you're making your demandsOh, he was young in the frostNo regard for the costOf saying his feelingsIn the moment they were feltAnd if he was calm like youLocked up inside of our loopsThen he'd know full wellThat all he had to say wasAll he had to say was goodbyeIf he was calm like youLocked up inside of our loopsThen he'd know full wellThat all he had to say wasAll he had to say was goodbye
