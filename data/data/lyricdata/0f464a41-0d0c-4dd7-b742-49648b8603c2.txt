I can still remember when your city smelt exciting I still get a whiff of that aroma now and then Burglary and fireworks, the skies they were alighting Accidents and toffee drops and thinking on the train Oh, he was young in the frost No regard for the cost Of saying his feelings In the moment they were felt And if he was calm like you Locked up inside of our loops Then he'd know full well That all he had to say was All he had to say was goodbye Summertime made promises it knew it couldn't keep The fairytale was climbing up a mountain far too steep Colouring the pictures with your loyal hand Now I am craving heartbreak while you're making your demands Oh, he was young in the frost No regard for the cost Of saying his feelings In the moment they were felt And if he was calm like you Locked up inside of our loops Then he'd know full well That all he had to say was All he had to say was goodbye If he was calm like you Locked up inside of our loops Then he'd know full well That all he had to say was All he had to say was goodbye
