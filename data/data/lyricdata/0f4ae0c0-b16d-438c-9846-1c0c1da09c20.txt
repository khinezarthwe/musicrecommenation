Seventeen, a nature's queen You know what I mean Twenty-one, a long one You can see the numbers run Now you look so peaceful Lyin' there asleep With the wings of God above you Before the spirits meet Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom Shadow earth is closin' in Above the lamps in your street Lucifer goes walkin' Down for you to meet Minutes pass so slowly by The hands on your clock Heavens don't just open You can knock Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom With the darkness closin' in Will the light reveal your soul? Just one sweet kiss On your clay cold lips A long sleep you'll never know Where do we go, where do we go? Where do we go from here? Seventeen, a nature's queen You know what I mean Twenty-one, a long one You can see the numbers run Now you look so peaceful Lyin' there asleep With the wings of God above you Before the spirits meet Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
