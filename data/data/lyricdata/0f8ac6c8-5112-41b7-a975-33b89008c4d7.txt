There's a lot of strange men in cell block tenBut the strangest of em' allWas a friend of mine who spent his timeStarin at the wall...Starin at the wall...In his hand was a note that his gal had wroteProving crime don't payWas the very same gal he robbed and stole forWanting thier wedding day...Wanting thier wedding day...As he looked at the wallSo strong and tallI heard him softly curseNobody at all ever climbed that wallBut I'm gonna be the first...I'm gonna be the first...Then the warden walked by and said son don't tryI'd hate to see you fallCause there is no doubt they'll carry you outIf you ever touch that wall...If you ever touch that wall...Well a years gone by since he made his tryBut I can still recallHow hard he tried and the way he diedBut he never made that wall...He never made that wall...Well there's never been a man who shook this campBut I knew a man who triedThe newspapers called it a jailbreak planBut I know it was suicide...I know it was suicide...
