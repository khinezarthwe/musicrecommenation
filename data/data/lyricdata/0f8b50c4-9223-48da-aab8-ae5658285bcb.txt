Child of burning timeChild of burning timeMy only consolation is a lieThe apex of my consequence is dying here tonightWinter hasn't ended and it always looks like rainI can't remember anything (anything)Inside the absolution, we succumbAnd appetites are bittersweet; I think I'm going numbA chance to give up avarice has marked my one regretThe child of burning time is goneHe hasn't come back yet...Before I tell my story, please consider who I amI missed my window years ago; I'm doing all I canA tragedy is commonplace, but in the end, they go awayMy skin is still the only stain I'm left to wear in shameI cut my name into my heartI'll tear it all apartI beg youBurn me awayI won't become your hero just to fight the life I saveBurn me awayI won't give up tomorrow just to lose it all todayI burn awayMy isolation is my courseThe effect it has on life itself is a cancer on its sourceI rue the moments spent between the fetish and the flameUntil this war is over, I won't ever lose my rageI cut my name into my soulI guess I'll never knowI beg youBurn me awayI won't become your hero just to fight the life I saveBurn me awayI won't give up tomorrow just to lose it all todayBurn me awayI won't become your hero just to fight the life I saveBurn me awayI won't give up tomorrow just to lose it all, lose it all today
