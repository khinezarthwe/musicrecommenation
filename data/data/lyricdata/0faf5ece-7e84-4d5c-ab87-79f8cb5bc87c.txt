"Look out the left," the captain said"The lights down there, that's where we'll land"Saw a falling star burningHigh above the Las Vegas sandIt wasn't the one that you gave to meThat night down south between the trailersNot the early one that you wish uponNot the northern one that guides in the sailorsYou've got that touch so gentle and sweetBut you've got that look so criticalCan't talk to you babe, you know I get so weakSometimes I think that love is just mythicalUp there's a heaven, down there's a townBlackness everywhere any little lights shineBlackness, blackness draggin' me downCome on light a candle in this heart of mineStarbright, starbright, you've got the lovin' that I likeTurn this crazy bird aroundShould not have got on this flight tonightI'm drinkin' sweet champagne, got the headphones up highCan't numb you, can't drum you out of my mindThey're singin', "Goodbye babyBaby bye-byeOoh! Love is blind"Up go the flaps, down go the wheelsHope you got your heat turned on, babyHope they've finally fixed your automobileHope it's better when we meet again, babeStarbright, starbright, you've got the lovin' that I likeTurn this crazy bird aroundShould not have got on this flight tonightShould not have got on this flight tonight
