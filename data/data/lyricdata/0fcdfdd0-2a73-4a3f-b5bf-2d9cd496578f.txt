All around me are familiar facesWorn-out places, worn-out facesBright and early for their daily racesGoing nowhere, going nowhereTheir tears are filling up their glassesNo expression, no expressionHide my head, I want to drown my sorrowNo tomorrow, no tomorrowAnd I find it kind of funnyI find it kind of sadThe dreams in which I'm dyingAre the best I've ever hadI find it hard to tell youI find it hard to takeWhen people run in circles it's a very, veryMad worldMad worldChildren waiting for the day they feel goodHappy birthday, happy birthdayAnd I feel the way that every child shouldSit and listen, sit and listenWent to school and I was very nervousNo one knew me, no one knew meHello, teacher, tell me, what's my lesson?Look right through me, look right through meAnd I find it kind of funnyI find it kind of sadThe dreams in which I'm dyingAre the best I've ever hadI find it hard to tell youI find it hard to takeWhen people run in circles it's a very, veryMad worldMad worldEnlarging your worldMad world
