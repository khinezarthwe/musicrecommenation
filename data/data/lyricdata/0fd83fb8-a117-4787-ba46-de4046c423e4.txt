All this feels strange and untrueAnd I won't waste a minute without youMy bones ache, my skin feels coldAnd I'm getting so tired and so oldThe anger swells in my gutsAnd I won't feel these slices and cutsI want so much to open your eyes'Cause I need you to look into mineTell me that you'll open your eyesTell me that you'll open your eyesTell me that you'll open your eyesTell me that you'll open your eyesGet up, get out, get away from these liars'Cause they don't get your soul or your fireTake my hand, knot your fingers through mineAnd we'll walk from this dark room for the last timeEvery minute from this minute nowWe can do what we like anywhereI want so much to open your eyes'Cause I need you to look into mineTell me that you'll open your eyesTell me that you'll open your eyesTell me that you'll open your eyesTell me that you'll open your eyesTell me that you'll open your eyesTell me that you'll open your eyesTell me that you'll open your eyesTell me that you'll open your eyesAll this feels strange and untrueAnd I won't waste a minute without you
