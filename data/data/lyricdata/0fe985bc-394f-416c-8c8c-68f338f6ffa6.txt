The sun got stuck, as it's making its way back downWe find ourselves, in a familiar part of townAnd all that I've seen means nothing to me, without youSo when I see you next we'll make the most of itTell the sun to start moving againThe taste of your kiss I've still got on my lipsAnd I'll take you there with meHead crashed down, air condition myself to sleepA great night out, that will continue to the end of the weekAnd all that I've seen means nothing to me, without youSo when I see you next we'll make the most of itTell the sun to start moving againThe taste of your kiss I've still got on my lipsAnd I'll take you there with meIt's you and me connected to a satelliteIt's you and me and love through a machineIt's you and me connected to a satelliteIt's you and me and love through a machineSo when I see you next we'll make the most of itTell the sun to start moving againThe taste of your kiss I've still got on my lipsAnd I'll take you there with me
