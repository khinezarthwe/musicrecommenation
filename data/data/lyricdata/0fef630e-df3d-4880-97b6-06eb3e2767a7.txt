Started like seed a twinkle in an eye Slowly growing daily growing deeper inside Only mother nature knows, knows the reasons why We fall in love each morning when you open your neweyes Keep smiling just like an angel, tiny finger tipstouching mine Only mother nature knows, knows the reason why We fell in love the first time that we heard yousoftly cry Open your eyes to the morning won't you Open your eyes to the morning won't you Open your eyes to the morning of new life So begins the day The morning of new life Tender is the way the sun sets the world alight Only mother nature knows, knows the reasons why We fall in love each morning when you open your neweyes Keep smiling just like an angel, tiny finger tipstouching mine Only mother nature knows, knows the reason why We fell in love the morning you were born my morningchild Open your eyes to the morning won't you Open your eyes to the morning won't you Open your eyes to the morning of new life
