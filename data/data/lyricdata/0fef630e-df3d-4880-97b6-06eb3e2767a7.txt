Started like seed a twinkle in an eyeSlowly growing daily growing deeper insideOnly mother nature knows, knows the reasons whyWe fall in love each morning when you open your neweyesKeep smiling just like an angel, tiny finger tipstouching mineOnly mother nature knows, knows the reason whyWe fell in love the first time that we heard yousoftly cryOpen your eyes to the morning won't youOpen your eyes to the morning won't youOpen your eyes to the morning of new lifeSo begins the dayThe morning of new lifeTender is the way the sun sets the world alightOnly mother nature knows, knows the reasons whyWe fall in love each morning when you open your neweyesKeep smiling just like an angel, tiny finger tipstouching mineOnly mother nature knows, knows the reason whyWe fell in love the morning you were born my morningchildOpen your eyes to the morning won't youOpen your eyes to the morning won't youOpen your eyes to the morning of new life
