The morning is deadAnd the day is, tooThere's nothing left here to meet meBut the velvet moonAll my loneliness I have felt todayIt's a little more than enoughTo make a man throw himself awayAnd I continueTo burn the midnight lamp, aloneNow the smiling portrait of youIs still hangin' on my frowning wallIt really doesn't, really doesn't bother me too much at allIt's just the ever falling dustThat makes it so hard for me to seeThat forgotten earring layin' on the floorFacing coldly towards the doorI continueTo burn the midnight lamp, aloneLoneliness is such a dragSo here I sit to faceThat same old fire placeGettin' ready for the same old explosionGoin' through my mindAnd soon enough time will tell,About the serpents in the wishing wellAnd someone who will buy and sell for meSomeone to toll my bellAnd I continueTo burn the same ol' lamp, aloneYeah!Darlin', can't ya hear me callin' you?So lonelyGonna blow my mindYeah, yeah, lonely, lonely...
