Go away go away You fill my headspace With evil thoughts unkind I can do without do without You move with hate Your darkness my light cannot take You deceive without a second thought I receive my heart an open world You say you hurt yourself When you fuss around But I feel your soul penetrate When you gaze your touch With desire On another domain I say to myself walt tall Head held high don't look behind Not good things to find Go ahead Taste with your eyes Feel with your head And think with your heart Look up to celebrate with nails Blood red See a moon halfway clear in the sky I wonder if you do from underground Weakened flesh!
