Go away go awayYou fill my headspaceWith evil thoughts unkindI can do without do withoutYou move with hateYour darkness my light cannot takeYou deceive without a second thoughtI receive my heart an open worldYou say you hurt yourselfWhen you fuss aroundBut I feel your soul penetrateWhen you gaze your touchWith desireOn another domainI say to myself walt tallHead held high don't look behindNot good things to findGo aheadTaste with your eyesFeel with your headAnd think with your heartLook up to celebrate with nailsBlood redSee a moon halfway clear in the skyI wonder if you do from undergroundWeakened flesh!
