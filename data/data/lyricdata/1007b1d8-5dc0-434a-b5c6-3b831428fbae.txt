Sucker love is heaven sent. You pucker up, our passion's spentMy heart's a tart, your body's rent. My body's broken, yours is bentCarve your name into my arm. Instead of stressed I lie here charmed'Cause there's nothing else to do. Every me and every youSucker love, a box I choose. No other box I choose to useAnother love I would abuse. No circumstances could excuseIn the shape of things to come. Too much poison; come undone'Cause there's nothing else to do. Every me and every youEvery me and every you, every meSucker love is known to swing, prone to cling and waste these thingsPucker up for Heaven's sake, there's never been so much at stakeI serve my head up on a plate. It's only comfort calling late'Cause there's nothing else to do. Every me and every youEvery me and every you. Every meEvery me and every you. Every meLike the naked leads the blind; I know I'm selfish, I'm unkindSucker love, I always find someone to bruise and leave behindAll alone in space and time. There's nothing here, but what here's mineSomething borrowed, something blue. Every me and every youEvery me and every you. Every meEvery me and every you. Every meEvery me and every you. Every meEvery me and every you. Every meEvery me and every you, Every meEvery me and every you. Every me
