Screaming at the windowWatch me die another dayHopeless situationEndless price I have to paySanity, now it's beyond meThere's no choiceDiary of a madmanWalk the line again todayEntries of confusionDear diary, I'm here to stayManic depression befriends meHear his voiceSanity now it's beyond meThere's no choiceA sickened mind and spiritThe mirror tells me liesCould I mistake myself for someoneWho lives behind my eyes?Will he escape my soulOr will he live in me?Is he tryin' to get outOr tryin' to enter me?Voices in the darknessScream away my mental healthCan I ask a questionTo help me save me from myself?Enemies fill up the pagesAre they me?Monday till Sunday in stagesSet me free
