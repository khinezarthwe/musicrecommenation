Seek me, call me, I'll be waitingSeek me, call me, I'll be waitingYeahThis distance, this dissolutionI cling to memories while fallingSleep brings release and the hope of a new dayWaking the misery of being without youSurrender, I give inAnother moment is another eternityFor comfort,for solaceFor the end of my broken heartCompletion,I'll be waitingFor the end of my broken heartYou know me, you know me all too wellMy only desire; to bridge our divisionIn sorrow, I speak your nameAnd my voice mirrors, mirrors my tormentFor comfort,for solaceFor the end of my broken heartCompletion,I'll be waitingFor the end of my broken heartAm I breathing? My strength fails meYour picture, a bitter memory, yeahFor comfort,for solaceFor the end of my broken heart
