Seek me, call me, I'll be waiting Seek me, call me, I'll be waiting Yeah This distance, this dissolution I cling to memories while falling Sleep brings release and the hope of a new day Waking the misery of being without you Surrender, I give in Another moment is another eternity For comfort,for solace For the end of my broken heart Completion, I'll be waiting For the end of my broken heart You know me, you know me all too well My only desire; to bridge our division In sorrow, I speak your name And my voice mirrors, mirrors my torment For comfort,for solace For the end of my broken heart Completion, I'll be waiting For the end of my broken heart Am I breathing? My strength fails me Your picture, a bitter memory, yeah For comfort,for solace For the end of my broken heart
