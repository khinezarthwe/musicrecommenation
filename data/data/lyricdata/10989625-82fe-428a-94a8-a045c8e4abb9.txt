I swapped my innocence for prideCrushed the end within my strideSaid I'm strong now I know that I'm a leaverI love the sound of you walking awayYou walking awayMascara bleeds a blackened tear, ohAnd I am cold, yes I'm coldBut not as cold as you areI love the sound of you walking awayYou walking awayI love the sound of you walking awayWalking away, heyWhy don't you walk away?No buildings will fall downDon't you walk awayNo quake will split the groundWon't you walk away?The sun won't swallow the skyWon't you walk away?Statues will not cryDon't you walk awayWhy don't you walk away?I cannot turn to see those eyesAs apologies may riseI must be strong and stay an unbelieverAnd love the sound of you walking awayYou walking awayMascara bleeds into my eye, ohAnd I'm not cold, I am oldAt least as old as you areLa la la la la laAnd as you walk away?Oh as you walk away?Oh as you walk awayMy headstone crumbles downAs you walk awayThe Hollywood winds a-howlAs you walk awayThe Kremlin's fallingAs you walk awayRadio Four is staticAs you walk awayOh as you walk awayOh as you walk awayOh as you walk away, heyThe stab of stilettoOn a silent nightStalin smiles and Hitler laughsChurchill claps Mao Tse Tung on the back
