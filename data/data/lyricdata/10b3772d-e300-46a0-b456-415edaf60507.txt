I don't wanna be crippled and crackedShoulders, wrists, knees and backGround to dust and ashCrawling on all foursWhen you've got to feel it in your bonesWhen you've got to feel it in your bonesNow I can't climb the stairsPieces missing everywhereProzac painkillersWhen you've got to feel it in your bonesWhen you've got to feel it in your bonesAnd I used to fly like Peter PanAll the children flew when I touched their handsYou say you've got to feel it in your bonesYou say you've got to feel it in your bones
