There is no god up in the sky tonight No sign of heaven anywhere in sight All that was true is left behind Once I could see, now I am blind Don't want the dreams you try to sell This disease, I give it to myself How does it feel? Suck, suck, suck How does it feel? Suck, suck, suck She makes it sweeter than the sun It gets too tight, I come undone I bow my head to confess The temple walls are made of flesh Runs up my arm 'til I'm on track Itches the skin right off my back I'll heal your wounds I'll set you free I'm Jesus Christ on ecstasy How does it feel? Suck, suck, suck How does it feel? Suck, suck, suck How does it feel? Suck, suck, suck How does it feel? Suck, suck, suck How does it feel? Suck, suck, suck How does it feel? Suck, suck, suck
