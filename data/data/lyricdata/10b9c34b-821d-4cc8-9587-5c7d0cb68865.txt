There is no god up in the sky tonightNo sign of heaven anywhere in sightAll that was true is left behindOnce I could see, now I am blindDon't want the dreams you try to sellThis disease, I give it to myselfHow does it feel?Suck, suck, suckHow does it feel?Suck, suck, suckShe makes it sweeter than the sunIt gets too tight, I come undoneI bow my head to confessThe temple walls are made of fleshRuns up my arm 'til I'm on trackItches the skin right off my backI'll heal your woundsI'll set you freeI'm Jesus Christ on ecstasyHow does it feel?Suck, suck, suckHow does it feel?Suck, suck, suckHow does it feel?Suck, suck, suckHow does it feel?Suck, suck, suckHow does it feel?Suck, suck, suckHow does it feel?Suck, suck, suck
