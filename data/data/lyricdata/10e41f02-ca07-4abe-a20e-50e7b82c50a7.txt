Well, my daddy left home when I was threeAnd he didn't leave much to Ma and meJust this ole guitar and an empty bottle of boozeNow, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hidBut the meanest thing that he ever didWas before he left, he went and named me SueWell, he musta thought that it was quite a jokeAnd it got a lot of laughs from lots a folksSeems I had to fight my whole life throughSome gal would giggle and I'd get redAnd some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his headI'll tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named SueWell, I grew up quick and I grew up meanMy fist got hard and my wits got keenI roamed from town to town to hide my shameBut I made me a vow to the Moon and starsI'd search the honky-tonks and barsAnd kill that man that give me that awful nameWell, it was Gatlinburg in mid-JulyAnd I'd just hit town and my throat was dryI thought I'd stop and have myself a brewAt an old saloon on a street of mudThere at a table dealin' studSat the dirty, mangey dog that named me SueWell I knew that snake was my own sweet dadFrom a worn out picture that my mother hadAnd I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eyeHe was big and bent and grey and oldAnd I looked at him and my blood ran cold, and I said"My name is Sue!  How do you do?  Now you gonna die!"Yeah!  That's what I told himWell, I hit him hard right between the eyesAnd he went down but to my surpriseCame up with a knife an' cut off a piece of my earI busted a chair right across his teethAnd we crashed through the wall and into the streetKickin' and a-gougin' in the mud and the blood and the beerI tell ya, I've fought tougher menBut I really can't remember whenHe kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodileWell, I heard him laugh and then I heard him cussHe went for his gun but I pulled mine firstHe stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smileAnd he said, "Son, this world is roughAnd if a man's gonna make it he's gotta be toughAnd I know I wouldn't be there to help you alongSo I gave you that name and I said goodbyeI knew you'd have to get tough or dieAnd it's that name that helped to make you strong"Yeah!  He said, "Now you just fought one hell of a fightAnd I know you hate me and ya got the rightTo kill me now and I wouldn't blame you if you doBut you oughta thank me before I dieFor the gravel in your guts and the spit in the eye'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue"Yeah, what could I do?  What could I do?I got all choked up and threw down my gunCalled him my Pa and he called me his sonAnd I come away with a different point of viewAnd I think about him now and thenEvery time I try and every time I winAnd if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name himBill or George, any-damn-thing but Sue!  I still hate that name!
