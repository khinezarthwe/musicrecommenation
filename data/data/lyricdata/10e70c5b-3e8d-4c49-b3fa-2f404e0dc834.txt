I once knew a girl in the years of my youthWith eyes like the summer: all beauty and truthBut in the morning I fled, left a note and it read“Someday you will be loved”And I cannot pretend that I felt any regret‘Cause each broken heart will eventually mendJust as the blood runs red down the needle and threadSomeday you will be lovedYou’ll be loved, you’ll be lovedLike you never have knownAnd the memories of me will seem more like bad dreamsJust a series of blurs: like I never occurredAnd someday you will be lovedYou may feel alone when you’re falling asleepAnd every time tears roll down your cheeksBut I know your heart belongs to someone you’ve yet to meetAnd someday you will be lovedYou’ll be loved, you’ll be lovedLike you never have knownAnd the memories of me will seem more like bad dreamsJust a series of blurs: like I never occurredAnd someday you will be lovedYou’ll be loved, you’ll be lovedLike you never have knownAnd the memories of me will seem more like bad dreamsJust a series of blurs: like I never occurredAnd someday you will be lovedAnd someday you will be loved
