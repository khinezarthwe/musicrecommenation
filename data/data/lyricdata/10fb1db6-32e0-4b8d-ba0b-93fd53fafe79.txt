Why do I listen to sad songs?To make me feel goodWhen I know I've done wrongWhat have I done wrong?Is it in this song?I'll guess I'll know before too longBut I can't understandWhy she's holding my handNo I can't understand at allI'm waiting for the heartaches to comeI'm waiting for the heartaches to comeThere's nowhere that I can possibly runI'm waiting for the heartaches to comeGot to keep on holding onAnother day and I'll try to hideThe endless pain and the tears I've criedIt feels like I'm fixin to dieShe took my soul and she blew my mindBut I can't understandWhy she's holding my handNo I can't understand at allI'm waiting for the heartaches to comeI'm waiting for the heartaches to comeThere's nowhere that I can possibly runI'm waiting for the heartaches to comeGot to keep on holding on for youBut I can't understandWhy she's holding my handNo I can't understand at allI'm waiting for the heartaches to comeI'm waiting for the heartaches to comeThere's nowhere that I can possibly runI'm waiting for the heartaches to comeI'm waiting for the heartaches to comeI'm waiting for the heartaches to comeThere's nowhere that I can possibly runI'm waiting for the heartaches to come
