I'm bringing back ghosts that are no longer thereI'm gettin' hard on myself, sittin' in my easy chairWell, there's three people in the mirrorAnd I'm wonderin' which one of them I should chooseWell, I can't keep from laughin'Spittin' out these 300 mile per hour outpour bluesI'm breakin' my teeth off tryin' to bite my lipThere's all kinds of red-headed women that I ain't supposed to kissAnd it's that color which never fails to turn me blueSo I just swallow it and hold on to itAnd use it to scare the hell out of youI have a woman, saysAnd I'm wonderin' just how I can do that,And still give her everything that she needs.Well, there's three people in my head that have the answerAnd one of them's got to be youBut you're holding tight to it, the answerSingin' these 300 mile per hour outpour bluesPut on gloves, a tied scarf, and wrap up warm on this winter nightEvery time you get defensive, you're just looking for a fightIt's safe to say somebody out there's got a problem with almost anything you'll doWell, next time they stab you, don't fight backJust play the victim instead of playin' the foolAnd the roads are covered with a million little moleculesOf cigarette ashes and the school floors are coveredWith pieces of pencil eraser, tooWell, sooner or later, the ground's gonna be holdin' all of my ashes, tooBut I can't help but wonder if after I'm goneWill I still have these 300 mile per hour, finger breaking,No answers, broken back, dirty cancer, bee stung and busted upEmpty cup torrential outpour blues?One thing's for sure in that graveyardI'm gonna have the shiniest pair of shoes
