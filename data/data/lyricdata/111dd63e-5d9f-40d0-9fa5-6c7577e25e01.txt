They love you or they hate youBut they will never let you beThey thrill you or sedate youBut they will never let you seeIn the evening sunEncourage and derange youWatch you walking scared alongDespite intimidationPleased to watch you dance aloneIn the evening sunGo your seperate way nowSomeday you'll come backAnd I'll be dreaming I was sunburnedI don't wanna break your heart inBreak your heart in two halvesKeep one half and give one half to meI like the summer, miss the summerTell me, what'd you do?Nothing?Me tooOh, actors they're pretendingAnd singers they will sometimes lieOh, kids are always honest'Cause they don't think they're ever gonna dieYou're the prettiest smartest captain of the teamI love you more than being seventeenIn the evening sun
