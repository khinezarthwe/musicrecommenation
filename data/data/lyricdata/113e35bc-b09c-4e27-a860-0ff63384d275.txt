They slapped them on you Where that bracelet used to be You know the one I bought you in phoenix Where they sell old jewellery I was trying to make you angry But I didn't feed you to the cops When I threw that drink in that guy's face It was just to piss you off' Cause, honey, it's over It's harder now that it's over It's harder now that it's over Now that the cuffs are off And you're free You're free with a history I heard your wrists got bruised Must've felt just like old times I wish you would've grabbed the gun And shot me 'cause I died And I'm nothing now without youyeah, I'm less than nothing now I'm the one between the bars And lost forever now' Cause it's over now It's harder now that it's over It's harder now that it's over Now that the cuffs are off And you're free You're free with a history Free with a history You're free Free with a history I'm sorry
