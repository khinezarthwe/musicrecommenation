They slapped them on youWhere that bracelet used to beYou know the one I bought you in phoenixWhere they sell old jewelleryI was trying to make you angryBut I didn't feed you to the copsWhen I threw that drink in that guy's faceIt was just to piss you off'Cause, honey, it's overIt's harder now that it's overIt's harder now that it's overNow that the cuffs are offAnd you're freeYou're free with a historyI heard your wrists got bruisedMust've felt just like old timesI wish you would've grabbed the gunAnd shot me 'cause I diedAnd I'm nothing now without youyeah, I'm less than nothing nowI'm the one between the barsAnd lost forever now'Cause it's over nowIt's harder now that it's overIt's harder now that it's overNow that the cuffs are offAnd you're freeYou're free with a historyFree with a historyYou're freeFree with a historyI'm sorry
