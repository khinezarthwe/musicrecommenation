Where were you when I fell from grace?Frozen heart, an empty spaceSomething's changing, it's in your eyesPlease don't speak, you'll only lieI found treasure not where I thoughtPeace of mind can't be boughtStill I believeJust hang on, suffer wellSometimes it's hard, it's hard to tellAn angel led me when I was blindI said, "Take me back, I've changed my mind"Now I believeFrom the blackest room, I was tornHe called my name, a love was bornSo I believeJust hang on, suffer wellSometimes it's hard, it's hard to tellJust hang on, suffer wellSometimes it's hard, so hard to tell
