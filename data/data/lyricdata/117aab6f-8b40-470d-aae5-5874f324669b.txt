How can I just let you walk awayJust let you leave without a traceWhen I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh-oohYou're the only one who really knew me at allHow can you just walk away from meWhen all I can do is watch you leave'Cause we've shared the laughter and the painAnd even shared the tearsYou're the only one who really knew me at allSo take a look at me nowWell there's just an empty spaceAnd there's nothing left here to remind meJust the memory of your faceWell take a look at me nowWell there's just an empty spaceAnd you coming back to me is against the oddsAnd that's what I've got to faceI wish I could just make you turn aroundTurn around and see me cryThere's so much I need to say to youSo many reasons whyYou're the only one who really knew me at allSo take a look at me nowWell there's just an empty spaceAnd there's nothing left here to remind meJust the memory of your faceNow take a look at me now'Cause there's just an empty spaceBut to wait for you is all I can doAnd that's what I've got to faceTake a good look at me now'Cause I'll still be standing hereAnd you coming back to me is against all oddsIt's the chance I've got to takeTake a look at me now
