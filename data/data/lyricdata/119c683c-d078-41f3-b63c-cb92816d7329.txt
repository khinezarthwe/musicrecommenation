Here I layStill and breathlessJust like alwaysStill I want some moreMirrors sidewaysWho cares what's behindJust like alwaysStill your passengerThe chrome buttons, buckles onLeather surfacesThese and otherLucky witnessesNow to calm meThis time won't you pleaseDrive fasterRoll the window downThis cool night air is curiousLet the whole world look inWho cares who sees anything?I'm your passengerI'm your passengerDrop these downThen put them on meNice cool seats thereTo cushion your kneesNow to calm meTake me around againDon't pull overThis time won't you pleaseDrive fasterRoll the window downThis cool night air is curiousLet the whole world look inWho cares who sees what tonight?Roll these misty windowsDown to catch my breath againGo and go and don't justDrive me home then back againHere I layJust like alwaysDon't let me goGo, go, go, goGo, go, go, goTake me to the end
