Nothing unusual, nothing strangeClose to nothing at allThe same old scenario, the same old rainAnd there's no explosions hereThen something unusual, something strangeComes from nothing at allI saw a spaceship fly by your windowDid you see it disappear?Amie come sit on my wallAnd read me the story of "O"And tell it like you still believeThat the end of the centuryBrings a change for you and meNothing unusual, nothing's changedJust a little older that's allYou know when you've found it,There's something I've learned'Cause you feel it when they take it awaySomething unusual, something strangeComes from nothing at allBut I'm not a miracle and you're not a saintJust another soldier on the road to nowhereAmie come sit on my wallAnd read me the story of "O"And tell it like you still believeThat the end of the centuryBrings a change for you and meAnd Amie come sit on my wallAnd read me the story of "O"And tell it like you still believeThat the end of the centuryBrings a change for you and me
