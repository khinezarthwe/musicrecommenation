Here's to us one more toast and then we'll pay the billDeep inside both of us can feel the autumn chillBirds of passage, you and meWe fly instinctivelyWhen the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sunNeither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and doneIn our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treksSlightly worn but dignified and not too old for sexWe're still striving for the skyNo taste for humble pieThanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the funNeither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and doneIt's so strange when you're down and lying on the floorHow you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for moreClear-headed and open-eyedWith nothing left untriedStanding calmly at the crossroads,no desire to runThere's no hurry any more when all is said and doneStanding calmly at the crossroads, no desire to runThere's no hurry any more when all is said and done
