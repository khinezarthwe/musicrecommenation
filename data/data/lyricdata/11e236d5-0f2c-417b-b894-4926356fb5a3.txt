In a pearl grey room one afternoonIn one afternoon what are you going to do?I hang on your words but there's nothing newYou take a beautiful thingPull off a wing, pull off a wingThe safety pinIt never shines quite as bright againBut you haven't told me anythingThat I didn't already knowNo you haven't said a single thingThat I didn't already knowEverything I love is stuck in the mudStuck in the mud, stuck in a rutNot a piece in your puzzle or a paper cutSo same time next weekKiss on the cheek, kiss on the cheekAnd say after meEverything's tied up nice and neatBut you haven't told me anythingThat I didn't already knowNo you haven't sold me anythingThat I didn't already ownI feel for you, I really doNothing adds up like you want it toNo words can mend this fix I'm inGive me your worst, I won't even blinkRight between the eyes, I won't feel a thingBecause you haven't told me anythingThat I didn't already knowNo you haven't said a single thingThat I didn't already knowNo you haven't told me anything
