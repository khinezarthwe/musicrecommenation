In a pearl grey room one afternoon In one afternoon what are you going to do? I hang on your words but there's nothing new You take a beautiful thing Pull off a wing, pull off a wing The safety pin It never shines quite as bright again But you haven't told me anything That I didn't already know No you haven't said a single thing That I didn't already know Everything I love is stuck in the mud Stuck in the mud, stuck in a rut Not a piece in your puzzle or a paper cut So same time next week Kiss on the cheek, kiss on the cheek And say after me Everything's tied up nice and neat But you haven't told me anything That I didn't already know No you haven't sold me anything That I didn't already own I feel for you, I really do Nothing adds up like you want it to No words can mend this fix I'm in Give me your worst, I won't even blink Right between the eyes, I won't feel a thing Because you haven't told me anything That I didn't already know No you haven't said a single thing That I didn't already know No you haven't told me anything
