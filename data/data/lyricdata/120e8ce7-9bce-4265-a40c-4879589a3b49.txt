I'm no Barbie dollI'm not your baby girlI've done ugly thingsAnd I have made mistakesAnd I am not as pretty as those girls in magazinesI am rotten to my core if they're to be believedSo what if I'm no baby bird hanging upon your every wordNothing ever smells of roses that rises out of mudWhy do you love me?Why do you love me?Why do you love me?It's driving me crazyWhy do you love me?Why do you love me?Why do you love me?It's driving me crazyYou're not some little boyWhy you acting so surprised?You're sick of all the rulesWell I'm sick of all your liesNow I've held back a wealth of shitI think I'm gonna chokeI'm standing in the shadowsWith the words stuck in my throatDoes it really come as a surpriseWhen I tell you I don't feel goodThat nothing ever came from nothing, manOh, man, ain't that the truthWhy do you love me?Why do you love me?Why do you love me?It's driving me crazyI get back up and I do it againGet back up and I do it againGet back up and I do it againGet back up and I do itDo it againI think you're sleeping with a friend of mineI have no proofBut I think that I'm rightYou still got the most beautiful faceIt just makes me sadMost of the timeI get back up and I do it againGet back up and I do it againGet back up and I do it againGet back up and I do itDo it againDo it againDo it againDo it againWhy do you love me?Why do you love me?Why do you love me?It's driving me crazy
