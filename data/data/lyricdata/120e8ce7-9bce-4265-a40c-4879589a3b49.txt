I'm no Barbie doll I'm not your baby girl I've done ugly things And I have made mistakes And I am not as pretty as those girls in magazines I am rotten to my core if they're to be believed So what if I'm no baby bird hanging upon your every word Nothing ever smells of roses that rises out of mud Why do you love me? Why do you love me? Why do you love me? It's driving me crazy Why do you love me? Why do you love me? Why do you love me? It's driving me crazy You're not some little boy Why you acting so surprised? You're sick of all the rules Well I'm sick of all your lies Now I've held back a wealth of shit I think I'm gonna choke I'm standing in the shadows With the words stuck in my throat Does it really come as a surprise When I tell you I don't feel good That nothing ever came from nothing, man Oh, man, ain't that the truth Why do you love me? Why do you love me? Why do you love me? It's driving me crazy I get back up and I do it again Get back up and I do it again Get back up and I do it again Get back up and I do it Do it again I think you're sleeping with a friend of mine I have no proof But I think that I'm right You still got the most beautiful face It just makes me sad Most of the time I get back up and I do it again Get back up and I do it again Get back up and I do it again Get back up and I do it Do it again Do it again Do it again Do it again Why do you love me? Why do you love me? Why do you love me? It's driving me crazy
