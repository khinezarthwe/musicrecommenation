Well, you wonder why I always dress in blackWhy you never see bright colors on my backAnd why does my appearance seem to have a somber toneWell, there's a reason for the things that I have onI wear the black for the poor and the beaten downLivin' in the hopeless, hungry side of townI wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crimeBut is there because he's a victim of the timeI wear the black for those who've never readOr listened to the words that Jesus saidAbout the road to happiness through love and charityWhy, you'd think He's talkin' straight to you and meWell, we're doin' mighty fine, I do supposeIn our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothesBut just so we're reminded of the ones who are held backUp front there ought to be a Man in BlackI wear it for the sick and lonely oldFor the reckless ones whose bad trip left them coldI wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have beenEach week we lose a hundred fine young menAnd I wear it for the thousands who have diedBelievin' that the Lord was on their sideI wear it for another hundred thousand who have diedBelievin' that we all were on their sideWell, there's things that never will be right I knowAnd things need changin' everywhere you goBut 'til we start to make a move to make a few things rightYou'll never see me wear a suit of whiteAh, I'd love to wear a rainbow every dayAnd tell the world that everything's okayBut I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my backTill things are brighter, I'm the Man in Black
