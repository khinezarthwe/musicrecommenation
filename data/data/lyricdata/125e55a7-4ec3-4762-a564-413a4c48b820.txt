We were born to sin, we were born to sinWe don't think we're special, sir, we know everybody isWe've built too many walls, yeah, we've built too many wallsAnd now we gotta run, a giant fist is out to crush usWe run in the dark, we run in the darkWe don't carry dead weight long, we send them along to heavenI carry my baby, I carry my babyHer eyes can barely see, her mouth can barely breatheI can see she's afraidShe could see the dangerWe don't want to die or apologizeFor our dirty God, our dirty bodiesNow I stick to the ground, I stick to the groundI won't look twice for the dead walls, I don't want a white pillar of saltI carry my baby, I carry my babyHer eyes can barely see, her mouth can barely breatheI can see she's afraidThat's why we're escapingSo we won't have to die, we won't have to denyOur dirty God, our dirty bodies
