We sail tonight for Singapore, we're all as mad as hatters hereI've fallen for a tawny Moor, took off to the land of NodDrank with all the Chinamen, walked the sewers of ParisI danced along a colored wind, dangled from a rope of sandYou must say goodbye to meWe sail tonight for Singapore, don't fall asleep while you're ashoreCross your heart and hope to die when you hear the children cryLet marrow, bone, and cleaver choose while making feet for children shoesThrough the alley, back from hell, when you hear that steeple bellYou must say goodbye to meWipe him down with gasoline'Till his arms are hard and meanFrom now on boys, this iron boat's your homeSo heave away, boysWe sail tonight for Singapore, take your blankets from the floorWash your mouth out by the door, the whole town's made of iron oreEvery witness turns to steam, they all become Italian dreamsFill your pockets up with earth, get yourself a dollar's worthAway boys, away boys, heave awayThe captain is a one-armed dwarfHe's throwing dice along the wharfIn the land of the blind the one-eyed man is kingSo take this ringWe sail tonight for Singapore, we're all as mad as hatters hereI've fallen for a tawny Moor, took off to the land of NodDrank with all the Chinamen, walked the sewers of ParisI drank along a colored wind, I dangled from a rope of sandYou must say goodbye to me
