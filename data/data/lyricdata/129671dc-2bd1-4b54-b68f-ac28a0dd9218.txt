Who is the man I seeWhere I'm supposed to be?I lost my heartI buried it too deepUnder the iron seaOh crystal ball, crystal ball save us allTell me life is beautifulMirror, mirror on the wallLines ever more unclearNot sure I'm even hereThe more I look the more I think that I'mStarting to disappearOh crystal ball, crystal ball save us allTell me life is beautifulMirror, mirror on the wallOh crystal ball hear my songI'm fading outEverything I know is wrongSo put me where I belongI don't know where I amAnd I don't really careI look myself in the eyeThere's no one thereI fall upon the earthI call upon the airBut all I get is the same old vacant stareOh crystal ball, crystal ball save us allTell me life is beautifulMirror, mirror on the wallOh crystal ball hear my songI'm fading outEverything I know is wrongSo put me where I belong
