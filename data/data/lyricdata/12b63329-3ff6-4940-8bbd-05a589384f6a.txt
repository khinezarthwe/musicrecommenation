Console me in my darkest hourConvince me that the truth is always grayCaress me in your velvet chairConceal me from the ghosts you cast awayI ain't in no hurryYou go run and tell your friends I'm losin' touchFill their heads with rumors of impending doomIt must be trueConsole me in my darkest hourAnd tell me that you always hear my criesI wonder what you've got conspiredI'm sure it dawns a consolation prizeI ain't in no hurryYou go run and tell your friends I'm losin' touchFill the night with stories, the legend growsOf how you got lostBut you made your way back homeYou sold your soul like a roamin' vagabond, yeahI heard you found a wishing wellIn the cityConsole me in my darkest hourThen you throw me downI ain't in no hurryYou go run and tell your friends I'm losin' touchFill your crown with rumorsImpending doom, it must be trueBut you made your way back homeYou sold your soul like a roamin' vagabondHearing about how you got lost, but you made your way back homeYou went and sold your soul, an allegiance dead and goneI'm losing touch
