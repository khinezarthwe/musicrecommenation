I'm starting to feelWe stay together out of fear of dying aloneI've been slipping through the yearsMy old clothes don't fit like they once didSo they hang like ghosts of the people I've beenIt's like my heart can't be tamedAnd I fall in love every day and I feel like a foolI have to face the truthThat no one could ever look at me like you doLike I'm something worth holding on toAnd there's times I think of leavingBut it's something I'll never do'Cause you can do better than meBut I can't do better than youYou can do better than meBut I can't do better than you
