Mama told meWhen I was youngCome sit beside meMy only sonAnd listen closelyTo what I sayAnd if you do this it'll help you some sunny day (Oh yeah)Oh take your timeDon't live too fastTroubles will comeAnd they will passGo find a womanAnd you'll find loveAnd don't forget son, there is someone up aboveAnd be a simple kind of manOh be somethin' you love and understandBaby be a simple kind of manOh won't you do this for me son, if you can?Forget your lustFor the rich man's goldAll that you needIs in your soulAnd you can do thisIf you tryAll that I want for you my son, is to be satisfiedAnd be a simple kind of manOh be somethin' you love and understandBaby be a simple kind of manOh won't you do this for me son, if you can? (Oh yes I will)Boy don't you worryYou'll find yourselfFollow your heartAnd nothing elseAnd you can do this, oh babe, if you tryAll that I want for you my son, is to be satisfiedAnd be a simple kind of manOh be somethin' you love and understandBaby be a simple kind of manOh won't you do this for me son, if you can?Baby be a simple, be a simple manOh be somethin' you love and understand...
