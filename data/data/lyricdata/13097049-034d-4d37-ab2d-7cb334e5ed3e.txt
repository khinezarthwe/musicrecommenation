I kissed the kids at noonThen stumbled out of the roomI caught a cab, ran up a tab on 7th & FlowerBeth's recital I had to runMissed my son's graduationPunched the Nichols boy for taking his seatHe gets all that anger from meStill, things could be much worseNatural disasters on the evening newsStill, things could be much worseWe've still got our healthMy paycheck in the mailI promised to my wife and childrenI'd never touch another drink as long as I liveBut even then it sounds so soothingThis will blow over in timeThis will all blow over in timeI'm just an honest manProvide for me and mineI give a check to tax deductible charity organizationsTwo weeks paid vacation won't heal the damage doneI need another oneStill, things could be much worseNatural disasters on the evening newsStill, things could be much worseWe've still got our healthMy paycheck in the mailI promised to my wife and childrenI'd never touch another drink as long as I liveBut even then it sounds so soothingTo mix a gin and sink into oblivionI promised to my wife and childrenThat accident left everyone a little shook upBut at the meetings I felt so emptyThis will blow over in timeThis will all blow over in time
