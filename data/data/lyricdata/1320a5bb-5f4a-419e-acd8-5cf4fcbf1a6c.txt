My friend and me Looking through her red box of memories Faded, I'm sure But love seems to stick in her veins, you know Yes, there's love if you want it Don't sound like no sonnet, my Lord Yes, there's love if you want it Don't sound like no sonnet, my Lord My Lord Why can't you see That nature has it's way of warning me Eyes open wide Looking at the heavens with a tear in my eye Yes, there's love if you want it Don't sound like no sonnet, my Lord Yes, there's love if you want it Don't sound like no sonnet, my Lord My Lord Sinking faster than a boat without a hull My Lord Dreaming 'bout the day when I can see you there My side By my side Here we go again and my head is gone, my Lord I stopped to say hello' Cause I think you should know, by now By now By now By now By now By now Oh, by now Oh, by now Oh, by now Oh, by now Oh, by now Oh, by now Oh, by now Oh, by now
