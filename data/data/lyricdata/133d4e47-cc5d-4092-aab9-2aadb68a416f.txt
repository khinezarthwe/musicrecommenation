I'm not such a good loverI'm a better talkerSo when you touch me thereI'm scared that you'll seeNot the way that I don't love youBut the way that I don't love myselfThere are things these daysThat can help you through a phaseLike food and health and fearI prefer the beerNot the way that I don't love youBut the way that I hate myselfOh when the cityscape is bornFrom the ocean floorIt speaks its native tonguePhysical, subliminalNot the way that it left you coldBut the way that you left yourselfAnd the Moon falls from the EarthAnd the Sun, it fills its girthAnd I know we'll go howl at the nightOh, howl at the nightBut still the sun will not hide our fightOh, hide our fightI laugh a lotBut that's just a plotI found a way to make the night stayNot the way that I don't love youBut the way that I hate myselfIt was OprahOn the TV showShe told me soIt was OprahOn the TV showShe told me soNot the way that I don't love youBut the way that I love myself
