Looking out the door I see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners Parading in a wake of sad relations As their shoes fill up with water Maybe I'm too young To keep good love from going wrong But tonight, you're on my mind so You never know Broken down and hungry for your love With no way to feed it Where are you tonight? Child, you know how much I need it. Too young to hold on And too old to just break free and run Sometimes a man gets carried away, When he feels like he should be having his fun Much too blind to see the damage he's done Sometimes a man must awake to find that, really, He has no-one... So I'll wait for you... And I'll burn Will I ever see your sweet return? Oh, will I ever learn? Oh, Lover, you should've come over Cause it's not too late. Lonely is the room the bed is made The open window lets the rain in Burning in the corner is the only one Who dreams he had you with him My body turns and yearns for a sleep That won't ever come It's never over, My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder It's never over,all my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her... It's never over, All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter... It's never over, She's a tear that hangs inside my soul forever... But maybe I'm just too young to keep good love From going wrong Oh... lover you should've come over... Yes, and I feel too young to hold on I'm much too old to break free and run Too deaf, dumb, and blind To see the damage I've done Sweet lover, you should've come over Oh, love, well I'll wait for you Lover, you should've come over' Cause it's not too late.
