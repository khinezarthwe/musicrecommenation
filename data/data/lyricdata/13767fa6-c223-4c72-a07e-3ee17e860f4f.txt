Looking out the doorI see the rain fall upon the funeral mournersParading in a wake of sad relationsAs their shoes fill up with waterMaybe I'm too youngTo keep good love from going wrongBut tonight, you're on my mind soYou never knowBroken down and hungry for your loveWith no way to feed itWhere are you tonight?Child, you know how much I need it.Too young to hold onAnd too old to just break free and runSometimes a man gets carried away,When he feels like he should be having his funMuch too blind to see the damage he's doneSometimes a man must awake to find that, really,He has no-one...So I'll wait for you... And I'll burnWill I ever see your sweet return?Oh, will I ever learn?Oh, Lover, you should've come overCause it's not too late.Lonely is the room the bed is madeThe open window lets the rain inBurning in the corner is the only oneWho dreams he had you with himMy body turns and yearns for a sleepThat won't ever comeIt's never over,My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulderIt's never over,all my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her...It's never over,All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter...It's never over,She's a tear that hangs inside my soul forever...But maybe I'm just too young to keep good loveFrom going wrongOh... lover you should've come over...Yes, and I feel too young to hold onI'm much too old to break free and runToo deaf, dumb, and blindTo see the damage I've doneSweet lover, you should've come overOh, love, well I'll wait for youLover, you should've come over'Cause it's not too late.
