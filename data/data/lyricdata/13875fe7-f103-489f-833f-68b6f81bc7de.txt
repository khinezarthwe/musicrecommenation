Your defenses were on highYour walls built deep insideYeah I'm a selfish bastardBut at least I'm not aloneMy intentions never changeWhat I want it stays the sameAnd I know what I should doIt's time to set myself on fireWas it a dream?Was it a dream?Is this the only evidence that proves itA photograph of you and IYour reflection I've erasedLike a thousand burned out yesterdaysBelieve me when I say "goodbye forever"It's for goodWas it a dream?Was it a dream?Is this the only evidence that proves itA photograph of you and IWhoa yeah! Whoa...Was it a dream?Was it a dream?Is this the only evidence that proves itA photograph of you and I(A photograph of you and I)Was it a dream?Was it a dream?Is this the only evidence that proves itA photograph of you and IA photograph of you and IA photograph of you and I... In love...
