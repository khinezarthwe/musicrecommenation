I have become a silent movie The hero killed the clown Can't make a sound, can't make a sound Can't make a sound Nobody knows what he's doing Still hanging 'round Can't make a sound, can't make a sound Can't make a sound Can't make a sound The slow motion moves me The monologue means nothing to me( Ahh) Bored in the role but he can't stop Standing up to sit back down Or lose the one thing found Spinning the world like a toy top' Til there's a ghost in every town Can't make a sound, can't make a sound Can't make a sound Can't make a sound Eyes locked and shining Can't you tell me what's happening? Why should you want any other When you're a world within a world? Why should you want any other When you're a world within a world? Why should you want any other When you're a world within a world? Why should you want any other When you're a world within a world? Why should you want any other When you're a world within a world?
