I have become a silent movieThe hero killed the clownCan't make a sound, can't make a soundCan't make a soundNobody knows what he's doingStill hanging 'roundCan't make a sound, can't make a soundCan't make a soundCan't make a soundThe slow motion moves meThe monologue means nothing to me(Ahh)Bored in the role but he can't stopStanding up to sit back downOr lose the one thing foundSpinning the world like a toy top'Til there's a ghost in every townCan't make a sound, can't make a soundCan't make a soundCan't make a soundEyes locked and shiningCan't you tell me what's happening?Why should you want any otherWhen you're a world within a world?Why should you want any otherWhen you're a world within a world?Why should you want any otherWhen you're a world within a world?Why should you want any otherWhen you're a world within a world?Why should you want any otherWhen you're a world within a world?
