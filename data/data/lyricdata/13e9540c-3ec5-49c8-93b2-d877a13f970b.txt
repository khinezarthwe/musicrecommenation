The mind is gray like the cityPacking in and overgrownLove is deep, dig it outStanding in a hole aloneWorking for somethingThat one can never holdA place in the cloudsGood place to hide, oh my ohSo I'm flying away, awayDriving away, awayFinding hope in ways I missed beforeI missed beforeThe TV, she talks to meBreaking news and building wallsSelling me what I don't needI never knew soap made you tallerSo I'm gliding away, awayHiding away, awaySo much talk it makes no sense at allMy senses have gone, AWOL, AWOL, AWOL, AWOL, AWOLSo I'm hiding away, awayDriving away, awayPassing new friends I won't know at allWon't know at allIt doesn't hurt when I bleedBut my memories they eat meI've seen it all beforeBring it on, 'cause I'm no victimDyingDyingDyingDying
