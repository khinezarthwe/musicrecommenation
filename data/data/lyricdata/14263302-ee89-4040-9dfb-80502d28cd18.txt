"The WizardHe was a wizard of a thousand kingsAnd I chanced to meet him one night wanderingHe told me tales and he drank my wineMe and my magic man kinda feelin' fineHe had a cloak of gold and eyes of fireAnd as he spoke I felt the deep desireTo free the world of its fear and painAnd help the people to feel free againWhy don't we listen to the voices in our hearts'Cause then I know we'd find we're not so far apartEverybody's got to be happy, everyone should singFor we know the joy of life, the peace that love can bringSo spoke the wizard in his mountain homeThe vision of his wisdom means we'll never be aloneAnd I will dream of my magic nightAnd the million silver stars that guide me with their light"
