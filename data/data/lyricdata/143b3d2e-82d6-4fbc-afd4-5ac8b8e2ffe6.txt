Sometimes I think this cycle never endsWe slide from top to bottom and we turn and climb againAnd it seems by the time that I have figured what it's worthThe squeaking of our skin against the steel has gotten worseBut if I move my place in line, I'll loseAnd I have waited, the anticipation's got me gluedI am waiting for something to go wrongI am waiting for familiar resolveSometimes it seems that I don't have the skills to recollectThe twists and turns of plot that turned us from lovers to friendsI'm thinking I should take that volume back up off the shelfAnd crack its weary spine and read to help remind myselfBut if I move my place in line, I'll loseAnd I have waited, the anticipation's got me gluedI am waiting for something to go wrongI am waiting for familiar resolveI am waiting for another repeatAnother diet fed by crippling defeatAnd I am waiting for that sense of reliefI am waiting for you to flee the sceneAs if you held in your hand the smoking gunAnd on the floor laid the one you said you lovedAnd it's strange - they're all basically the sameSo I don't ask names anymoreSometimes I think this cycle never endsWe slide from top to bottom and we turn and climb againAnd it seems by the time that I have figured what its worthThe squeaking of our skin against the steel has gotten worseThe squeaking of our skin against the steel has gotten worseThe squeaking of our skin against the steel has gotten worse
