I lost all of my vanitywhen I peered into the poolI lost all of my innocenceWhen I fell in love with youI never knew a man fall so far until I landed hereWhere all of my wounds turn into gold when I kissed your hairCome to me HannahHannah won't you to come on to meI'll lay down this bottle of wineIf you'll just be kind to meAsk her why she cries so loudShe Will not say a wordEyes like ice and hands that shakeShe takes what she deservesTo celebrate her emptinessIn a Cold and lonely roomSweep the floor with your long flowered dressIf you cannot find a broomCome to me HannahHannah won't you come on to meI'll lay down this bottle of wineIf you'll just be kind to meShe's got hair that flows right downRight down to the backs of her kneesHer Papa he was a preaching manAnd the lord is hard to pleaseSo she comes down from the ozark hills to these very streets to roamWith a banjo and a bible and a fine tooth combCome to me HannahHannah won't you come on to meI'll lay down this bottle of wine if you just be kind to meI'd walk one mile on this broken glassto fall down at your feetoh Hannah you're the queen of the streetI climb the tree withy my HannahleeMy intentions they were pureOh the breeze did whip and I lost my gripI tumbled towards the earthWhere You never would guess who it was that stood belowAnd his name I would never tellBut His eyes were clearAnd His arms were strongAnd caught me as I fellNow come to me HannahHannah won't you come on to meI'll lay down this bottle of wineIf you'd just be kind to meI'd walk one mile on broken glassto fall down at your feetHannah you're the queen of the streetHannah you're the queen of the street
