We should shine a light on, a light on And the Book of Right- On's right-on, it was right-on We should shine a light on, a light on And the Book of Right- On's right-on, it was right-on I killed my dinner with karate Kick 'em in the face, taste the body Shallow work is the work that I do Do you want to sit at my table? My fighting fame is fabled And fortune finds me fit and able And you do say, oh, that you do pray, oh, oh And you say that you're okay And do you want to run with my pack? Do you want to ride on my back? Pray that what you lack does not distract And even when you run through my mind Something else is in front, oh, you're behind And I don't have to remind you to stick with your kind And you do say, oh, oh that you do pray, oh, oh And you say that you're okay And even when you touch my face You know your place And even when you touch my face You know your place We should shine a light on, a light on And the Book of Right- On's right-on, it was right-on We should shine a light on, a light on And the Book of Right- On's right-on, it was right-on
