Come into my lifeRegress into a dreamWe will hideAnd build a new realityDraw another pictureOf the life you could have hadFollow your instinctsAnd choose the other pathYou should never be afraidYou're protected from trouble and painWhy, why is this a crisisIn your eyes again?Come to beHow did it come to beTied to a railroadNo love to set us freeWatch our souls fade awayAnd our bodies crumblingDon't be afraidI will take the blow for youAnd I've had recurring nightmaresThat I was loved for who I amAnd missed the opportunityTo be a better man
