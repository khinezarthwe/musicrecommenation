Chimney falls and lovers blazeThought that I was youngNow I've freezing hands and bloodless veinsAs numb as I've becomeI'm so tiredI wish I was the moon tonightLast night I dreamtI had forgotten my name'Cause I had sold my soulBut I woke just the sameI'm so lonelyI wish I was the moon tonightGod blessed me, I'm a free manWith no place free to goI'm paralyzed and collared-tightNo pills for what I fearThis is crazyI wish I was the moon tonightChimney falls as lovers blazeI thought that I was youngNow I've freezing hands and bloodless veinsAs numb as I've becomeI'm so tiredI wish I was the moon tonightHow will you know if you found me at last'Cause I'll be the one, be the one, be the oneWith my heart in my lapI'm so tired, I'm so tiredAnd I wish I was the moon tonightI'm so tired, I'm so tiredAnd I wish I was the moonI'm so tired, I'm so tiredAnd I wish I was the moon tonight
