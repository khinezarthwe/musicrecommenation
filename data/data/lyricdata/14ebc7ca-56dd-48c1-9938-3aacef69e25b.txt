Give me two strong armsTo protect myselfGive me so much loveThat I forget myselfI need to swing from limb to limbTo relieve this mess I'm in'Cause when depression starts to winI need to be right by your sideNo one seems to touch meIn the way you doNothing seems to hurt meWhen I'm close to youI'm so full of desireWhen you set my head on fireI need to be right by your sideEvery single one of us needsLove, love, loveEverybody needs to give and receive loveEvery single day can drag usDown, down, downBut there's nothing left to fearWhen love gets into townI'm so full of desireWhen you set my head on fireI need to be right by your sideGive me two strong armsTo protect myselfGive me so much loveThat I forget myselfI need to swing from limb to limbTo relieve this mess I'm in'Cause when depression starts to winI need to be right by your sideI need to be right by your side
