Here I stand head in handTurn my face to the wallIf she's gone I can't go onFeeling two foot smallEverywhere people stareEach and every dayI can see them laugh at meAnd I hear them sayHey, you've got to hide your love awayHey, you've got to hide your love awayHow can I even try?I can never winHearing them, seeing themIn the state I'm inHow could she say to meLove will find a way?Gather round, all you clownsLet me hear you sayHey, you've got to hide your love awayHey, you've got to hide your love away
