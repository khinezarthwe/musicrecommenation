One, two, three, four, five, six...It's bad enough you ever use the word as an adjectiveBut to suggest we do it in heels is really quite crassAnd frankly, we're reasonably practicalAnd we know the benefits of always doing these things in flatsAnd I spent the last seven years perched on the edge of my bedScratching 'I am incredibly sincere' into my forearmYou should know betterA fifteen year old's editorial, some lazy innuendo(The last man standing is a girl)Four sweaty boys with guitars tell me nothing about my lifeAnd the earth's air pressure gets far greater when I hear youYou should try harderIt takes an educated guess to see I like you little at bestAnd if you come here for the faces hope you leave under duressAnd you still treat it like a noveltyLess pop concert more butcheryAnd we exhale, and roll our eyes in unisonAnd we exhaleAnd we roll our eyesAnd we do these things in unisonAnd woe is meAnd woe is youAnd woe is us, togetherAnd woe is meAnd woe is youAnd woe is us, together.
