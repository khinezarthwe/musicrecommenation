Thinking of youAll through the morningI'm thinking of youAll through the eveningI'm thinking of youAnd the way that your holy water grewI met a girlUnder the waterIt made me recallHow I wanted a daughterBut you never gave meNothing that I could hold on toBut I wrote you letters by the phoneAnd I wrote you every night aloneBut who are you walking around with?ButtercupHe was my lordAnd I was his ladyBut I soon grew tired ofThe lazy daysWhen I moved awayAnd I thought of him oftenHe came to me nightsIn my rose coloured dreamsThinking of youAll through the morningI'm thinking of youAll through the eveningI'm thinking of youAnd the way that your holy water grewBut I wrote you letters by the phoneAnd I wrote you every night aloneBut who are you walking around with?Buttercup
