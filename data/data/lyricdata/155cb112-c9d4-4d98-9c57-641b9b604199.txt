Somebody's shoutingUp at a mountainOnly my own words returnNobody's up thereIt's a deceptionWhen will I ever learn?I'm alone hereWith emptiness, eagles and snowUnfriendliness chilling my bodyAnd whispering pictures of homeWondering blindlyHow can they find me?Maybe they don't even knowMy body is shakingAnticipatingThe call of the black-footed crowI'm alone hereWith emptiness, eagles and snowUnfriendliness chilling my bodyAnd taunting with pictures of homeHere in this prisonOf my own makingYear after day I have grownInto a heroBut there's no worshipWhere have they hidden my throne?I'm alone hereWith emptiness, eagles and snowUnfriendliness chilling my bodyAnd screaming out pictures of home
