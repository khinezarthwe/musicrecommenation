I've been sitting here patiently, I've been talking to myself Trying to shake that sinking feeling, Wishing I was somebody else And I know it's not easy, When you don't get what you deserve You can say that you love me, But that's not what I've heard Tonight in L. A. Tonight in L. A. Well it's got to be that way Tonight in L. A. Maybe I'll get right out of here, All the way back to Turnpike Lane Find me a girl who can calm me right down, It's been such a fucked up year And I know it's not easy, When you don't get what you deserve You can say that you love me, But that's not what I've heard Tonight in L. A. Tonight in L. A. Well it's got to be that way Tonight in L. A. Maybe I'll get myself together, Or fall to pieces and run back home Get me a ticket for an airplane, I'm tired of being alone I was on Mulholland Drive with the radio on, They played Augustus Pablo and the Kings of Leon We sing, we know it's not easy, When you don't get what you deserve And you can say that you love me, But that's not what I've heard Tonight in L. A. Tonight in L. A. Well it's got to be that way Tonight in L. A. I think of you, How we own each other I think of you, Yeah we own each other Own each other Tonight in L. A. Tonight in L. A. Tonight in L. A. Tonight in L. A. Tonight in L. A. Tonight in L. A. Mars and the U. S. A. In fall, and the Milky Way It's got to be that way Kinski's on Broadway Home a million miles away, away, away You've met your match Stars catch your eyes You've tried I'll bet You've met your match You burn like fire I hide your love You trust your nerve You burn like fire I steal I lie I tried the thrill You build me up You steal you lie And love me still Like me you tried You've cried I'll bet You've met your match
