You can burn your paper fingers in the ashtrayPlace your swollen lips on mineYou can shave your heavy head in my carpeted hallwaySure for the first time you're wearing the right clothesNow take them offMeet me on the band room rugTie my right hand to the rideYou can take a live wire into the bath with youFor a feeling you can't findYou can entertain your childhood friends with a tour of the bedroomLaugh to erase the dirt on your mindOh let's move outMeet me at the motelTie my right hand to the bibleToo little too late but we don't say noIt's too much to feelTie my right hand to the bible
