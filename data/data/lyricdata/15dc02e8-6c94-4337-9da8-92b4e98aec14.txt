You could say it's my instinct Yes I still have one There's no time to second guess it And yes, there are things that I'm still so afraid of... But my courage is roaring like the sound of the sun' Cause it's vain about its mane and will reveal them to no one I'm an animal, you're an animal, too Pick up that rock, drink from that lake I do my best but I'm made of mistakes And yes there are things that I'm still quite sure of I love you this hour, this hour today And heaven will smell like the airport (airport) I may never get there to prove it So let's not waste our time thinkin' how that ain't fair I'm an animal, you're an animal, too You're an animal, too
