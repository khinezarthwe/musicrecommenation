You could say it's my instinctYes I still have oneThere's no time to second guess itAnd yes, there are things that I'm still so afraid of...But my courage is roaring like the sound of the sun'Cause it's vain about its mane and will reveal them to no oneI'm an animal, you're an animal, tooPick up that rock, drink from that lakeI do my best but I'm made of mistakesAnd yes there are things that I'm still quite sure ofI love you this hour, this hour todayAnd heaven will smell like the airport (airport)I may never get there to prove itSo let's not waste our time thinkin' how that ain't fairI'm an animal, you're an animal, tooYou're an animal, too
