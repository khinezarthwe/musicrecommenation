Last night, I had a dream about youIn this dream, I'm dancing right beside youAnd it looked like everyone was having funThe kind of feeling I've waited so longDon't stop, come a little closerAs we jam, the rhythm gets strongerThere's nothing wrong with just a little, little funWe were dancing all night longThe time is right to put my arms around youYou're feeling right, you wrap your arms around tooBut suddenly I feel the shining sunBefore I knew it, this dream was all goneOoh, I don't know what to doAbout this dream and youI wish this dream comes trueOoh, I don't know what to doAbout this dream and youWe'll make this dream come trueWhy don't you play the game?Why don't you play the game?
