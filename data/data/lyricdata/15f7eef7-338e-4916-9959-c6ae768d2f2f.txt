You moved like honey in my dream last nightYeah, some old fires were burningYou came near to me and you endeared to meBut you couldn't quite discern meDoes that scare you?I'll let you run awayBut your heart will not oblige youYou'll remember me like a melodyYeah, I'll haunt the world inside youAnd my big secret -- gonna win you overslow like honey, heavy with moodI'll let you see me, I'll covet your regardI'll invade your demeanorAnd you'll yield to me like a scent in the breezeand you'll wonder what it is about meIt's my big secret -- keeping you comingslow like honey, heavy with moodThough dreams can be deceivinglike faces are to heartsthey serve for sweet relievingwhen fantasy and reality lie too far apartSo I stretch myself across, like a bridgeand I pull you to the edgeAnd I stand there waitingtrying to attainthe end to satisfy the storyShall I release you?Must I release you?As I rise to meet my gloryBut my big secret --gonna hover over your lifegonna keep you reachingwhen I'm gone like yesterdaywhen I'm high like heavenwhen I'm strong like musicCause I'm slow like honey, andheavy with mood
