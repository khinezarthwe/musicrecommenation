You moved like honey in my dream last night Yeah, some old fires were burning You came near to me and you endeared to me But you couldn't quite discern me Does that scare you? I'll let you run away But your heart will not oblige you You'll remember me like a melody Yeah, I'll haunt the world inside you And my big secret -- gonna win you overslow like honey, heavy with mood I'll let you see me, I'll covet your regard I'll invade your demeanor And you'll yield to me like a scent in the breezeand you'll wonder what it is about me It's my big secret -- keeping you comingslow like honey, heavy with mood Though dreams can be deceivinglike faces are to heartsthey serve for sweet relievingwhen fantasy and reality lie too far apart So I stretch myself across, like a bridgeand I pull you to the edge And I stand there waitingtrying to attainthe end to satisfy the story Shall I release you? Must I release you? As I rise to meet my glory But my big secret --gonna hover over your lifegonna keep you reachingwhen I'm gone like yesterdaywhen I'm high like heavenwhen I'm strong like music Cause I'm slow like honey, andheavy with mood
