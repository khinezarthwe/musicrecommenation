I'm giving up the ghost of loveAnd a shadow is cast on devotionShe is the one that I adoreQueen of my silent suffocationBreak this bittersweet spell on meLost in the arms of destinyBittersweetI won't give up, I'm possessed by herI'm bearing a cross, she's turned into my curseBreak this bittersweet spell on meLost in the arms of destinyBittersweet, I want youOh, how I wanted youAnd I need youHow I needed youBreak this bittersweet spell on meLost in the arms of destinyBreak this bittersweet spell on meLost in the arms of destinyBittersweet
