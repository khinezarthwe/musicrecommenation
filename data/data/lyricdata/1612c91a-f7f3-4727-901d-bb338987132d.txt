I wish I could eat the saltOff of your lost, faded lipsWe can cap the old timesMake playing only logical harmWe can cap the old linesMake playing that nothing else will changeBut she can read, she can read, she can read, she can read, she's badShe can read, she can read, she can read, she's badOh, she's badBut it's different now that I'm poor and agingI'll never see this face againYou go stabbing yourself in the neckAnd we could find new ways of livingMake playing only logical harmAnd we could top the old timesClay-making that nothing else will changeBut she can read, she can read, she can read, she can read, she's badShe can read, she can read, she can read, she's badOh, she's badIt's different now that I'm poor and agingI'll never see this place againYou go stabbing yourself in the neckBut it's different now that I'm poor and agingI'll never see this place againAnd you'll go stabbing yourself in the neckIt's in the way that she posesIt's in the things that she puts in my hairHer stories are boring and stuffShe's always calling my bluffShe puts it, she puts the weights into my little heartAnd she gets in my room and she takes it apartShe puts the weights into my little heartI said she puts the weights into my little heartShe packs it awayShe packs it awayShe packs it awayShe packs it awayShe packs it awayShe packs it awayShe packs it awayIt's in the way that she walksHer heaven is never enoughShe puts the weights in my heartShe puts it, she puts the weights into my little heart
