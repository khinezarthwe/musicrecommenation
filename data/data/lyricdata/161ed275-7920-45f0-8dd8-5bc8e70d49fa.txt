Before you slip into unconsciousnessI'd like to have another kissAnother flashing chance at blissAnother kissAnother kissThe days are bright and filled with painEnclose me in your gentle rainThe time you ran was too insaneWe'll meet againWe'll meet againOh, tell me where your freedom liesThe streets are fields that never dieDeliver me from reasons whyYou'd rather cryI'd rather flyThe crystal ship is being filledA thousand girls, a thousand thrillsA million ways to spend your timeWhen we get backI'll drop a line
