I've been down hearted babyEver since the day we metI said I've been down hearted babyEver since the day we metOur love is nothing but the blues, womanBaby, how blue can you get?You're evil when I'm with you, babyAnd you're jealous when we're apartI said You're evil when I'm with you, babyAnd you're jealous when we're apartHow blue can you get babyThe answer is right here in my heartI gave you a brand new FordBut you said: I want a CadillacI bought you a ten dollar dinnerAnd you said: thanks for the snackI let you live in my pent houseYou said it just a shackI gave seven childrenAnd now you wanna give them backI said I've been down hearted babyEver since the day we metOur love is nothing but the bluesBaby, how blue can you get?
