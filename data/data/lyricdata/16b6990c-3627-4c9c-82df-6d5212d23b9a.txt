Go away from my windowLeave at your own chosen speedI'm not the one you want, babeI'm not the one you needYou say you're lookin' for someoneWho's never weak but always strongTo protect you and defend youWhether you are right or wrongSomeone to open each and every door.But it ain't me, babeNo, no, no, it ain't me, babeIt ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.Go lightly from the ledge, babeGo lightly on the groundI'm not the one you want, babeI'll only let you downYou say you're lookin' for someoneWho'll promise never to partSomeone to close his eyes to youSomeone to close his heartSomeone to die for you and more.But it ain't me, babeNo, no, no, it ain't me, babeIt ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.You say you're lookin' for someoneTo pick you up each time you fallTo gather flowers constantlyAnd to come each time you callAnd will love you for your lifeAnd nothin' more.But it ain't me, babeNo, no, no, it ain't me, babeIt ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.
