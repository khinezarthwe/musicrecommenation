Although my lover lives in a place that I can't liveI kind of find I like a life this lonelyIt rips and pierces me in places I can't seeI love the rip of nerves, the rip that wakes meSo I'm dissatisfied; I love dissatisfiedI love to feel there's always more that I needSo come on homeSo come on homeSo come on homeHomeYou're where you want to beI'm where I want to beCome on, we're chasing everything we've ever wantedReplace you easily, replace patheticallyI flirt with every flighty thing that falls my wayBut how I needed you, when I needed youLets not forget we are so strong, so bloody strongCome on homeSo come on homeSo come on homeHomeBlue light falls upon your perfect skinFalls and you draw back againFalls and this is how I fellAnd I cannot forgetAnd I cannot forgetCome on homeSo come on homeBut don't forget to leave
