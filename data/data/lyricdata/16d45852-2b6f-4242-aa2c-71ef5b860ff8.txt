He was ready to rock and roll So ready to lose control But when a hungry heart gets a taste of freedom, you better look out He was ready to push and shove Ready to fight for love But I've seen it before, it can make you crazy Yes, the eyes are what you see Why are they watching me? She was ready to black and white The colours were just too bright She loved to fly but she hated falling She was caught in the in between Her dirty would not come clean She ran for light but she got darkness Just when you think you're free The eyes are what you see Why are they watching me? Why do they do the things they do? Why are they watching me? They're watching you Watching you Watching you Watching you If only the eyes could see Then you'd know your destiny The mind is an enemy And you just need a friend Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready to rock and roll Ready to take control If you see the eyes will it make you crazy, crazy, so crazy Why are they watching me? Why do they do the things they do? Why are they watching me? They are watching you Watching you Watching you, you, you Watching you
