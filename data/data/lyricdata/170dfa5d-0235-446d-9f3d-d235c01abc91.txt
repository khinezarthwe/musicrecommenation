Walking on a dreamHow can I explain?Talking to myselfWill I see again?We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of itAlways pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of itOn and on and on we are calling out and out againNever looking down I'm just in awe of what's in front of meIs it real nowWhen two people become one?I can feel itWhen two people become oneThought I'd never seeThe love you found in meNow it's changing all the timeLiving in a rhythm where the minutes working overtimeWe are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of itAlways pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of itOn and on and on we are calling out and out againNever looking down I'm just in awe of what's in front of meIs it real nowWhen two people become one?I can feel itWhen two people become oneIs it real nowWhen two people become one?I can feel itWhen two people become oneCatch me, I'm falling downCatch me, I'm falling downDon't stop, just keep going onI'm your shoulder lean uponSo come on, deliver from insideAll we got is tonight that is right 'till first lightIs it real nowWhen two people become one?I can feel itWhen two people become oneIs it real nowWhen two people become one?I can feel itWhen two people become one
