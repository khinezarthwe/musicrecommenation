2, 3 I I'm as ugly as I seem Worse than all your dreams Could ever make me out to be And It makes me want to scream When it's halloween And the kids are laughing The rogue Is a bank he's never broke But worth as much as a joke That no one is laughing at Can You believe some things are not Appealing and there's a spot? On the ceiling of my childhood bedroom And Can these dreams that you can't imagine But none of them match the vision That you have decided for me You Want to take away from me Things that are mine and it's not your right I'll bet you wouldn't expect a fight, oh Can it be That I don't want what you want? And the only thing I could care for Is a place in a home that is safe and warm Safe and warm, safe and warm, safe and warm Safe Judge Yourself if you feel the need Just let me alone to be In search of the truth myself There Is a drop of blood on the ground And it seems to me that it's not my kind And I can't be sure if it's yours or mine I I'm as ugly as I seem Worse than all your dreams Could ever make me Could ever make me Could ever make me Could ever make me
