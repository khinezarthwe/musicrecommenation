I remember when I saw the sea freezeBut it said nothing of the birds and the beesThat were swarming around my headSinging You'd be better off deadBut I ain't going down like thatNo I ain't going down like thatBecause I'm better than himAnd I know where I've beenAnd I know where I'm comin' fromA lie is a sin, but don't we all sinThat is the truth, and the truth is grimNow he's in jail and his story is for saleThe farmer's dog wags his crippled tailIt points to the West and leaves out the restAnd invites you to be his special guestI remember when I saw the leaves fallI was in the woods, in a gown you wouldn't wear to the ballInto the ditch I fly wanted dead or aliveBut I ain't going down like thatNo I ain't going down like that
