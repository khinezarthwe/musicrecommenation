Cigarettes and chocolate milk These are just a couple of my cravings Everything it seems I like's a little bit stronger A little bit thicker A little bit harmful for me If I should buy jellybeans Have to eat them all in just one sitting Everything it seems I like's a little bit sweeter A little bit fatter A little bit harmful for me And then there's those other things Which for several reasons we won't mention Everything about 'em is a little bit stranger A little bit harder A little bit deadly It isn't very smart Tends to make one part So brokenhearted Sittin' here rememberin' me Always been a shoe made for the city Go ahead accuse me of just singin' about places With scrappy boys' faces Have general run of the town Playing with prodigal sons Takes a lot of sentimental Valiums Can't expect the world to be your Raggedy Andy While running on empty You little old doll with a frown You got to keep in the game Retaining mystique while facing forward I suggest a reading of ' A Lesson in Tightropes' Or ' Surfing Your High Hopes' Or ' Adios, Kansas' It isn't very smart Tends to make one part So brokenhearted Still there's not a show on my back Holes or a friendly intervention I'm just a little bit heiress A little bit Irish A little bit Tower of Pisa whenever I see ya So please be kind If I'm a mess Cigarettes and chocolate milk Cigarettes and chocolate milk
