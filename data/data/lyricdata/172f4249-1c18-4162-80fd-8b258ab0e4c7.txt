Fear ties you upAnd you don't growBeing wrong and lostNo one admits the defeatConscience is fairUnfaithful wordsBetrayal and greedPast thoughts to win aloneEnvy - still strongHatred - still aliveFrom beyond - an empty worldInfected voice - a scream aloneInfected voice!My throat is dryA last cry tries to escapeGuilt and frustrationNo time to turn aroundLooking behind, I'm not aloneAre they friends or enemies?Going insane without a cureScarring my eyes, vision's lostRemorse for the human raceFear of becoming themEnvy: the strongest feelingHatred: still in their heartEnvy - still strongHatred - still aliveFrom beyond - an empty worldInfected voice - a scream aloneInfected voice!
