Bad luck comes in from TampaBad luck comes in from TampaOn the back of a truckDoing ninety up the interstateWe have bad dreams the night he rolls inWe have bad dreams the night he rolls inAnd we tryTo keep our spirits highBut they flag and they waneWhen the truck pulls up out front in the light spring rainAnd they sag like withering flowersLet the good times roll on through these first few desperate hoursThe driver drops his cargo at the curbThe driver drops his cargo at the curbAnd the sun peeks inLike a killer through the curtainAnd when cloven hoof prints turn up in the gardenYeah, when cloven hoof prints turn up in the gardenWe keep up the good fightWe keep our spirits lightBut they drop like fliesAnd there's a stomach-churning shift in the way the land liesAnd they lean like towersOn a hillside, struggling to stand through these first few desperate hours
