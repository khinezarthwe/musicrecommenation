Beat my bones against the wallStaring down an empty hallDeep down in a hollow logComing home like a letter bombCold was the stormThat covered the nightCall a doctor, call a ghostPut a fire into your bonesSic a dog on all you knowCut it loose before you goCold was the stormThat covered the nightWhat makes the soul, the soul of a man?Beat my bones against the wallPut a bank note on your bondGris Gris and a goldenrodDown deep in a hollow logCold was the stormThat buried the nightWhat makes the soul, the soul of a man?
