Take your handAnd place it in my pocketFlick your eyes back in their socketsPut those thoughts awaySometimes they're much to loudI'll take a breathAnd cradle your sweet headShould've stayed at home in bedPut that face awayI'm melting for youI know, I get coldCos I can't leave things well aloneUnderstand I'm accident proneMe, I get freeEvery night the moon is mineBut when the morning comesDon't say you love meDon't say you need meI really don't think that's fairBoy I'm not so dumbBut when you leave meI'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing, I was thereI dreamt about another girl in bed with youYou just laughed and smiledDenied the proofWe're fine till I think of the problemI wish it made senseLike a joke that no one getsIt's a life without regretI want to feel that way, forever and everI know, I get cold'cause I can't leave things well aloneUnderstand I'm accident proneMe, I get freeEvery night the moon is mineBut when the morning comesDon't say you love meDon't say you need meI really don't think that's fairBoy I'm not so dumbBut when you leave meI'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing I was thereI'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing I was there with youI'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing I was thereI'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing I was there with youDon't say you love meDon't say you need meI really don't think that's fairBoy I'm not so dumbBut when you leave meI'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing, I was there with youI'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing, I was thereI'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing, I was there with youI'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing, I was thereI'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing, I was there with youI'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing, I was thereI'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing, I was there with you
