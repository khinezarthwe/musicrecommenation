Neptune is my king again His song in the sea... You're not gonna loosen me are you? You tied me to your love again As long as there's heaven I will rescue I need to bring you back again You say you are willing sometimes Now I feel more alive You cannot be loosenin' me, baby I only wanted this much Take this hand only once And I will try to be as pure as you And make this stand only for one Yeah, I will try to be As pure as you I tasted the salt on you Now I have a tongue tattoo I think of wings around me Imagine them, anyhow Oh please don't be loosenin' me, baby You tie me to your love again And now I feel overblown I need your fix in bed Take this hand only once And I will try to be as pure as you And make this stand only for one Oh, I will try to be As pure as you Neptune is my king again His song in the sea Standing in the room so elegant You tied me to your love
