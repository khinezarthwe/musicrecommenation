Neptune is my king againHis song in the sea...You're not gonna loosen me are you?You tied me to your love againAs long as there's heaven I will rescueI need to bring you back againYou say you are willing sometimesNow I feel more aliveYou cannot be loosenin' me, babyI only wanted this muchTake this hand only onceAnd I will try to be as pure as youAnd make this stand only for oneYeah, I will try to beAs pure as youI tasted the salt on youNow I have a tongue tattooI think of wings around meImagine them, anyhowOh please don't be loosenin' me, babyYou tie me to your love againAnd now I feel overblownI need your fix in bedTake this hand only onceAnd I will try to be as pure as youAnd make this stand only for oneOh, I will try to beAs pure as youNeptune is my king againHis song in the seaStanding in the room so elegantYou tied me to your love
