It's 8'o clock and I'm feeling fineI'm out on a date tonight in a candle light restaurant down by the riversideEverything's going all right, I guessShe took down my number and home addressEverything was going perfectly until...It backfired at the disco, she slapped me at the discoI did something I'll never forgetIt was a chat-up line built not to impressMore a sleazy remark on her whorish dressMy wires crossed like they've never done beforeWell it's 3 o' clock and I'm feeling shiteI'm going home alone tonightEverything was going perfectly until...It backfired at the disco, she slapped me at the discoI did something I'll never forgetIt backfired at the disco, we were dancing at the discoI made a move when it was well out of contextIt backfired at the disco, we were dancing at the discoIt backfired at the disco, we were dancing at the discoYeah, it backfired at the disco, when she slapped me at the discoIt backfired at the disco, we were dancing at the disco
