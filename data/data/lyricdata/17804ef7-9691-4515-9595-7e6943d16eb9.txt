In the heat of the violenceThe night's exploding everywhereWhen hate pulls the triggerThe devil comes to take his shareIn the garden of EdenThe time is running out so fastInto heart of the demonWith no escape our die is castIn the city of angelsDeath is just a moment awayIn the city of angelsYour future won't see the light of the dayBeware of the alien nationBeware of the truth that they seekThey pray for eternal salvationThey pray for your soul to keepOn the eve of destructionA reign of terror rules the streetWhen the heads start rollingThe devil comes to let it bleedIn the city of angelsDeath is just a moment awayIn the city of angelsYour future won't see the light of the dayWalk on past the alien nationWalk on to the end of your reachNo fear of the alien nationNo fear of the hatred they preachDon't run, there's no place to hideToday or tomorrow it will get youDon't move, the knife is right at your throatAnd whatever you do, there's no way outWhen the shroud comes down on this placeTo bury us all aliveWe'll know the time has come, to face the heatBeware of the alien nationBeware of the truth that they seekThey pray for eternal salvationThey pray for your soul to keepWalk on past the alien nationWalk on to the end of your reachThey pray for eternal damnationThey pray for your soul to keep
