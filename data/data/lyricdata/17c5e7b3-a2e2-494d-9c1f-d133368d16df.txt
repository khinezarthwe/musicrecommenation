I can't sleep tonightEverybody's saying everything is alrightStill I can't close my eyesI'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lightsSunny days, where have you gone?I get the strangest feeling you belongWhy does it always rain on me?Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?Why does it always rain on me?Even when the sun is shiningI can't avoid the lightningI can't stand myselfI'm being held up by invisible menStill life on a shelf whenI got my mind on something elseSunny days, oh, where have you gone?I get the strangest feeling you belongWhy does it always rain on me?Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?Why does it always rain on me?Even when the sun is shiningI can't avoid the lightningOh, where did the blue sky go?Why is it raining so? It's so coldI can't sleep tonightEverybody saying everything is alrightStill I can't close my eyesI'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lightsSunny days, oh, where have you gone?I get the strangest feeling you belongWhy does it always rain on me?Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?Why does it always rain on me?Even when the sun is shiningI can't avoid the lightningOh, where did the blue sky go?And why is it raining so? It's so coldWhy does it always rain on me?Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?Why does it always rain on me?Even when the sun is shiningI can't avoid the lightningWhy does it always rain on me?Why does it always rain on
