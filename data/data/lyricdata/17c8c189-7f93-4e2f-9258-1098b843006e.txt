Bluegirls come in every sizesome are wise and some otherwiseThey've got pretty blue eyesFor an hour a man may changeFor an hour her face looks strangeLooks strange, looks strangeMarching to the promised landWhere the honey flows and takes you by the handPulls you down on your kneesWhile you're down a pool appearsThe face in the water looks upAnd she shakes her head as if to sayThat it's the last time you'll look like todaySail away, awayRipples never come backGone to the other sideSail away, awayThe face that launched a thousand shipsIs sinking fast, that happens you knowThe water gets belowSeems not very long agoLovelier she was than any that I knowAngels never know it's timeTo close the book and gracefully declineThe song has found a taleMy, what a jealous pool is sheThe face in the water looks upAnd she shakes her head as if to sayThat the bluegirls have all gone awaySail away, awayRipples never come backGone to the other sideLook into the poolRipples never come backDive to the bottom and go to the top to see where they have goneOh, they've gone to the other side
