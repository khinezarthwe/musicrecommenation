I've made up my mind, don't need to think it overIf I'm wrong I am right, don't need to look no furtherThis ain't lust, I know this is loveBut if I tell the world, I'll never say enough'Cause it was not said to youAnd that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with youShould I give up or should I just keep chasing pavementsEven if it leads nowhere?Or would it be a waste even if I knew my placeShould I leave it there?Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavementsEven if it leads nowhere?I build myself up and fly around in circlesWaiting as my heart drops and my back begins to tingleFinally could this be it?Or should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavementsEven if it leads nowhere?Or would it be a waste even if I knew my placeShould I leave it there?Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavementsEven if it leads nowhere?Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavementsEven if it leads nowhere?Or would it be a waste even if I knew my placeShould I leave it there?Should I give up or should I just keep on chasing pavementsShould I just keep on chasing pavements?Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavementsEven if it leads nowhere?Or would it be a waste even if I knew my placeShould I leave it there?Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavementsEven if it leads nowhere?
