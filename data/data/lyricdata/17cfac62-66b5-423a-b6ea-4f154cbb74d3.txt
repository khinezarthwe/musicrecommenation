Ion square, perspex swingsI breathe out, you breathe inPermanent midnightOur love, our loveHow we've come to dependOn each other to the endThe space between us has disappearedYou finish my, you finish my words for meI remember how it beganSo many great days in a rowBarefoot on BishopsgateTrying to find Blake's graveIf we could stay like this in a silver foilTrapped in amber for a lifePermanent midnightOur love, our loveI carry your heart here with meI carry it in my heartI carry your heart with meI carry it in my heartWho said unbroken happinessIs a bore, is a bore?Who said it, my love? I don't mind itAnymore, anymoreAnd I reach out a hand over your side of the bedPull that blanket over your shoulders exposed to the nightAnd the hunger of those early years will never returnBut I don't mind, I don't mind'Cause I love my mind when I'm fucking youSlowed down to a crawlYears of crime and the bread lineHave not at all dimmed your shineSo let's stay in, let the sofa be our carLet's stay in, let the TV be our starsI found my dancing shoes, but they don't fitAll the bright lights do is bore meThey bore me, they bore meI carry your heart here with meI carry it in my heartI carry your heart with meI carry it in my heart
