To the centre of the city where all roads meet, waiting for youTo the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank, searching for youI was moving through the silence without motion, waiting for youIn a room with a window in the corner, I found truthIn the shadowplay, acting out your own death, knowing no moreAs the assassins all grouped in four lines, dancing on the floorAnd with cold steel, odour on their bodies, made a move to connectI could only stare in disbelief as the crowds all leftI did everything, everything I wanted toI let them use you for their own endsTo the centre of the city in the night, waiting for youTo the centre of the city in the night, waiting for you
