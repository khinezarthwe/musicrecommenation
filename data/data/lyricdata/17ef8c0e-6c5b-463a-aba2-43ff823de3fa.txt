I believe there's someone takin' care of me tonight As I walk into Dorian's, can you see it in my eyes? My boots are on the mend, and they ain't walking home Street tar in summer, do a job on your soul Street tar in summer, do a job on your soul ( Ooo) Jenny's watching cover shy, my head's feeling light I believe there's someone to takin' care of me tonight Anyhow, anyway, so I split Just getting out of love's gonna get me out of this? I spent the night in the map room I humanized the vacuum I believe there's someone takin' care of me tonight As I'm lookin' out at you, can you see that in... In my eyes, on the mend, nothing could lead me home Street tar in summer will play a trick on your soul Junie's gone day and night It made me feel so light Just soft-lit candlelight Junie's watching daylight All there is to feel a light Someone to take care of the light All the weird kids up front, tell me what you know you want Someone to take care tonight
