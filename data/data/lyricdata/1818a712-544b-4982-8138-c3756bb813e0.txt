So lonely was the ballad Harmonica man Sam was so knackered After jives of love He puts on the gloves then puts on his hat Then it's home to the missus who sits on his tongue Selfish sons with their packs of cigarerres Forking out two take your girl with the ticket Some times same other times not with it Standing at the picket man your hands they're freezing Girls with their pearls on the flex of Monroe's Half gee blow Marilyn's gone loco Navahoo High ho silver hey ho let's go dancing with the average Joe's Who talk with their fists and argue with their friends Always take the piss but they're loyal in the end Watch out 'cause they'll steal your girlfriend Take her round the back and she'll come back limping Girls singing on the bus fellas kicking up a fuss Crying out sighs but they're still looking dangerous Oh, this is definitely all for you Living life in the fast lane Give it up when you got no game Oh, this is definitely all for you So remember when you choke there is a reason being We leaving the town haven't been believing Blowing up smoke from the lung to the ceiling Making sure nightmares turn up in your dreaming We're all good as we bounce this way On the mic everyday hitting up the country, oh Good times in the old city Who listening and who wants war Girls singing on the bus fellas kicking up a fuss Crying out sighs but they're still looking dangerous Oh, this is definitely all for you Living life in the fast lane Give it up when you got no game Oh, this is definitely all for you Some of them said you never made the cut Young son breakaway want to be older Sober as a judge as the door slams shut Three bags full and a yes for the no sir Say as you leaving get up to go go Say hello sha woddy woddy wa wo wo There's never been a better way of getting right out of this town on Monday I still wear up my old tap shoes they fit You and me look twelve years old back when I was ten Whilst boozy Suzi got woozy with a who's he advantage taking If I ever see again that chaperone get kicked in the teeth High street down town well the dress is ripped and her shoes are soaking One step three back drinking potion Girls singing on the bus fellas kicking up a fuss Crying out sighs but they're still looking dangerous Oh, this is definitely all for you Living life in the fast lane Give it up when you got no game Oh, this is definitely all for you
