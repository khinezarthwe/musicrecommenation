So lonely was the balladHarmonica man Sam was so knackeredAfter jives of loveHe puts on the gloves then puts on his hatThen it's home to the missus who sits on his tongueSelfish sons with their packs of cigarerresForking out two take your girl with the ticketSome times same other times not with itStanding at the picket man your hands they're freezingGirls with their pearls on the flex of Monroe'sHalf gee blow Marilyn's gone loco NavahooHigh ho silver hey ho let's go dancing with the average Joe'sWho talk with their fists and argue with their friendsAlways take the piss but they're loyal in the endWatch out 'cause they'll steal your girlfriendTake her round the back and she'll come back limpingGirls singing on the bus fellas kicking up a fussCrying out sighs but they're still looking dangerousOh, this is definitely all for youLiving life in the fast laneGive it up when you got no gameOh, this is definitely all for youSo remember when you choke there is a reason beingWe leaving the town haven't been believingBlowing up smoke from the lung to the ceilingMaking sure nightmares turn up in your dreamingWe're all good as we bounce this wayOn the mic everyday hitting up the country, ohGood times in the old cityWho listening and who wants warGirls singing on the bus fellas kicking up a fussCrying out sighs but they're still looking dangerousOh, this is definitely all for youLiving life in the fast laneGive it up when you got no gameOh, this is definitely all for youSome of them said you never made the cutYoung son breakaway want to be olderSober as a judge as the door slams shutThree bags full and a yes for the no sirSay as you leaving get up to go goSay hello sha woddy woddy wa wo woThere's never been a better way of getting right out of this town on MondayI still wear up my old tap shoes they fitYou and me look twelve years old back when I was tenWhilst boozy Suzi got woozy with a who's he advantage takingIf I ever see again that chaperone get kicked in the teethHigh street down town well the dress is ripped and her shoes are soakingOne step three back drinking potionGirls singing on the bus fellas kicking up a fussCrying out sighs but they're still looking dangerousOh, this is definitely all for youLiving life in the fast laneGive it up when you got no gameOh, this is definitely all for you
