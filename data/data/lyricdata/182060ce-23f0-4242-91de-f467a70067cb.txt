If you take a life, do you know what you'll give?Odds are you won't like what it isWhen the storm arrives, would you be seen with meBy the merciless eyes of deceit?I've seen angels fall from blinding heightsBut you yourself are nothing so divineJust next in lineArm yourself, because no-one else here will save youThe odds will betray youAnd I will replace youYou can't deny the prize, it may never fulfill youIt longs to kill youAre you willing to die?The coldest blood runs through my veinsYou know my nameIf you come inside, things will not be the sameWhen you return to the nightAnd if you think you've won, you never saw me changeThe game that we have been playingI've seen diamonds cut through harder menThan you yourselfBut if you must pretendYou may meet your endArm yourself, because no-one else here will save youThe odds will betray youAnd I will replace youYou can't deny the prize, it may never fulfill youIt longs to kill youAre you willing to die?The coldest blood runs through my veinsTry to hide your hand, forget how to feel(Forget how to feel)Life is gone with just a spin of the wheel(Spin of the wheel)Arm yourself, because no-one else here will save youThe odds will betray youAnd I will replace youYou can't deny the prize, it may never fulfill youIt longs to kill youAre you willing to die?The coldest blood runs through my veinsYou know my name(You know my name)You know my name(You know my name)You know my nameYou know my nameYou know my name!
