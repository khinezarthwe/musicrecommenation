When I feel like you get too close I put you right downI never really leave I just slip awayAnd it's not my purpose to break your spiritI'm not really interested in what's in your heartI don't want you to fall in love now so please don't startI only want youI only want youI only want youI only want youI know that it's terribly cruel but then I like itBecause you tried to love me I just can't stayAnd I'm not gonna lie just to spare you feelings'Cause watching you suffer feels much better to meI'm about to lay destruction on youI'm not the lover man that you want me to beI said well...I only want youI only want youI only want youI only want youNow you see once you get too close I put you right downI never really leave I just slip awayBut it's not my purpose to break your spiritI'm not really interested in what's in your heartBut now I have to lay destruction on youI'm not the lover man that you want me to beI said well...I only want youI only want youI only want youI only want you
