I'm in love with the world through the eyes of a girl who's still around the morning afterWe broke up a month ago and I grew up; I didn't know I'd be around the morning afterIt's always been "Wait and see"; a happy day, and then you pay, and feel like shit the morning afterBut now I feel changed around, and instead of falling down I'm standing up the morning afterSituations get fucked up and turned around sooner or laterI could be another fool or an exception to the rule. You tell me the morning afterCrooked spin can't come to rest. I'm damaged bad at best. She'll decide what she wantsI'll probably be the last to know; no one says until it shows. See how it isThey want you or they don't say yesI'm in love with the world through the eyes of a girl who's still around the morning after
