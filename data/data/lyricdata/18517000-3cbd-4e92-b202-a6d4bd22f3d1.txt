Black night is not rightI don't feel so brightI don't care to sit tightMaybe I'll find on the way down the lineThat I'm free, free to be meBlack night is a long way from homeI don't need a dark treeI don't want a rough seaI can't feel, I can't seeMaybe I'll find on the way down the lineThat I'm free, free to be meBlack night is a long way from homeBlack night, black nightI don't need black nightI can't see dark nightMaybe I'll find on the way down the lineThat I'm free, free to be meBlack night is a long way from home
