Six foot six he stood on the ground,He weighed 235 poundsBut I saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by loveHe was the kind of man that would gamble on luckLook you in the eye and never back upBut I saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of loveYou can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your handsBut like the wind that covers our landStrong enough to rule the heart of every man, this thing called loveIt can lift you up, never let you downTake your world and turn it all aroundEver since time nothing's ever been found stronger than loveMost men are like me, they worry and doubtThey trouble their minds day in and day outToo busy with livin' to worry about a little word like loveBut when I see a mother's tendernessAs she holds her young close to her breastThen I thank God that the world's been blessed with the thing called loveYou can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your handsBut like the wind that covers our landStrong enough to rule the heart of every man, this thing called loveIt can lift you up, never let you downTake your world and turn it all aroundEver since time nothing's ever been found stronger than love
