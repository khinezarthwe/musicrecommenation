There's a war inside of meDo I cause new heartbreak to write a new broken songDo I push it down or let it run me right in to the groundI, I feel like, I wouldn't like me, if I met meWell I can't stop talking for fear of listening to unwelcome soundAnd you haven't called me in weeksAnd honestly it's bringing me downOhh I,I feel like, I wouldn't like me, if I met meI feel like, you wouldn't like me, if you met meAnd don't you worry there's still timeDon't you worry there's still timeThere's nothing to live for when I'm sleeping aloneAnd I wash the windows outside in hopes that the glare will, bring you aroundI, I feel like, I wouldn't like me, if I met meI, I feel like, you wouldn't like me, if you met meSo don't you worry there's still timeDon't you worry there's still timeDon't you worry there's still timeDon't you worry there's still timeSunshine is days away, I won't be savedI know all the wordsI can't say that I'll love you foreverSunshine is days away, I won't be savedI know all the wordsI can't say that I'll love you forever
