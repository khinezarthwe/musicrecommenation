I never thought I'd miss youHalf as much as I doAnd I never thought I'd feel this wayThe way I feel about youAs soon as I wake up every night every dayI know that it's you I needTo take the blues awayIt must be love, love, loveIt must be love, love, loveNothing more, nothing lessLove is the bestHow can it be that we canSay so much without wordsBless you and bless meBless the bees and the birdsI've got to be near you every night, every dayI couldn't be happy any other wayIt must be love, love, loveIt must be love, love, loveNothing more, nothing lessLove is the bestAs soon as I wake up every night every dayI know that it's you I needTo take the blues awayIt must be love, love, loveIt must be love, love, love(repeat to fade)
