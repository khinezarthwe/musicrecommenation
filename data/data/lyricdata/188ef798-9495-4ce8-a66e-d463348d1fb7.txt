How can I ever forget youYou don't know just what I've been throughThe holiday we spent togetherLives with me now and foreverI tried but I can't find youTell me now, what do I do?I tried but I can't find youTell me now, what do I do?I can't find my peace of mindBecause I need you with me all of the timeI used to think about you night and dayI used to feel what language cannot sayOh I can't find youNo I can't find my peace of mind without you.Maybe you'd write me a letterAnd tell me why I never met youOur rendezvous just ended in sorrowWithout you there's no tomorrow.I tried but I can't find youTell me now, what do I do?I tried but I can't find youTell me now, what do I do?I can't find my peace of mindBecause I need you with me all of the timeI used to think about you night and dayI didn't care what other people would sayOh I can't find youNo I can't find my peace of mind without you.I can't find my peace of mindBecause I need you with me all of the timeI used to think about you night and dayI used to feel what language cannot sayOh I can't find youNo I can't find my peace of mind without you.Ibiza, Majorca, and Benidorm tooI searched all these places but never found you
