He could have tuned in, tuned in, but he tuned outA bad time, nothing could save himAlone in a corridor waiting locked outHe got up out of there, ran for hundreds of milesHe made it to the ocean, had a smoke in a treeThe wind rose up, set him down on his kneeWave came crashing like a fist to the jaw,Delivered him wings, "Hey, look at me now..."Arms wide open with the sea as his floorOh â€“ ah, ohhh...He's - flying! HomeHigh! Wide! Home...He floated back down 'cause he wanted to shareHis key to the locks on the chains, he saw everywhereBut first he was stripped, then he was stabbedBy faceless men, well...fuckers, he still stands.And he still gives his love, he just gives it awayThe love he receives is the love that is savedAnd sometimes is seen a strange spot in the skyA human being that was given to flyFlying! Home...High! Flying! Home...He's Flying! Home...Ohh, oahh...Home...
