Honey, lovin' you is the greatest thingI get to be myself and I get to singI get to play at being irresponsibleI come home late and I love your soulI never forget you in my prayersI never have a bad thing to reportYou're my picture on the wallYou're my vision in the hallYou're the one I'm talking toWhen I get in from my workYou are my girl and you don't even know itI am livin' out the life of a poetI am the jester in the ancient courtAnd you're the funny little frog in my throatMy eyesight's fading, my hearing's dimI can't get insured for the state I'm inI'm a danger to myself, I've been starting fightsAt the party at the club on a Saturday nightBut I don't get disapproving from my girlShe gets all the highlights wrapped in pearlsYou're my picture on the wallYou're my vision in the hallYou're the one I'm talking toWhen I get in from my workYou are my girl and you don't even know itI am livin' out the life of a poetI am the jester in the ancient courtAnd you're the funny little frog in my throatHad a conversation with you at nightIt's a little one-sided but that's all rightI tell you in the kitchen about my dayYou sit on the bed in the dark changing placesWith the ghost that was there before you cameYou've come to save my life againI don't dare to touch your handI don't dare to think of youIn a physical wayAnd I don't know how you smellYou are the cover of my magazineYou're my fashion tip, a living museumI'd pay to visit you on rainy SundaysI'll maybe tell you all about it someday
