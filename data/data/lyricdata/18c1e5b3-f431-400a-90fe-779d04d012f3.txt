Up rolls the riot vanAnd sparks excitement in the boysBut the policemen look annoyedPerhaps these are ones they should avoidThey got a chase last nightFrom men with truncheons, dressed in hatsThey didn't do that much wrongStill ran away though for the laugh, just for the laughAnd, please, just stop talking'Cause they won't find us if you doOh, those silly boys in blueWell, they won't catch me and you"Have you been drinking son?You don't look old enough to me""I'm sorry, officer, is there a certain age you're supposed to be?'Cause nobody told me"And up rolls the riot vanAnd these lads just wind the coppers upThey ask why they don't catch proper crooksThey get their address and their names tookBut they couldn't care lessThrown in the riot vanAnd all the coppers kicked him inAnd there was no way he could winJust had to take it on the chin
