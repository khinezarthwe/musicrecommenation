Amplified the hidden dangers The oracle and then he calls me The invention in which he created is now for real How could you expect nothing else? Selfish enjoyment on the shelf Call out the witchdoctor, I think he's going insane It started with years full of drugs Self graced in his own harm in his hood The glorified collector, infectious with law and order And you're a parody of yourself Story filled with plenty of fuel It can go on and on and on I don't understand why someone can't be seeing this Are we all going in the same direction?
