Amplified the hidden dangersThe oracle and then he calls meThe invention in which he created is now for realHow could you expect nothing else?Selfish enjoyment on the shelfCall out the witchdoctor, I think he's going insaneIt started with years full of drugsSelf graced in his own harm in his hoodThe glorified collector, infectious with law and orderAnd you're a parody of yourselfStory filled with plenty of fuelIt can go on and on and onI don't understand why someone can't be seeing thisAre we all going in the same direction?
