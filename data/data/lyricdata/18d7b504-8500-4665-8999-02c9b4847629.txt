So you think you're a Romeo Playing a part in a picture show Take the long way home Take the long way home' Cause you're the joke of the neighbourhood Why should you care if you're feeling good? Take the long way home Take the long way home But there are times that you feel you're part of the scenery All the greenery is comin' down, boy And then your wife seems to think you're part of the furniture Oh, it's peculiar, she used to be so nice When lonely days turn to lonely nights You take a trip to the city lights And take the long way home Take the long way home You never see what you want to see Forever playing to the gallery You take the long way home Take the long way home And when you're up on the stage, it's so unbelievable Oh, unforgettable, how they adore you But then your wife seems to think you're losing your sanity Oh, calamity, is there no way out? Oh, yeah Ooh Ooh, yeah Does it feel that your life's become a catastrophe? Oh, it has to be for you to grow, boy When you look through the years and see what you could have been Oh, what you might have been if you'd have had more time So when the day comes to settle down Who's to blame if you're not around? You took the long way home You took the long way home You took the long way home ( Ooh, yeah, yeah) You took the long way home You took the long way home ( Oh, yeah) You took the long way home You took the long way home ( Ooh, yeah) You took the long way home Ah ah ah ah Ooh ooh ooh ooh Ah ah ah ah Long way home Long way home Long way home Long way home Long way home Long way home Long way home
