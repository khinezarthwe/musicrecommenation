Now get up and give in, I'll crack your knuckles againSupplicate and survive this transubstantiationAnd get so meanI want to know what it meansDid you laugh? You know I didDid you cry? Couldn't get it rightDid you live? Always on the edgeDid you lie? Causing such a frightDid you love? Oh, to be forgivenDid you try? But it wouldn't be rightGod, it feels like an honest goodbyeThat sick brass boy daydreaming, cry baby, convict, demonHands so clean, a sympathetic cold-blooded killing machineHow did you get so mean?I want to know what it meansDid you laugh? You know I didDid you cry? Couldn't get it rightDid you live? Always on the edgeDid you lie? Causing such a frightDid you love? Oh, to be forgivenDid you try? But it wouldn't be rightGod, it feels like an honest goodbye
