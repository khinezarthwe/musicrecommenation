I got a chain on my skinny wrist Got a chain on my wrist I'm tied down to an evil heart Tied down, evil heart A bitter pill but I crush it, yeah Bitter pill, crush it, yeah I snort it all and I feel ok Snort it all, feel ok I wonder how long will this wear on How long will this wear on I'd rather die than miss my fun I'd rather die than miss my fun The beauty of our love is dead Beauty of love is dead The lusty ones won't be tied down The lusty ones, don't tie them down Our love is being blitzed Our love is being blitzed Our love is being blitzed Our love is being blitzed Our love is being blitzed Our love is being blitzed Our love is being blitzed Our love is being blitzed
