There's a smell here that stands my hairs on endDog hair in the heater,Gas pumps and cedarAnd jack knives on the 9And sea birds choked in fishing lineThe clouds say hush but the chainsaws mush onThrough Cluster and ColumbiaSalty tentacles shrink in the sun but the red tide is overThe mollusks they have wonThere's a smell here of gravel and cigarettes litWhen the match made them sweetWhen the engine turned over and beat up our streetOh, that was a day to rememberI remember because of the fires that leftFrom the caves of the things that have not happened yetWhen I think of them now they smell to me quite sinisterI want to go back and die at the drive-inDie before strangers can say"I hate the rain""I hate the rain."
