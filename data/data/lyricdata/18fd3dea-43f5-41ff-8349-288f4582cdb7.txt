My ears are ringingThere's a tingling in the back of my throatCan't stop all the pressure building up in my headIn the nightEverybody wants itEverybody needs itEverybody needs itWhat's hurting me when I breathe?Perhaps it's just mold on the ceiling?Everybody's coming down with the same thingEverybody's coming down with the same thingGermsThey'll get you when you're not carefulGermsThey'll get you when you're not carefulGermsThey'll get you when you're not carefulGermsThey'll get you when you're not carefulGermsThey'll get you when you're not carefulGermsThey'll get you when you're not carefulBetter get some medicineIf you know what's good for youSand in my throat, sand in my throatAnd I wanna turn the water on
