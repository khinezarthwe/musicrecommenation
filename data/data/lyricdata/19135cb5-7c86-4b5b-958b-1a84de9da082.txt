There's a place I must goThere's a place I must goIt's not a place I have seenBut I'll get there in a new dreamDown an ocean roadPast a sign that says "good love town"Into a darkness where the stars do drownWhere the starry me needs to be freeAnd when the battle was doneI was promised my sonBut with a thousand (k)nights goneTo any kingdom I runAnd when the battle was doneI was promised my sonBut with a thousand (k)nights goneTo any kingdom I runThere's a place I must goThere's a place I must goFor my heart is a childThat stumbles lonely for the arms of a brideHear the desert sighSing the city's lullabyThe giant iris of the wide blue skyShowing me the wayAnd when the battle was doneI was promised my sonBut with a thousand (k)nights goneTo any kingdom I runAnd when the battle was doneI was promised my sonBut with a thousand (k)nights goneTo any kingdom I runYou know that it's time to go up, up, up, up, upHad a big machine riding your shouldersYou know that it's time to go up, up, up, up, upHad a big machine riding your shouldersYou know that it's time to go up, up, up, up, upHad a big machine riding your shoulders
