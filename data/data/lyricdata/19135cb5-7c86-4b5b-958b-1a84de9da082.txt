There's a place I must go There's a place I must go It's not a place I have seen But I'll get there in a new dream Down an ocean road Past a sign that says "good love town" Into a darkness where the stars do drown Where the starry me needs to be free And when the battle was done I was promised my son But with a thousand (k)nights gone To any kingdom I run And when the battle was done I was promised my son But with a thousand (k)nights gone To any kingdom I run There's a place I must go There's a place I must go For my heart is a child That stumbles lonely for the arms of a bride Hear the desert sigh Sing the city's lullaby The giant iris of the wide blue sky Showing me the way And when the battle was done I was promised my son But with a thousand (k)nights gone To any kingdom I run And when the battle was done I was promised my son But with a thousand (k)nights gone To any kingdom I run You know that it's time to go up, up, up, up, up Had a big machine riding your shoulders You know that it's time to go up, up, up, up, up Had a big machine riding your shoulders You know that it's time to go up, up, up, up, up Had a big machine riding your shoulders
