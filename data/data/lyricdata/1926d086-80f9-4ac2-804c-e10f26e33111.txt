How can I turn awayBrother/Sister go dancingThrough my headHuman as to humanThe future is no placeTo place your better daysCry freedom cryFrom a crowd 10,000 wideHope laid upon hopeThat this crowd will not subsideLet this flag burn to dustAnd a new a fair design be raisedWhile we wait head in handsHands in prayerAnd fall into a dreamless sleep againAnd we wave our handsHands and feet are all alikeBut gold between divide usHands and feet are all alikeBut fear between divide usAll slip awayThere was a window and by it stoodA mirror in whichHe could see himselfHe thought of somethingSomething he had never had but hoped would come alongCry freedom, cryFrom deep insideWhere we are all confinedWhile we wave hands in fireWave our handsHands and feet are all alikeBut gold between divide usHands and feet are all alikeBut fear between divide us,Slip awayIn this room stood a little childAnd in this room this little childShe would remainUntil someone might decideTo dance this little childAcross this hallInto a cold, dark, spaceWhere she might never trace her way across this crooked mileAcross this crooked pageCry freedom, cryFrom deep inside whereWe are all confinedTill we wave our handsHow can I turn awayBrother/Sister go dancingThrough my headHuman as to humanThe future is no placeTo place your better daysHands and feet are all alikeBut gold between divide usHands and feet are all alikeBut fear between divide usHands and feet are all alikeHear what I sayHear what I sayOh, so be itHow can I turn awayBrother/Sister go dancingThrough my headHuman as to humanThe future is no placeTo place your better days
