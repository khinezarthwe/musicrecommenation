We've lived in barsAnd danced on the tablesHotels, trains and ships that sailWe swim with sharksAnd fly with aeroplanes in the airSend in the trumpetsThe marching wheelchairsOpen the blankets and give them some airSwords and arches, bones and cementThe light and the dark of the innocence of menWe know your house so very wellAnd we will wake you once we've walked up all your stairsThere's nothing like living in a bottleAnd nothing like ending it all for the worldWe're so glad you have come backEvery living lion will lay in your lapThe kid has a homecoming! The champion, the whores!Who's gonna play drums, guitar or organ with chorusAs far as we've walked from both of ends of the sandNever have we caught a glimpse of this manWe know your house so very wellAnd we will bust down your door if you're not thereWe've lived in barsAnd danced on tablesHotels, trains and ships that sailWe swim with sharksAnd fly with aeroplanes out of hereOut of hereOut of hereOut of hereOut of here
