There are those who think that lifeHas nothing left to chance,A host of holy horrorsTo direct our aimless danceA planet of playthingsWe dance on the stringsOf powers we cannot perceive"The stars aren't aligned -Or the gods are malign"Blame is better to give than receive.You can choose a ready guideIn some celestial voice.If you choose not to decideYou still have made a choiceYou can choose from phantom fearsAnd kindness that can kill;I will choose a path that's clear-I will choose free willThere are those who think thatThey've been dealt a losing hand,The cards were stacked against them-They weren't born in Lotus-LandAll pre-ordainedA prisoner in chainsA victim of venomous fateKicked in the faceYou can pray for a placeIn heaven's unearthly estateYou can choose a ready guideIn some celestial voice.If you choose not to decideYou still have made a choiceYou can choose from phantom fearsAnd kindness that can kill;I will choose a path that's clear-I will choose free willEach of usA cell of awarenessImperfect and incompleteGenetic blendsWith uncertain endsOn a fortune huntThat's far too fleet.You can choose a ready guideIn some celestial voice.If you choose not to decideYou still have made a choiceYou can choose from phantom fearsAnd kindness that can kill;I will choose a path that's clear-I will choose free will
