The traffic lights are even dimmer then my past Give me a sign, some kind of religion, Allah, Buddha I don't care, I don't dare to choose one sign, one heart one feeling one God C A U S E I T' S O N E B L O O D F L O A T I N G I N T H E S T R E A M I T' S O N E B L O O D F L O A T I N G I N T H E S T R E A M…… Every day that goes I need more and more people around me, People I can rely to Not those fucking sellouts I read about in the paperswho's only hope are equally dumb consumers I'm up on that stage, I'm up here, You're down there Does that make me more important? more intelligent?

No but they don't know me either- Well, they think they do!, T H E Y T H I N K T H E Y D O!!! So what do I need to get through the day?- O N E B L O O D!
