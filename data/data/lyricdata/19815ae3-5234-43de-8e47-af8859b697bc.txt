Sun so bright that I'm nearly blind Cool 'cause I'm wired and I'm out of my mind Warm as the dope running down my spine But I don't care 'bout you and I got nothing to do Free as the water and air that I breathe Even freer than D M T Feel the warmth of the sun in me But I don't care 'bout you and I got nothing to do Love in the middle of the afternoon Just me and my spike in my arm and my spoon Feel the warmth of the sun in the room But I don't care about you and I got nothing I think I'm in love, probably just hungry I think I'm your friend, probably just lonely I think you've got me in a spin now, probably just turning I think I'm a fool for you babe, probably just yearning I think I can rock and roll, probably just twisting I think I wanna tell the world, probably ain't listening, come on I think I can fly, probably just falling I think I'm the life and soul, probably just snorting I think I can hit the mark, probably just aiming I think my name is on your lips, probably complaining I think I have caught it bad, probably contagious I think that I'm a winner, baby, probably Las Vegas, come on I think I'm alive, probably just breathing I think you stole my heart now, baby, probably just thieving I think I'm on fire, probably just smoking I think that you're my dream girl, probably just dreaming I think I'm the best, babe, come on, probably like all the rest I think that I could be your man, oh, probably just thinking, come on I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love
