Watching time go and feeling belief growRise above the obstaclesPeople beseech me but they'll never teach meThings that I already knowI knowDreams that I have shattered may not have matteredTake another point of viewDoubts will arise though like chasing a rainbowI can tell a thing or two(That's true)You've got to believe in yourselfOr no one will believe in youImagination like a bird on the wingFlying, free for you to use, okay babyI can't believe they stop and stareAnd point their fingers doubting meTheir disbelief suppresses themBut they're not blindIt's just that they won't seeI'm a believer, I ain't no deceiverMountains move before my eyesDestiny planned out I don't need no handoutSpeculation of the wise
