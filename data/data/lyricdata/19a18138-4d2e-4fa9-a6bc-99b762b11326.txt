I'm timeless like a broken watch I make money like Fred Astaire I see that you've come to resist me, I'm a pitbull in time The pretense is not what restricts me, it's the circles inside The anatomy of kisses and a teacher who tries, who knows how we'll disappear? Would you like to be my missus and in future with child? You know we can't get back from here but we can get away Baby, don't you try to find me Baby, don't you try to fight Baby, don't you try to find me Baby, it will be alright Along the way, tears drown in the wake of delight There's nothing like this built today You'll never see a finer ship in your life We sail today, tears drown in the wake of delight There's nothing like this built today You'll never see a finer ship or receive a better tip in your life I am the scavenger between the sheets of union Lately I can't tell for sure whether machines turn anyone I am the scavenger between the sheets of union Lately I can't tell for sure whether machines turn anyone Lady, don't you try to find me Lady, there is no need to fight Lady, don't you try to find me Lady, it will be alright We sail today, tears will drown in your wake of delight There's nothing like this built today You'll never see a finer ship in your life Along the way, the seas will crowd us with lovers at night There's nothing like this built today You'll never see a finer ship or receive a better tip in your life I see that you've come to resist me, I'm a pitbull in time White goddess, red goddess Black temptress of the sea, you treat me right Black goddess, red goddess White temptress of the sea, you treat me right White goddess, red goddess ( Oh my love, we are sailing to Norway) Black temptress of the sea, you treat me right ( Oh my love, we are leaving tonight) Black goddess, red goddess ( Oh my love, we are sailing to Norway) White temptress of the sea, you treat me right ( Oh my love, we are leaving tonight)
