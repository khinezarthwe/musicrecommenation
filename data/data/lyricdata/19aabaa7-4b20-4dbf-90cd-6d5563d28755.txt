Well now, she don't need to see the sun ahead Don't need that help from God above If you're losing her, don't be sad Cause she will offer you heart attacks She's tired of problems that you caused her mind Tired of all those lies in your freak show Tired of being alone at night Being the lowest cat on earth So Gloria steps out from the prison Gloria's no longer the wasted disco girl You've been dreaming about Gloria alone now forever Gloria away in the air now Gloria she's no longer your slave It's time for you to see yourself All the misery you brought up Gloria's one day ahead Watching you from the heaven's gate She's tired of problems that you caused her mind Tired of all those lies in your freak show Tired of being alone at night Being the lowest cat on Earth So Gloria steps out of the prison Gloria's no longer the wasted disco girl You've been dreaming about Gloria alone now forever Gloria away in the air now Gloria she's no longer your slave Gloria alone now forever Gloria away in the air now Gloria she's no longer your slave No, not anymore Gloria steps out of the prison Gloria's no longer the wasted disco girl You've been dreaming about Gloria alone now forever Gloria away in the air now Gloria she's no longer your slave
