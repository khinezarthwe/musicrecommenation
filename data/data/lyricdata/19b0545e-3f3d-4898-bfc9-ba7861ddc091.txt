The boy with the thorn in his sideBehind the hatred there liesA murderous desire for loveHow can they look into my eyesAnd still they don't believe me?How can they hear me say those wordsAnd still they don't believe me?And if they don't believe me nowWill they ever believe me?And if they don't believe me nowWill they, will they ever believe me?The boy with the thorn in his sideBehind the hatred there liesA plundering desire for loveHow can they see the love in our eyesAnd still they don't believe us?And after all this timeThey don't want to believe usAnd if they don't believe us nowWill they ever believe us?And when you want to liveHow do you start?Where do you go?Who do you need to know?
