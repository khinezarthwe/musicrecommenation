I just shook the handshake, I just sealed the dealI'll try not to let them take everything they can stealPeople always told me don't forget your rootsI know I can feel them underneath my leather bootsYou toss all the mornings lost to the clouds and you watch it goYour fairweather friends on a parachute binge get lost when the wind blowsThe handshake's stuck on the tip of my tongueIt tastes like death but it looks like funI was a loner, I was just waiting by myselfWhen you, warped temptress, rose to bring me happiness and wealthBlack tears, black smile, black credit cards and shoesYou can call all the people you want but it's you who's being usedUnder your black eyes, honey, right beneath your noseA curse on all creation, every single thing you knowWhite smoke, white light, white marble on the floorIt would only take a few seconds of darkness to figure out what's in store, little girlYou convince yourself that you want it but you don't knowYou keep trying to wash the blood from your hands but it won't goWe're gonna keep you on the runWe got the handshake under our tongueWe got the handshake under our tongueWe got the handshake under our tongueWe got the handshake under our tongueWe got the handshakeWe got the handshakeWe got the handshakeWe got the handshakeWe got the handshakeWe got the handshakeWe got the handshakeWe got the handshakeWe got the handshakeWe got the handshakeWe got the handshakeWe got the handshakeWe got the handshakeWe got the handshakeWe got the handshakeWe got the handshake
