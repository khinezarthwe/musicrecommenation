Guilty as charged but damn it, it ain't rightThere's someone else controlling meDeath in the air, strapped in the electric chairThis can't be happening to meWho made you God to say"I'll take your life from you"?Flash before my eyesNow it's time to dieBurning in my brainI can feel the flameWait for the sign to flick the switch of deathIt's the beginning of the endSweat chilling cold as I watch death unfoldConsciousness my only friendMy fingers grip with fearWhat am I doing here?Flash before my eyesNow it's time to dieBurning in my brainI can feel the flameSomeone help me, oh please God help meThey're trying to take it all awayI don't want to dieSomeone help me, oh please God help meThey're trying to take it all awayI don't want to dieTime moving slow, the minutes seem like hoursThe final curtain all I seeHow true is this? Just get it over withIf this is true, just let it beWakened by horrid screamFreed from this frightening dreamFlash before my eyesNow it's time to dieBurning in my brainI can feel the flame
