I'm lying in my bed, the blanket is warmThis body will never be safe from harmStill feel your hair, black ribbons of coalTouch my skin to keep me wholeIf only you'd come back to meIf you laid at my sideWouldn't need no mojo pinTo keep me satisfiedDon't want to weep for youI don't want to knowI'm blind and torturedThe white horses flowThe memories fireThe rhythms fall slowBlack beauty, I love you soPrecious, precious silver and goldAnd pearls in oyster's fleshDrop down we two to serve and pray to loveBorn again from the rhythmScreaming down from heavenAgeless, ageless and I'm there in your armsDon't want to weep for youI don't want to knowI'm blind and torturedThe white horses flowThe memories fireThe rhythms fall slowBlack beauty, I love you soThe welts of your scorn, my love, give me moreSend whips of opinion down my back, give me moreWell it's you I've waited my life to seeIt's you I've searched so hard forDon't want to weep for youI don't want to knowI'm blind and torturedThe white horses flowThe memories fireThe rhythms fall slowBlack beauty, I love you so
