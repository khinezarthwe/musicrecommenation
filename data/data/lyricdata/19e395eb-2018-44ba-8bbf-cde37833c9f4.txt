Running off over next door's gardenBefore the hour is doneIt's more a question of feelingThan it is a question of funThe confidence is the balaclavaI'm sure you'll baffle 'em goodWill the ending reek of salty cheeksAnd runny makeup alone?Oh, will blood run down the faceOf a boy bewildered and scorned?Will you find yourself in a skirmish?Will you wish you'd never been born?You tie yourself to the tracksAnd there isn't no going backAnd it's wrong, wrong, wrongBut we'll do it anyway 'cause we love a bit troubleAre you pulling her from a burning buildingOr throwing her to the sharks?Can only hope that the endingIs as pleasurable as the startThe confidence is the balaclavaI'm sure you baffle 'em straightAnd it's wrong, wrong, wrongShe can hardly waitThat's rightHe won't let her out his sightNow the shaggers perform and the daggers are drawnWho's the crooks in this crime?That's rightHe won't let her out his sightNow the shaggers perform and the daggers are drawnWho's the crooks in this crime?That's rightHe won't let her out his sightThat's rightHe won't let her out his sightThat's rightHe won't let her out his sightYou'd be able to post any day of the mostFor the sights of all timeYou knew that it would be troubleRight before the very first kissQuiet and assumingBut you heard that they were the naughtiestShe pleaded with you to take it offBut you resisted and fought"I'm sorry, sweetheart, I'd much ratherKeep on the balaclava"
