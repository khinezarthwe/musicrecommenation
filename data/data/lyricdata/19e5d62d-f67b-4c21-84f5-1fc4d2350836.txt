Drink up, baby. Stay up all night with the things you could do, you won't but you mightThe potential you'll be that you'll never see. The promises you'll only makeDrink up with me now and forget all about the pressure of days, "do what I say"And I'll make you okay and drive them away, the images stuck in your headPeople you've been before that you don't want around anymoreThat push and shove and won't bend to your will. I'll keep them stillDrink up, baby, look at the stars. I'll kiss you again, between the barsWhere I'm seeing you there with your hands in the air, waiting to finally be caughtDrink up one more time and I'll make you mine. Keep you apart, deep in my heartSeparate from the rest, where I like you the best, and keep the things you forgotPeople you've been before that you don't want around anymoreThat push and shove and won't bend to your will. I'll keep them still
