I've watched your face for a long timeIt's always the sameI've studied the cracks and the wrinklesYou were always so vainNow you live your life like a shadowIn the pouring rainOh, it's called loveYes, it's called loveOh, it's called loveAnd it belongs to usOh, it dies so quicklyIt grows so slowlyBut when it dies, it dies for goodIt's called loveAnd it belongs to everyone but usI've lived my life in the valleysI've lived my life on the hillsI've lived my life on alcoholI've lived my life on pillsBut it's called loveAnd it belongs to usIt's called loveAnd it's the only thing that's worth living forIt's called loveAnd it belongs to usIt's called loveYes it's called loveOh, love is found in the east and the westBut when love is at home, it's the bestLove is the cure for every evilLove is the air that supports the eagleIt's called loveAnd it's so un-coolIt's called loveAnd somehow it's become unmentionableIt's called loveAnd it belongs to every one of usIt's called loveAnd it cuts your life like a broken knife
