Break me in, teach us to cheatAnd to lie and cover upWhat shouldn't be sharedAnd the truth unwindingScraping away at my mindPlease stop asking me to describeFor one momentI wish you'd hold your stageWith no feelings at allOpen mindedI'm sure I used to be so freeSelf expressed, exhausting for all to seeAnd to be what you wantAnd what you needAnd the truth's unwindingScraping away at my mindPlease stop asking me to describeFor one momentI wish you'd hold your stageWith no feelings at allOpen minded,I'm sure I used to be so freeFor one momentI wish you'd hold your stageWith no feelings at allOpen mindedI'm sure I used to be so freeWash me awayClean your body of meErase all the memoriesThey'll only bring us painAnd I've seen all I'll ever need
