I don't care to say what I failed to recognize Every single day from the poker to the prize Running out of Springfield I worked for the Capitol Air, in the bags Found a woman there who saidshe had a mind to makeme a messenger man If my father took his lifefor the national plan, I don't care I'm not about to stick my grave with anapron and a bucket of plans, never ever I can take the pillow casesoff the yellow pillows,make a property line from the bed In the living room, the living room,the morning papers made the mostout of nothing at all So we took the roomwith a view of the runaway I took off my clothes,and she took it for a holiday I was taken for all the thingsthat I never had before Running out of Springfieldshe left me with a note saying:" Bobby, don't look back." And if my wife took a bicycle ridewith a knife in her hand I saw it coming All the shad-flies run at oncewith a trumpet or a train,oh I'm running from it Wait a minute, wait a minute, Give a minute, lady I can explain the aftershave Wait a minute, wait a minute,give a minute Bobby got a shad flycaught in his hair
