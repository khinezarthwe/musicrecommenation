They stumbled into their livesIn a vague way became man and wifeOne got the other they deserved one anotherThey settled in a brand new townWith people from the same backgroundKept themselves busyLong hours left them dizzyNow when he's in, she's outAll you ever do is fade awayAll you ever do is fade awayThey are not making plansBecause now they understandAll you ever do is fade awayHe noticed he had visible linesShe worried about her behindTheir birth had been the death of themIt didn't really bother themNow when she's in, he's outAll you ever do is fade awayAll you ever do is fade awayShe's not making plansBecause now she understandAll you ever do is fade awayWhen he's in, she's outAll you ever do is fade awayAll you ever do is fade awayThey're not making plansBecause now they understandYou must learn to forgetCause this is all you haveAll you ever do is fade awayAll you ever do is fade awayAll you ever do is fade awayThey're not making plansBecause now they understandAll you ever do is fade awayAll you ever do is fade awayAll you ever do is fade away
