So you don't wanna hear about my good song? You don't wanna hear about how I am getting on With all the things that I can get done; The sun is in the sky, and I am by my lonesome... So you don't wanna hear about my good day? You have better things to do than to hear me say," God, it's been a lovely day, everything's been going my way; I took out the trash today, and I'm on fire..." So you don't wanna hear about my good friends; You don't have the guts to take the truth or consequence... Success is in the eye of the beholder, And it's looking even better over your cold shoulder... I'm not suggesting you get to line me up for questioning, But Jesus, think about the bridges you are burning, And I'm betting that even though you knew it from the start, You'd rather be a bitch than be an ordinary broken heart... So go ahead and talk about your bad day; I want all the details of the pain and misery That you are inflicting on the others; I consider them my sisters, and I want their numbers... God, it's been a lovely day, everything's been going my way; I took up croquet today, and I'm on fire... I picked up the pieces of my broken ego; I have finally made my peace as far as you and me go, But I'd love to have you up to see the place; I'd like to do more than survive, I'd like to rub it in your face! Ah! Hey, it's been a lovely day, everything's been going my way, I had so much fun today, and I'm on fire... God, it's been a lovely day! Everything's been going my way; Ever since you went away, hey, I'm on fire... I'm on fire... I'm on fire... I'm on... I'm on fire... I'm on fire... I'm on fire... I'm on... So you don't wanna hear about my good day?*** Now the war is over, Mussolini's dead; He wants to go to heaven with a crown upon his head... The Lord says no, he's got to stay below; All dressed up, and nowhere to go...
