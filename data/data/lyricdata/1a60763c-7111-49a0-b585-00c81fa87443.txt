I'm sorryTwo words I always thinkAfter you're goneWhen I realize I was acting all wrongSo selfishTwo words that could describeOh, actions of mineWhen patience is in short supplyWe don't need to say goodbyeWe don't need to fight and cryOh we, we could hold each other tightTonightWe're so helplessWe're slaves to our impulsesWe're afraid of our emotionsNo one, knows where the shore isWe're divided by the oceanAnd the only thing I know isThe answer it isn't for usNo the answer isn't for usI'm sorryTwo words I always thinkAfter you're goneWhen I realize I was acting all wrongWe don't need to say goodbyeWe don't need to fight and cryNo we, we could, we could hold each other tightTonight...Tonight...Tonight...Tonight...
