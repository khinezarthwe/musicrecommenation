I took the train back Back to where I came from I took it all alone, it's been so long, I know Imagine me there my heart asleep with no air Begging ocean please, help me drown these memories All I need to hear is that you're not mine, you're not mine I'm moving east then Somewhere far away from The sight of my hands The sight of me not moving You can't just hop a plane and come and visit me again I claim it's in my head and I regret offering All I need to hear is that you're not mine, you're not mine All I want to hear is that you're not mine, you're not mine You take a second, take a second Take a year, take a year You took me out and took me in And told me all of this and then You take a moment, you take a moment You take a year, you take a year You helped me out, I listened in You taught me all of this and then All I want to hear is that you're not mine, you're not mine All I want to hear is that you're not mine, you're not mine All I need to hear is that you're not mine, you're not mine All I want to hear is that you're not mine, you're not mine
