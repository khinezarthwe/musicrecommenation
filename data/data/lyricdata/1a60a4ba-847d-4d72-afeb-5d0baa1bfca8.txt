I took the train backBack to where I came fromI took it all alone, it's been so long, I knowImagine me there my heart asleep with no airBegging ocean please, help me drown these memoriesAll I need to hear is that you're not mine, you're not mineI'm moving east thenSomewhere far away fromThe sight of my handsThe sight of me not movingYou can't just hop a plane and come and visit me againI claim it's in my head and I regret offeringAll I need to hear is that you're not mine, you're not mineAll I want to hear is that you're not mine, you're not mineYou take a second, take a secondTake a year, take a yearYou took me out and took me inAnd told me all of this and thenYou take a moment, you take a momentYou take a year, you take a yearYou helped me out, I listened inYou taught me all of this and thenAll I want to hear is that you're not mine, you're not mineAll I want to hear is that you're not mine, you're not mineAll I need to hear is that you're not mine, you're not mineAll I want to hear is that you're not mine, you're not mine
