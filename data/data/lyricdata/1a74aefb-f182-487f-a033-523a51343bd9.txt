18 karat gold wouldn't fill the holeThe bleeding hole in her heartThat's made from circumstances at homeCus they kept pulling her hairSo they choked her wordsShe don't sleep at night, afraid to turn out the lightAnd she's homeI thought: 18 karat gold, would save a lonely soulBut she don't sleep at night, afraid to turn out the lightCause they kept pulling her hairWouldn't leave her aloneBut if only I could read her mindAnd release that stoneIn her heart where the sadness growsI'd operate with this knifeAnd cut a big fat giant holeTo fill with gold and lightBut there's an endless battle to be wonAnd me I ain't a man with an educated mindAnd soon, you won't have the strength to carry onSo you scream about it in the nightOhh in the night....In the night....Ohh in the night....My 18 karat gold, it fills a dirty holeA dirty bleeding hole in my heartYou people think it's made from circumstances at homeWell if someone ever should be pulling your hairThen I guess you should leave them aloneAnd now you want me to read your mindAnd release that stoneThat stone in your heart where the sadness growsYou know I, I'd operate with this knifeAnd cut a big fat giant hole to fill.Fill with gold and lightBut there's an endless battle to be wonMe I ain't a man with an educated mindAnd soon, you won't have the strength to carry onSo you scream about it in the nightNext endless battle to be wonI ain't a man with an educated mindAnd you won't have the strength to carry onSo you scream about it in the nightOhh in the night....Ohh in the night....In the night....
