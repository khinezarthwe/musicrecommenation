18 karat gold wouldn't fill the hole The bleeding hole in her heart That's made from circumstances at home Cus they kept pulling her hair So they choked her words She don't sleep at night, afraid to turn out the light And she's home I thought: 18 karat gold, would save a lonely soul But she don't sleep at night, afraid to turn out the light Cause they kept pulling her hair Wouldn't leave her alone But if only I could read her mind And release that stone In her heart where the sadness grows I'd operate with this knife And cut a big fat giant hole To fill with gold and light But there's an endless battle to be won And me I ain't a man with an educated mind And soon, you won't have the strength to carry on So you scream about it in the night Ohh in the night.... In the night.... Ohh in the night.... My 18 karat gold, it fills a dirty hole A dirty bleeding hole in my heart You people think it's made from circumstances at home Well if someone ever should be pulling your hair Then I guess you should leave them alone And now you want me to read your mind And release that stone That stone in your heart where the sadness grows You know I, I'd operate with this knife And cut a big fat giant hole to fill. Fill with gold and light But there's an endless battle to be won Me I ain't a man with an educated mind And soon, you won't have the strength to carry on So you scream about it in the night Next endless battle to be won I ain't a man with an educated mind And you won't have the strength to carry on So you scream about it in the night Ohh in the night.... Ohh in the night.... In the night....
