Just talked to this girl who used to live on my street After all these years you're here and you remember me She said her old boyfriend packed up and headed back east But she always knew someday he would go She just got a new job and she doubts it will last So let's take a drink and never think and here's to the past She said it's so funny how life burns out so fast It's just another wasted day A boring life in a boring town with the same old crowd And I used to say that I'd never stay, but I'm rotting here today With that same old crowd that's always been around And I always thought I'd be the first to go That same old crowd that drags me down Another day in a boring town That same old crowd that brings me down A boring life in a boring town Just talked to this girl who used to live on my street After all these years you're here and it's still just you and me Sometimes I can't believe after all these years I just think I'll never leave here She said it's so funny how life burns out so fast So let's take another drink and here's to the past That same old crowd that drags me down Another day in a boring town That same old crowd that brings me down A boring life in a boring town And remember when they'd look through you And they'd look past me? We were the ones they said would always leave So when you go, just think of me, think of me A boring life in a boring town with the same old crowd And I used to say that I'd never stay, but I'm rotting here today With that same old crowd that's always been around And I always thought that, and I always thought that And I always thought I'd be the first to go A boring life A boring town A boring life A boring town A boring life In a boring town
