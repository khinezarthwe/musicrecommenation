In my head a beating drumDeep down inside the day will comeWhen I can sing these words to youIt’s the least that I can doIn my school the freaky oneMy hands were sore, my fingers numbFrom making rhythms on my deskMy heart was banging in my chestSo it came to pass my beatsWere broken by the other kidsThey make stronger, make me deeper,So my path is getting steeperI love my syncopated cityThis is my fascinating rhythmI need my syncopated cityI love my mindless repetitionAt the table, fingers tappingWish that I could stop this happeningIn the morning, in the eveningWhile I’m working, while I’m sleepingIn the street with people watchingI can’t stop myself from jumpingIf I smile and look convincingMaybe they will think....I’m dancingI love my syncopated cityThis is my fascinating rhythmI need my syncopated cityI love my sense of dislocationI loveI loveI loveIf it wasn’t for music I would give it all awayI need the syncopationI need the modulationI need the real soul musicI need that unexpected twist and turn.
