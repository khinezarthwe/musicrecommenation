In my head a beating drum Deep down inside the day will come When I can sing these words to you It’s the least that I can do In my school the freaky one My hands were sore, my fingers numb From making rhythms on my desk My heart was banging in my chest So it came to pass my beats Were broken by the other kids They make stronger, make me deeper, So my path is getting steeper I love my syncopated city This is my fascinating rhythm I need my syncopated city I love my mindless repetition At the table, fingers tapping Wish that I could stop this happening In the morning, in the evening While I’m working, while I’m sleeping In the street with people watching I can’t stop myself from jumping If I smile and look convincing Maybe they will think.... I’m dancing I love my syncopated city This is my fascinating rhythm I need my syncopated city I love my sense of dislocation I love I love I love If it wasn’t for music I would give it all away I need the syncopation I need the modulation I need the real soul music I need that unexpected twist and turn.
