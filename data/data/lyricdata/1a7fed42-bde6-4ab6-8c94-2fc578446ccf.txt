Head down, keep your head downKeep your rent down over timeHold tight, to your red stripeWhy do we fight every time?I wish that you could see me in the dayI hope that you'll remember me that wayNightclub, Marlboro light stubStuck to my gum all the timeI treat youLike you're see-throughI don't mean toEvery timeI wish that you could see me in the dayI hope that you'll remember me that wayWhat did I ever give youWhen you wanted me toAll I gave you was painAnd a look of disdainWhat did I ever give youWhen you wanted me toAll I gave you was griefAre you sick to your teeth?DisgracedBack to my placeI'm a complete wasteOf your timeI'm asleepBefore the first sheepUntil the last bleepOf all timeI wish that you could see me in the dayI hope that you'll remember me that wayWhat did I ever give youWhen you wanted me toAll I gave you was painAnd a look of disdainWhat did I ever give youWhen you wanted me toAll I gave you was griefAre you sick to your teethWhat did I ever give you?
