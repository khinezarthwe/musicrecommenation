And in the dark it comes for meMalevolent and without thoughtUprooting trees, destroying carsCold and relentless, with arms outstretchedNo boat nor brickNor crucifix can hold it backI've been wickedI've been arrogantAnd when it comes it will feel like a kiss (Silent about it)And when it comes it will feel like a kissAnd I cannot say that I was not warned or was misledWhen it comes it will feel like a kissAwaken from dreams of drunken car crashesYou saddened my friends and claimed all my loversI tried to stay still, so it will not seeIts talons rake the side of my faceOh, when did you becomeSuch a slut?And when it comes it will feel like a kiss (Silent about it)And when it comes it will feel like a kissAnd I cannot say that I was not warned or was misledWhen it comes it will feel like a kissAnd I didn't think I'd catch fireWhen I held my hand to the flameAnd I didn't think it would catch upAs fast as I could have runFate came a-knockingWhen I was looking the other wayA new disease came in the postFor me todayAnd when it comes it will feel like a kissAnd when it comes it will feel like a kissAnd when it comes (And when it comes)And when it comes (And when it comes)And when it comesAnd when it comes it will feel like a kiss
