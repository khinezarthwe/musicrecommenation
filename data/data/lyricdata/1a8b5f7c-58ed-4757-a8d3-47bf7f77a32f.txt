She's got a smile that it seems to meReminds me of childhood memoriesWhere everything was as freshAs the bright blue skyNow and then when I see her faceShe takes me away to that special placeAnd if I stare too longI'd probably break down and cryWoah oh oh, sweet child o' mineWoah oh oh oh, sweet love of mineShe's got eyes of the bluest skiesAnd if they thought of rainI'd hate to look into those eyesAnd see an ounce of painHer hair reminds me of a warm, safe placeWhere as a child I'd hideAnd pray for the thunder and the rainTo quietly pass me byWoah oh oh, sweet child o' mineWoah oh oh oh, sweet love of mineOh oh yeahWoah oh oh oh, sweet child o' mineWoah oh oh oh, sweet love of mineWoah oh oh oh, sweet child o' mine, ooh yeahOoh, sweet love of mine(Where do we go?)(Where do we go now?)(Where do we go?)Mm, where do we go?
