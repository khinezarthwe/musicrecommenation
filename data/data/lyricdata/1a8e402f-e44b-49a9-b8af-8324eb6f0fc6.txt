You walked with meFootprints in the sandAnd helped me understandWhere I'm goingYou walked with meWhen I was all aloneWith so much unknownAlong the wayThen I heard you sayChorusI promise youI'm always thereWhen your heart is filled with sorrow and despairI'll carry youWhen you need a friendYou'll find my footprints in the sandI see my lifeFlash across the skySo many times have IBeen so afraidAnd just when II thought I'd lost my wayYou gave me strength to carry onThat's when I heard you sayChorusWhen I'm wearyI know you'll be thereAnd I can feel youWhen you sayChorus x 2
