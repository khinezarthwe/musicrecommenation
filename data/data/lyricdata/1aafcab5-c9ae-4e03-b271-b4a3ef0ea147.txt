Travelling through the timeMoving slowly in the sandKnowledge is the weaponAgainst the hunger in the landSolitude met herselfLessons from the primal stepMemories from an ending lifeLiars can't stop the tribesNomad, nomad, nomad, nomadBrother is the son of rapeThe blood that once unitesWanna choose the way they dieLook inside their mindsEchoes in the...Actual tribe no longer soundsThe ancient teachings failedMovement of my cultureMy beliefs have no more talesWho are you to criticizeTo judge and burn the tribesThe world will be extinctAnd your flesh will rot with mineNomad, nomad, nomad, nomad
