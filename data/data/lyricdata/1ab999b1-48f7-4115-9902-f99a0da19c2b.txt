I will not give in to fascist beliefs and I am not a foolI will not let pride in my core be rooted outI will stand firm on my beliefsLive life the master of my destiny, see no other way to liveI am not the weak willedNor am I a fool who can not seeI am not the weak willedI will not let pride destroy meWise men can see theDifference in compromiseAnd laying down ones beliefsThere shall be wisdom in my beliefsThey shall be rooted in strength not failureWith lies on your tongue seek to deceiveYou've fallen victim to the human conditionAnd it's lead to your defeatI am not the weak willedNor am I a fool who can not seeI am not the weak willedI will not let pride destroy meI will not let pride destroy me
