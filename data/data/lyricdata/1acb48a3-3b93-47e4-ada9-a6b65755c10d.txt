I'm sitting on a citadel Contemplating life Making a point to waste my time Im walking on clouds of white What if I fall What if I don't What if I never make it home What if I bleed What if I break And I find that I can't take The city below The citadel holding my own hand? And I'm breaking on the balcony Breaking window panes Im killing the pain of broken hearts I'm walking on clouds I'm walking on stars What if I fall What if I don't What if I never make it home What if I bleed What if I break And I find that I can't take The city below The citadel holding my own hand Holding on to something That's keeping me from jumping So afraid to go it alone And holding up this fortress With imaginary forces Longing for a life down below What if I fall? What if I don't? What if I never make it home? What if I bleed? What if I break? And I find that I can't take The city below The citadel holding my own hand? Yeah the city below The citadel holding my hand
