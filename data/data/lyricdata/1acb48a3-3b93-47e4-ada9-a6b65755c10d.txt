I'm sitting on a citadelContemplating lifeMaking a point to waste my timeIm walking on clouds of whiteWhat if I fallWhat if I don'tWhat if I never make it homeWhat if I bleedWhat if I breakAnd I find that I can't takeThe city belowThe citadel holding my own hand?And I'm breaking on the balconyBreaking window panesIm killing the pain of broken heartsI'm walking on cloudsI'm walking on starsWhat if I fallWhat if I don'tWhat if I never make it homeWhat if I bleedWhat if I breakAnd I find that I can't takeThe city belowThe citadel holding my own handHolding on to somethingThat's keeping me from jumpingSo afraid to go it aloneAnd holding up this fortressWith imaginary forcesLonging for a life down belowWhat if I fall?What if I don't?What if I never make it home?What if I bleed?What if I break?And I find that I can't takeThe city belowThe citadel holding my own hand?Yeah the city belowThe citadel holding my hand
