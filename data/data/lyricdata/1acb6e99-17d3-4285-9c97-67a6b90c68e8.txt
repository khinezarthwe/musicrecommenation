If you get tired of just hangin' around Pick up a guitar and spin a web of sound And then you could be strung out all day with your lovers and clowns Now I find myself hangin' around It's been a long war, we're I'm tired and dirty Still not dirty enough for you I've been thieving, I stole the light from the dawn And if you come round on this ledge, you wish you'd never been born Oh, tell me you can see me or can't you see through it all? I'm empty, lost, alone, won't you heed my call? It's been a long war, yes, we're tired and dirty Still not dirty enough for you, oh Oh, I'm so tired of hangin' around Oh, I'll pick up the guitar, spin a web of sound Spin, my love So tired of hangin' around Just hangin' around Just hangin' around
