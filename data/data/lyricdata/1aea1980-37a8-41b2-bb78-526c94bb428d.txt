Carry on my wayward sonThere'll be peace when you are doneLay your weary head to restDon't you cry no moreAhhOnce I rose above the noise and confusionJust to get a glimpse beyond this illusionI was soaring ever higherBut I flew too highThough my eyes could see, I still was a blind manThough my mind could think, I still was a mad manI hear the voices when I'm dreamingI can hear them sayCarry on, my wayward sonThere'll be peace when you are doneLay your weary head to restDon't you cry no moreMasquerading as a man with a reasonMy charade is the event of the seasonAnd if I claim to be a wise man, wellIt surely means that I don't knowOn a stormy sea of moving emotionTossed about, I'm like a ship on the oceanI set a course for winds of fortuneBut I hear the voices sayCarry on, my wayward sonThere'll be peace when you are doneLay your weary head to restDon't you cry no moreNo!Carry on, you will always rememberCarry on, none can equal the splendorNow your life's no longer emptySurely heaven waits for youCarry on, my wayward sonThere'll be peace when you are doneLay your weary head to restDon't you cry (Don't you cry no more)No more
