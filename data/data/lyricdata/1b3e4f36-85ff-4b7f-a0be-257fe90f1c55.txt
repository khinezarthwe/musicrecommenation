Well, I think it's really time again for a revolutionNot to destroy at all costs but have a look at what's thereCan you remember a time when water was still waterOr are you too young to even know what we won't give to our heirsInhale the bless of science through your lungs, skin and brain!I'll surely make our children feel a lot more sane!Revolution now!I was born when April guaranteed a sexual renaissanceAnd today we're all faced with death, rubbers, and AIDSIn '68 some people went out to fight for freedomThey would never ever have thought that their children wear tiesAnd if you come to San FranciscoYou're gonna meet some broken people thereRevolution now!
