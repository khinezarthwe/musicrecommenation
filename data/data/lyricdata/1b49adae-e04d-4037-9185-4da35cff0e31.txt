When I fell inside out of the snow and by your fireIn this time I've learnedChange your hate cause that's your slaveTurn your head from your evil waysYour church is red blood flows black from your heartWe build our temple one brick at a timeAnd the straw I steal to build your nestI've learnedChange your hate cause that's your slaveTurn your head from the evil waysYour church is red blood flows blackAnd when the bells ring they'll all come to seeWhen the bells ring out tonightFor my wounded heartYou can paint it over cause below I knowAnd when the bells ring they'll all come to seeThere's a fire in the fields a killer in the mirrorWhen the bells ring out tonightFor my change of heart
