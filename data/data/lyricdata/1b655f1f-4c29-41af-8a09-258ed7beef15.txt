Down in the old town, when my mind is wanderingRound empty hallways, when will I be one again?You're just making it harder for yourselfMaking it easy for everyone elseMaking it easy for meIn the old townYou'll never be in and you never get outYou learn from the familyYou'll never be in and you never get outTo run to the end of the earthUnder the archways, when my mind is wallowingDown to the country, where I will be well againYou're just making it harder for yourselfMaking it easy for everyone elseYou're making it easy for meIn the old townYou'll never be in and you never get outYou learn from the familyYou'll never be in and you never get outTo run to the end of the earth, to the end of the earthAnd run to the end of the earthBuild me a home undergroundFree from light and soundBuild me a home in the airI will run to the end, to the end, to the end of the earthAnd run to the end, to the end, to the end of the earthAnd run to the end of the earth
