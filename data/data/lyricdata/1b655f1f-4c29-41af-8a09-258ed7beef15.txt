Down in the old town, when my mind is wandering Round empty hallways, when will I be one again? You're just making it harder for yourself Making it easy for everyone else Making it easy for me In the old town You'll never be in and you never get out You learn from the family You'll never be in and you never get out To run to the end of the earth Under the archways, when my mind is wallowing Down to the country, where I will be well again You're just making it harder for yourself Making it easy for everyone else You're making it easy for me In the old town You'll never be in and you never get out You learn from the family You'll never be in and you never get out To run to the end of the earth, to the end of the earth And run to the end of the earth Build me a home underground Free from light and sound Build me a home in the air I will run to the end, to the end, to the end of the earth And run to the end, to the end, to the end of the earth And run to the end of the earth
