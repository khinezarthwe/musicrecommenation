Float down stream, rivers of dreamsFloat down stream, catch your wingsHeavens high, so you flyCatch your dreams in the skyBut the glaciers have frozen your feetI can't wait for eternityAnd so you watched me wash awayBut maybe we'll catch up somedayMaybe well catch up somedaySun sinks out of viewStars they shine changing hueBut bright lights have blinded your sightsThey cant adjust when day turns to nightAnd so you watched me wash awayBut maybe well catch up somedayThe castles we built were so tallThey only left us further to fallAnd still I see them far awayBut maybe we'll come back somedayMaybe we'll come back somedayFloat down stream, rivers of dreamsFloat down stream, catch your wingsThe castles we built were so tallThey only left us further to fallAnd still I see them far awayMaybe well come back somedayThe castles we built were so tallThey only left us further to fallAnd still I see them far awayAs I watch them wash awayWash away...Wash away...Wash away...Wash away...
