Float down stream, rivers of dreams Float down stream, catch your wings Heavens high, so you fly Catch your dreams in the sky But the glaciers have frozen your feet I can't wait for eternity And so you watched me wash away But maybe we'll catch up someday Maybe well catch up someday Sun sinks out of view Stars they shine changing hue But bright lights have blinded your sights They cant adjust when day turns to night And so you watched me wash away But maybe well catch up someday The castles we built were so tall They only left us further to fall And still I see them far away But maybe we'll come back someday Maybe we'll come back someday Float down stream, rivers of dreams Float down stream, catch your wings The castles we built were so tall They only left us further to fall And still I see them far away Maybe well come back someday The castles we built were so tall They only left us further to fall And still I see them far away As I watch them wash away Wash away... Wash away... Wash away... Wash away...
