I saw your face in the morning sunOh, I thought you were thereI heard your voice as the wind passed me bySilently, whispering my nameSo many things that I wanted to sayForever left untoldI still remember the tears that you shedOver someone elseOur love could never dieAll I can do is crySave a little prayer for the fallen oneThere is a light down at memory laneSlowly fading awayStill holding on to the dreams torn apartI will follow my heartOur love could never dieAll I can do is crySave a little prayer for the fallen oneStill on my own, chasing the sunOf a time long agoThe shade in my heart, tearing apartEverything that I long forStill on my own, chasing the sunOf a time long agoThe shade in my heart, tearing apartEverything that I long forI saw your face in the morning sunOh, I thought you were thereI heard your voice as the wind passed me byMhispering my nameOur love could never dieAll I can do is crySave a little prayer for the fallen oneOooh yeah.
