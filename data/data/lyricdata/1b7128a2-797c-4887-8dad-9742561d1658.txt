I saw your face in the morning sun Oh, I thought you were there I heard your voice as the wind passed me by Silently, whispering my name So many things that I wanted to say Forever left untold I still remember the tears that you shed Over someone else Our love could never die All I can do is cry Save a little prayer for the fallen one There is a light down at memory lane Slowly fading away Still holding on to the dreams torn apart I will follow my heart Our love could never die All I can do is cry Save a little prayer for the fallen one Still on my own, chasing the sun Of a time long ago The shade in my heart, tearing apart Everything that I long for Still on my own, chasing the sun Of a time long ago The shade in my heart, tearing apart Everything that I long for I saw your face in the morning sun Oh, I thought you were there I heard your voice as the wind passed me by Mhispering my name Our love could never die All I can do is cry Save a little prayer for the fallen one Oooh yeah.
