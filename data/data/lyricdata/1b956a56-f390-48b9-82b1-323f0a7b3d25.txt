You've denied me baby,The satisfaction of your love.So I've been walking home alone,Cause you left me out in the cold.(He left you out, now I'll take you home)I'll be here after midnight, wearing my beliquent frown.But you know it won't be long beforeI have to put your picture down.(Just take it down, you gave her up)I can't hear you baby,When you tell me you don't want me now.So I'll be hanging by the phone,Though I know you'll never make the call.(Don't make that call, he'll put you down)Call me in the daylight, speaking of a future planBut when you make demandsI know that I could never be your man(They're not demands, they're just the plans)One day baby, you'll realize that i know,(repeat 3x)I know, I know, I know, I know ..Before I knew you baby,I could have guessed that you'd be this way.But it wouldn't stop my love,Now I'm in a familiar place.(He lost the scene, there's something wrong)Feeling without re-costs,wish i could undo the time.I was walking home alone,So dejected by my own design.If its not over baby,For me boy this is just the start.I still got all my love to give,Enough love to fill your empty heart.(He emptied it, now fill it up)Caring without pretense, a picnic on the hillside,Clothes of many colors lying on the bedside,Tokens of a lifetimeMemories I wantedwanted, wanted, wanted, wanted ...Hear if you try, I'll tell you what you wanna(repeat 3x)wanna, wanna, wannaHear if you try, I'll tell you what you wanna(repeat 3x)wanna, wanna, wannaOne day baby, you'll realize that i know,(repeat 3x)I know, I know, I know, I know .
