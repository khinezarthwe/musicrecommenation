Something's wrong when you regretThings that haven't happened yetBut it's a glorious day when morning comesWithout that feeling of alarmSo rise and shineNow's the time to be aliveTo stay awake and be with me a whileAnd smileYou couldn't sleep for the awful frightThat kept you up in bed last nightWhile curious shapes shift in the darkThey vanish with the sunlight's sparkSo rise and shineNow's the time to be aliveTo stay awake with me a whileAnd smileSo rise and shineNow's the time to be aliveTo stay awake with me a whileSo rise and shineNow's the time to be aliveTo stay awake with me a whileAnd smile
