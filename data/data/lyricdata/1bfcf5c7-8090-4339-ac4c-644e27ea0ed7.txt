The night is gone, the time has comeTo find a new day has begunAnd it promises to stayTo soothe the pain of wasted yearsAnd kiss away the bitter tearsLove to light the wayAnd from the darkness comes a smileThat reaches out for many milesTouching everyoneNo more shadows of the pastYour spirit's free to fly at lastShining in the sunLike rolling thunderI feel the power of loveIt's a gift from HeavenAnd the Lord aboveWe walk toward desireHand and hand, through fields of fireWith only love to light the wayOn the road to Judgement DayTake it easy, take it slowI'll take you anywhere you wanna goPlaces never seen before'Cause I love you and I need youI'll do my best to please youMy love can open any doorWhen you hear the thunderIn your darkest nightI'll be there to hold youWhen the lightning strikesSo don't you worryYou can ease your mind'Cause we'll still be dancingAt the end of timeWho loves you, who needs youWho'll do his best to please youI love you and I need youI'll get down on my kneesWe walk toward desireHand and hand, through fields of fireWith only love to light the wayOn the road to Judgement DaySo don't you worry, babyOn the road to Judgement Day, oohWho loves you, who needs youOn the road to Judgement DaySo I love you and I need youMy love can open any doorMy love can open any door
