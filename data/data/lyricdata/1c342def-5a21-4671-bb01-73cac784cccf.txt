Hang on travelling womanDon’t sacrifice your planCause it will come back to youBefore you lose it on the manNever fall in love with potentialCause you can see with your own eyesAll the pretty faces and sorry wordsCan take away your prideGot to listenTo the visionSome may say a dreamWords from the unseen…Or it can make you tired, tell you lies and make you fallMake you tired, tell you lies, make you fallMake you tired, tell you lies, make you fallHang on travelling womanDon’t sacrifice your planCause it will come back to youBefore you lose it on the manGot to listenTo the visionPlay in the ashesOf what you once were…Got to listenTo the visionPlay in the ashesOf what you once were…
