Well, there were seven years between us Seems that all my friends were right That we can't survive on your bedroom eyes And a, a Spanish guitar When we started this it was paradise Not just Bethnal Green And it's just not right, this waiting game Making a cuckold of me I can be as cruel as you Fighting fire with firewood I can be as cruel as you Fighting lies with lies If you need time And It's just not like me to have shout But enough is enough Tell me what the others can do That I can't Translucent and sun-bleached skin Yeah, when did you get so L. A.? How can you desert me after What we've been through? Stuck on a dreamland Somewhere is better You'll be the one missing out I can be as cruel as you Fighting fire with firewood I can be as cruel as you Fighting lies with lies If you need time I can be as cruel as you Fighting fire with firewood( If you need time) I can be as cruel as you Fighting lies with lies If you need time, time, time Time, time, time I can be as cruel as you Fighting fire with firewood I can be as cruel as you Fighting lies with lies( If you need time) I can be as cruel as you Fighting fire with firewood I can be as cruel as you Fighting lies with lies I, I, I, I I, I, I, I I, I, I, I Haven't you words, you words? Fire with fire, fire, fire with fire Other, other, other word Eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes Eye
