High rise blocks out the blueThe pavement sticks like glueYou're getting nowhereHitch a ride on a wing and a prayerYou're crying out loudA face lost in the crowdA voice no-one can hearYou'll get by on a wing and a prayerSo let it beLet the breeze carry you to the seaLet the wind take you where it will go(You better believe it, love is everywhere)Rain, thunder, blowing down(And if you can feel it, you're halfway there)Feels like you're gonna drown(It's just another love song, ain't no big thing)Reach out, no one's there(Once you got the feeling, it makes you want to sing)Just hold on to a wing and a prayer(It's just a little homegrown philosophy)Like smoke in the air(Take it or leave it, it comes for free)You'll slowly slip away(It's just another love song, ain't no big thing)All senses prevail(Once you got the feeling, it makes you want to sing)You'll fly home on a wing and a prayerSo let it beLet the breeze carry you to the seaLet the wind take you where it will go(You better believe it, love is everywhere)Now you walk that high wire(And if you can feel it, you're halfway there)In truth you'll want to fly(It's just another love song, ain't no big thing)You'll fly everywhere(Once you got the feeling, it makes you want to sing)If you trust to a wing and a prayerSo let it beLet the breeze carry you to the seaLet the wind take you where it will goIt's just another love song, ain't no big thingOnce you got the feeling, it makes you want to singIt's just a little homegrown philosophyTake it or leave it, it comes for freeIf you trust to a wing and a prayerYou better believe it, love is everywhereAnd if you can feel it, you're halfway thereIt's just another love song, ain't no big thingOnce you got the feeling, it makes you want to singIf you trust to a wing and a prayerJust a little homegrown philosophyTake it or leave it, it comes for freeIt's just another love song, ain't no big thingOnce you got the feeling, it makes you want to sing...
