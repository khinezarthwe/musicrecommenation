Lord she's handsome as she flows across the floorNothing I've seen in my life has ever pleased me moreShe's got the look of freedom and it makes you think she's wildBut I can see right through it all, it's a way to hide a childOh walk awayShe's looking to love youThere's nothing to sayJust turn your head and walk awayWalk away, walk onShe moves in sunlight, never seen the night at allLike a star in the midnight sky burns before it fallsI've never been lonely and I can't imagine whyMaybe she can be the one to tell me, I guess it's do or dieCan't see her fireBut I can feel her heat, all rightIt's rising higherI'm walking the wireWalk on byOh walk awayShe's looking to love youThere's nothing to sayJust turn your head and walk awayOh walk on by, walk awayWalk on, walk on, walk on, walk awayYou'll feel her fireShe'll lift you higherBut don't be fooledJust turn your head and walk awayWalk away
