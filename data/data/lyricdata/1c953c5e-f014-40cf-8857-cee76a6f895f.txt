In my head, I am already goneSide roads pointed upDecisions decided onBut in my nights, there are restless hoursWhen three a.m. comes downAnd nothin' else comes upAnd the only thing we knowIs it's gettin' dark, and we'd better goAnd the only thing we seeAre the despairs of the dayAnd if you're too tiredGo to sleep, my brothers, I...And if you're too tiredGo to sleep, my brothers, I'm all right to driveBut in my heartI'm the weary kindI'm much too tired to cryThough it's sad enough for tearsIt's been try, fail, try for yearsWhen the next year comes alongI don't know if I'll be homeI don't know if we'll surviveAnd the only thing we knowIs it's gettin' dark, and we'd better goAnd the only thing we seeAre the despairs of the dayAnd if you're too tiredGo to sleep, my brothers, I...And if you're too tiredGo to sleep, my brothers, I'm all right to driveAnd we're much too young of menTo carry such heavy headsAnd tonight for the first timeIt felt good to be aliveAnd we're much too young of menTo carry such heavy headsAnd tonight for the first timeIt felt good to be alive again, my friendOnly thing we knowIs it's gettin' dark, and we'd better goAnd the only thing we seeAre the despairs of the dayAnd if you're too tiredGo to sleep, my brothers, I...And if you're too tiredGo to sleep, my brothers, I...And if you're too tiredGo to sleep, my brothers, I...And if you're too tiredGo to sleep, my brothers, I'm all right to drive
