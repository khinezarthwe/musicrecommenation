I called you after midnightThen ran until I burstI passed the howling womanAnd stood outside your doorWe walked around a lakeAnd woke up in the rainAnd everyone turned overTroubled in their dreams againVisiting time is overAnd so we walk awayWe both play dead, then cry out loudWhy we always cry this way?I kissed you in the waterAnd made your dry lips singI saw you look like a Japanese babyIn an instant I remembered everythingEverythingEverythingEverythingI called you after midnightThen ran until my heart burstI passed the howling womanAnd stood outside your doorI kissed you in the waterAnd made your dry lips singI saw you look like a Japanese babyIn an instant I remembered everythingEverythingEverythingEverything
