<On September 3rd 2003> I was softly touched by a warm summer breezeThere were blue tits flocking and swervingMy accuracy is quite unnervingI stole into a burnt, orange fieldWhich once was green, but lost its zealTo prance and dance and sing aroundWhich is not condoned in the centre of townChildren please beware!I'm choked with fearOh children please beware!I'm choked with fearChildren please beware!I'm choked with fearOh children please beware!I'm choked with fearAnd as I crunched those crispy leavesI walked towards a shaded treeTo find a young girl lying thereDrifting off without a careHer face was covered by a straw hat'Happy as Larry' and all of thatWhen I shouted out to wake her upShe was skipping school in the burning hotChildren please beware!I'm choked with fearOh children please beware!I'm choked with fearChildren please beware!I'm choked with fearOh children please beware!I'm choked with fearAnd as I tried to get her to speakI realised that she was not asleepI moved her hat to find that her face was greyHer knickers wrapped around her anklesIt's not funny!Children please beware!I'm choked with fearOh children please beware!I'm choked with fearChildren please beware!I'm choked with fearOh children please beware!I'm choked with fearSwamped with fear...Drown in fear...
