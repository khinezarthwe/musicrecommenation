< On September 3rd 2003> I was softly touched by a warm summer breeze There were blue tits flocking and swerving My accuracy is quite unnerving I stole into a burnt, orange field Which once was green, but lost its zeal To prance and dance and sing around Which is not condoned in the centre of town Children please beware! I'm choked with fear Oh children please beware! I'm choked with fear Children please beware! I'm choked with fear Oh children please beware! I'm choked with fear And as I crunched those crispy leaves I walked towards a shaded tree To find a young girl lying there Drifting off without a care Her face was covered by a straw hat' Happy as Larry' and all of that When I shouted out to wake her up She was skipping school in the burning hot Children please beware! I'm choked with fear Oh children please beware! I'm choked with fear Children please beware! I'm choked with fear Oh children please beware! I'm choked with fear And as I tried to get her to speak I realised that she was not asleep I moved her hat to find that her face was grey Her knickers wrapped around her ankles It's not funny! Children please beware! I'm choked with fear Oh children please beware! I'm choked with fear Children please beware! I'm choked with fear Oh children please beware! I'm choked with fear Swamped with fear... Drown in fear...
