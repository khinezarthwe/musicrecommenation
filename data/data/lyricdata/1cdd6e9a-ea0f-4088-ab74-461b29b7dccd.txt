You're the prince to my ballerinaYou feed other people's parking metersYou encourage the eating of ice creamYou would somersault in sand with meYou talk to loners, you ask "how's your week?"You give love to all and give love to meYou're obsessed with hiding the sticks and stonesWhen I feel the unknownYou feel like home, you feel like homeYou put my feet back on the groundDid you know you brought me home?You were sweet and you were soundYou saved meYou're the warmth in my summer breezeYou're the ivory to my ebony keysYou would share your last jelly beanAnd you would somersault in sand with meYou put my feet back on the groundDid you know you brought me home?Yeah, you were sweet and you were soundYou saved meYou put my feet back on the groundDid you know you brought me home?Yeah, you were sweet and you were soundSee I had shrunk, yet still you wore me aroundAnd around and around
