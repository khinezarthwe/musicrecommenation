Love is a strangerIn an open carTo tempt you inAnd drive you far away (2x)And I want youAnd I want youAnd I want you soIt's an obsession (2x)Love is a dangerOf a different kindTo take you awayAnd leave you far behindAnd love love loveIs a dangerous drugYou have to receive itAnd you still can'tGet enough of the stuffIt's savage and it's cruelAnd it shines like destructionComes in like the floodAnd it seems like religionIt's noble and it's brutalIt distorts and derangesAnd it wrenches you upAnd you're left like a zombieAnd I want youAnd I want youAnd I want you soIt's an obsessionIt's guilt edgedGlamorous and sleek by designYou know it's jealous by natureFalse and unkindIt's hard and restrainedAnd it's totally coolIt touches and it teasesAs you stumble in the debrisAnd I want youAnd I want youAnd I want you soIt's an obsession (4x)
