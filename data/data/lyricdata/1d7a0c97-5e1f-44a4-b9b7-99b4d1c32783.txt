I'm tired of bars in BostonBeen feeling small in New YorkScared of guns in HoustonAnd tired of business talkDon't want to talk about it, babyDon't want to get in no fightI just want to go to a rock androll showAnd shiver and shake all nightThere's a riot in the HyattAnd madness in the Holiday InnSo throw your big leg over me, babeI might not feel this good againCrazyThe road can make you crazyMakes you boldAnd get coldCold in your jelly rollSo won't youTake me back to sunny days againI won't be leaving until the summer endsLeave me in the company of friendsI left behind me many miles awayHere, there, everywhereNo doubt about it, I had my sharePaid my dues, got my rock and roll shoesAnd thats all right?But I never, never, neverThought I'd see the dayWhen I'd be dancing aloneSo take me where the musicTake me where the music playThen you canTake me back to sunny days againI won't be leaving until the summer endsLeave me in the company of friendsI left behind me many, oh so manyI left behind me many miles away
