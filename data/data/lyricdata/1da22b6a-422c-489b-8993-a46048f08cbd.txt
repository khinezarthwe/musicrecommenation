There's nothing to do so you just stay in bed,(oh poor thing). Why live in the worldwhen you can live in your head? And you can go out late from Mondaytill Saturday turns into Sundayand now you're back here at Mondayso we can do it all over again. And now you go aah ah ah (etc) I want a refund, I want a light, I want a reason to make it thru the night. Alright. And so you finally left school,so now what are you going to do? Now you're so grown up,yeah you're oh so mature. Going out late from Monday,chuck up in the street on Sunday,you don't want to live till Mondayand have to do it all again. And you go aah ah ah (etc) I want a refund, I want a light, I want a reason for all thisnight after night after night after night. Oh I know that it's stupidbut I just can't seem to spend a night at home'cos me friends left townand I'm here all alone. Oh yeah they said the past must diefor the future to be born,in that case die little mother. Stomach in. Chest out. On your marks. Get set. Go. Now, now that you're freewhat are you going to be? And who are you going to see? And where,where will you goand how will you knowyou didn't get it all wrong? Is this the light of a new day dawning? A future bright that you can walk in? No, it's just another Monday morning. Do it all over again oh baby. La la la la la la, (etc). Do do, do do do do (etc).
