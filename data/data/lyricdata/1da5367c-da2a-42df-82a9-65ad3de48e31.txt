When you're taught through feelings... Destiny flying high above All I know is that you can realize it Destiny who cares as it turns around And I know that it descends down on me Just another day The shame is gone Hard to believe That I’ve let it go Destiny can't replace my life Scary shadows of my past are alive Destiny who cares as it turns around And I know that it descends with a smile Just another day The shame is gone It's hard to believe That I’ve let it go It's just a melody It bleeds in me Hard to believe That I’ve let it go When you're taught through feelings... Just another day The shame is gone It's hard to believe That I’ve let it go away It's just a melody It bleeds in me It's hard to believe That I’ve let it go, let it go, let it go
