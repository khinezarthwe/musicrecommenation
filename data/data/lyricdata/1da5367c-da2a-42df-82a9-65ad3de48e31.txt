When you're taught through feelings...Destiny flying high aboveAll I know is that you can realize itDestiny who cares as it turns aroundAnd I know that it descends down on meJust another dayThe shame is goneHard to believeThat I’ve let it goDestiny can't replace my lifeScary shadows of my past are aliveDestiny who cares as it turns aroundAnd I know that it descends with a smileJust another dayThe shame is goneIt's hard to believeThat I’ve let it goIt's just a melodyIt bleeds in meHard to believeThat I’ve let it goWhen you're taught through feelings...Just another dayThe shame is goneIt's hard to believeThat I’ve let it go awayIt's just a melodyIt bleeds in meIt's hard to believeThat I’ve let it go, let it go, let it go
