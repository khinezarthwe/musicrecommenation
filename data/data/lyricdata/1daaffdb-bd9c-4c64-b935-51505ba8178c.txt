( You're not doing this alone)( You're not doing, not doing this alone) For my sweetheart, the melancholic You have crossed the River Styx And the waves have taken you away As I lay my head on your chest I can hear it in your veins Wake me up when you come to bed So toughen up Biko, toughen up Biko, toughen up This world isn't kind to little things( You're not doing this alone) Was my love not strong enough To bring you back from the dead? If I could eat your cancer, I would, but I can't( You're not doing this alone) So I keep writing these songs for you To steal you from your grey And we can dance in our front room again So toughen up Biko, toughen up Biko, toughen up I need you to be strong for us So toughen up Biko, toughen up Biko, toughen up This world isn't kind to little things( You're not doing this alone) Don't you know that when you stand You stand up for the both of us? Remember that when the darkness looms( You're not doing this alone) Every tear you shed is cleansing Taking the pain away from you I left you blueberries in the fridge The little things that I can do So toughen up (that I can do) Biko, toughen up (that I can do) Biko, toughen up (that I can do) I need you to be strong for us So toughen up Biko, toughen up Biko, toughen up This world isn't kind to little things( You're not doing this alone)( You're not doing this alone)( You're not, not)( You're not doing this alone)( You're not doing this alone)( You're not doing this alone)( You're not doing this alone)( You're not doing this alone) Resist Resist Resist Resist So toughen up (resist) Biko, toughen up (resist) Biko, toughen up (resist) I need you to be strong for us (resist) So toughen up (resist) Biko, toughen up (resist) Biko, toughen up (resist) This world isn't kind to little things (resist)( You're not doing this alone)( You're not doing, not doing this alone)
