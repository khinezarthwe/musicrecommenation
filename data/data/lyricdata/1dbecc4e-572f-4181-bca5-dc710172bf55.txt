Galveston, oh GalvestonI still hear your sea winds blowingI still see her dark eyes glowingShe was 21When I left GalvestonGalveston, oh GalvestonI still hear your sea waves crashingWhile I watch the cannons flashingI clean my gunAnd dream of GalvestonI still see her standing by the waterStanding there looking out to seaAnd is she waiting there for me?On the beach where we used to runGalveston, oh GalvestonI am so afraid of dyingBefore I dry the tears she's cryingBefore I watch your sea birds flying in the sunAt Galveston, at Galveston
