Galveston, oh Galveston I still hear your sea winds blowing I still see her dark eyes glowing She was 21 When I left Galveston Galveston, oh Galveston I still hear your sea waves crashing While I watch the cannons flashing I clean my gun And dream of Galveston I still see her standing by the water Standing there looking out to sea And is she waiting there for me? On the beach where we used to run Galveston, oh Galveston I am so afraid of dying Before I dry the tears she's crying Before I watch your sea birds flying in the sun At Galveston, at Galveston
