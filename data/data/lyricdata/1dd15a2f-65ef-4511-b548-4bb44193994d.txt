Open the curtain,Let some light in,I feel so grey,The world got smashed to pieces,And put back togetherThe wrong way.Why you leaving me now?There must be some doubt in your mind,Can't you open your heart?Don't want to be left behind.Open the window,Let some air in,I feel so oldThere - Where we were happy,Long agoYesterday.Why you leaving me now?There must be some doubt in your mind,Can't you open your heart?Don't want to be left behind.You open your mouth and I knowwhat you're going to say.Open the window,Let some air in,I feel so grey.Why you leaving me now?There must be some doubt in your mind,Can't you open your heart?Don't want to be left behind.You open your mouth and I knowwhat you're going to say.
