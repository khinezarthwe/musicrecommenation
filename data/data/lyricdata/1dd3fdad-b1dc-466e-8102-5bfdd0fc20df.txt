I see nothing in your eyesAnd the more I see the less I likeIs it over yet, in my head?I know nothing of your kindAnd I won't reveal your evil mindIs it over yet? I can't waitSo sacrifice yourself and let me have what's leftI know that I can find the fire in your eyesI'm going all the way, get away, pleaseYou take the breath right out of meYou left a hole where my heart should beYou gotta fight just to make it through'Cause I will be the death of youThis will be all over soonPour the salt into the open woundIs it over yet? Let me inSo sacrifice yourself and let me have what's leftI know that I can find the fire in your eyesI'm going all the way, get away, pleaseYou take the breath right out of meYou left a hole where my heart should beYou gotta fight just to make it through'Cause I will be the death of youI'm waiting, I'm prayingRealize, start hatingYou take the breath right out of meYou left a hole where my heart should beYou gotta fight just to make it through'Cause I will be the death of you
