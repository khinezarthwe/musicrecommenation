Ooh, ooh, ooh, oohYeah, ooh, ooh, sweet love, yeahI didn't mean itWhen I said I didn't love you soI should have held on tightI never should have let you goI didn't know nothingI was stupid, I was foolishI was lying to myselfI could not fathom that I would everBe without your loveNever imagined I'd beSitting here beside myself'Cause I didn't know you'Cause I didn't know meBut I thought I knew everythingI never feltThe feeling that I'm feelingNow that I don't hear your voiceOr have your touch and kiss your lips'Cause I don't have a choiceOh, what I wouldn't giveTo have you lying by my sideRight here 'cause, babyWhen you left I lost a part of meIt's still so hard to believeCome back, baby, please'Cause we belong togetherWho else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up?Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody betterOh, baby baby, we belong togetherI can't sleep at nightWhen you are on my mindBobby Womack's on the radio saying to me,Wait a minute, this is too deepI gotta change the stationSo I turn the dial, trying to catch a breakAnd then I hear BabyfaceI only think of you and it's breaking my heartI'm trying to keep it together but I'm falling apartI'm feeling all out of my elementI'm throwing things, cryingTrying to figure out where the hell I went wrongThe pain reflected in this songIt ain't even half of what I'm feeling insideI need you, need you back in my life, babyWhen you left I lost a part of meIt's still so hard to believeCome back baby, please'Cause we belong togetherWho else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up?Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody betterOh, baby baby, we belong together, babyWhen you left I lost a part of meIt's still so hard to believeCome back baby, please'Cause we belong togetherWho am I gonna lean on when times get rough?Who's gonna talk to me till the sun comes up?Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody betterOh baby, baby, we belong together
