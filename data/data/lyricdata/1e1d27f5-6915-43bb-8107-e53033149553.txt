I don't know where I'm goingBut I sure know where I've beenHanging on the promises in the songs of yesterdayAnd I've made up my mindI ain't wasting no more timeHere I go againHere I go againThough I keep searching for an answerI never seem to find what I'm looking forOh Lord, I pray you give me strength to carry on\'Cause I know what it meansTo walk along the lonely street of dreamsHere I go again on my ownGoin' down the only road I've ever knownLike a drifter I was born to walk aloneAnd I've made up my mindI ain't wasting no more timeI'm just another heart in need of rescueWaiting on love's sweet charityAnd I'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days'Cause I know what it meansTo walk along the lonely street of dreamsAnd here I go again on my ownGoin' down the only road I've ever knownLike a drifter I was born to walk aloneAnd I've made up my mindI ain't wasting no more timeBut here I go againHere I go againHere I go againHere I go'Cause I know what it meansTo walk along the lonely street of dreamsAnd here I go again on my ownGoin' down the only road I've ever knownLike a drifter I was born to walk aloneAnd I've made up my mindI ain't wasting no more timeAnd here I go again on my ownGoin' down the only road I've ever knownLike a drifter I was born to walk alone'Cause I know what it meansTo walk along the lonely street of dreamsAnd here I go again on my ownGoin' down the only road I've ever knownLike a drifter I was born to walk alone
