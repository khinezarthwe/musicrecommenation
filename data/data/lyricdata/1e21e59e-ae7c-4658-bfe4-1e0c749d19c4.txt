When the men take me to the devil tree I will be free and shining like before Papa, don't tell me what I should have done She's the one, she's the one who begged me Take me Take me home When the wind wraps me like the reaper's hand I will swing free until they cut me down Papa, don't tell me what I could have done She's the one, she's the one who begged me Take me Take me home When the sea takes me like my mother's arms I will breathe free as any word of God Papa, don't tell me what you would have done She's the one, she's the one who begged me Take me Take me home
