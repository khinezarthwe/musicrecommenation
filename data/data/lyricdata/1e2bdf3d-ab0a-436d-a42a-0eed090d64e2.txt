I cried on my blood dayThere was nothing that I could hold on toJust a line could have helpedRemind me of you, of youI screamed till the blood cameI was living in a cloud of hopeLover's kiss then they make a wish to the endThey pretend'Cause everyday hurts a little moreAnd everyday hurts a little moreAnd I'll do anything, yes I'll do anythingTo belong to be strongTo say there's nothing wrongEveryday hurts a little moreYes everyday hurts a little moreAnd I'll be anything, yes I'll be anythingTo belong to be strongTo say there's nothing wrongEveryday hurtsEveryday hurtsEveryday hurtsI cried in the sunlightWould I fake all the times I loved youJust a play in a game I twisted with you, with youI need to believe youSacrificed all the lies we made upHow we kissedThen we made our wish to the endTo the end'Cause everyday hurts a little moreAnd everyday hurts a little moreAnd I'll do anything, yes I'll do anythingTo belong to be strongTo say there's nothing wrongEveryday hurts a little moreYes everyday hurts a little moreAnd I'll be anything, yes I'll be anythingTo belong to be strongTo say there's nothing wrongEveryday hurtsEveryday hurtsEveryday hurtsTime made me confide in youSo contrived were the words you sold meNow nothing can swallowThe feeling so shallow inside'Cause everyday hurts a little moreAnd everyday hurts a little moreAnd I'll do anything, yes I'll do anythingTo belong to be strongTo say there's nothing wrongEveryday hurts a little moreYes everyday hurts a little moreAnd I'll be anything, yes I'll be anythingTo belong to be strongTo say there's nothing wrongEveryday hurtsEveryday hurtsEveryday hurts
