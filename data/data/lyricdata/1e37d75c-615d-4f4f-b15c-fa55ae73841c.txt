She was born in November 1963The day Aldous Huxley diedAnd her mama believedThat every man could be freeSo her mama got high, high, highAnd her daddy marched on BirminghamSinging mighty protest songsAnd he pictured all the placesWhere he knew that she'd belongBut he failed and taught her youngThe only thing she'd need to carry onHe taught her how toRun baby, run baby, run baby, run baby, runSo run baby, run baby, run baby, run baby, runPast the arms of the familiarAnd their talk of better daysTo the comfort of the strangersSlipping out before they say "so long"Baby loves to runShe counts out all her moneyIn the taxi on the way to meet her planeAnd stares hopeful out the windowAt the workers fighting through the pouring rainAnd she's searching through the stationsFor an unfamiliar songAnd she's thinkin' 'bout the placesWhere she knows she still belongsShe smiles the secret smileThat shows she knows exactly how to carry onSo run baby, run baby, run baby, run baby, runSo run baby, run baby, run baby, run baby, runFrom the old familiar facesAnd their old familiar waysTo the comfort of the strangersSlipping out before they say "so long"Baby loves to runAnd she's searchin' through the stationsFor an unfamiliar songAnd she pictures all the placesWhere she knows she still belongsAnd she smiles the secret smileBecause she knows exactly how to carry onSo run baby, run baby, run baby, run baby, runSo run baby, run baby, run baby, run baby, runSo run baby, run baby, run baby, run baby, runSo run baby, run baby, run baby, run baby, runSo run baby, run baby, run baby, run baby, run
