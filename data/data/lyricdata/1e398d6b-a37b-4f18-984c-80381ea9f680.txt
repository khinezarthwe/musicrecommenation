Where is the sea?I don't know why, I was just looking for the seaBut the only thing I found was a desertA desert around meWhat can I see?You close my eyes when I just need to go and seeIf you want me to be blind, I will stay hereWith this desert around meThe world I can see is a nowhere landWithout you, I'm a nowhere girlIn the desertIn the desert with youWhere is the sea?I don't know why, I was just looking for the seaBut the only thing I found was a desertA desert around meWhere is the sea?I am alone. I am dreaming of the seaBut you are not here next to meThe world I can see is a nowhere landWithout you, I'm a nowhere girlIn the desertIn the desert with you
