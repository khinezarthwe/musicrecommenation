Where is the sea? I don't know why, I was just looking for the sea But the only thing I found was a desert A desert around me What can I see? You close my eyes when I just need to go and see If you want me to be blind, I will stay here With this desert around me The world I can see is a nowhere land Without you, I'm a nowhere girl In the desert In the desert with you Where is the sea? I don't know why, I was just looking for the sea But the only thing I found was a desert A desert around me Where is the sea? I am alone. I am dreaming of the sea But you are not here next to me The world I can see is a nowhere land Without you, I'm a nowhere girl In the desert In the desert with you
