It's the cruelest joke to playI'm so high I run in placeOnly a line we separateSoI keep on playin' our favorite songI turn it up, while you're goneIt's all I've got when you're in my headAnd you're in my head, so I need itYou're the only thing I've gotThat I can't seem to get enoughWe collide for one embraceSoI keep on playin' our favorite songI turn it up, while you're goneIt's all I've got when you're in my headAnd you're in my head, so I need itI keep on playin' our favorite songI turn it up, while you're goneIt's all I've got when you're in my headAnd you're in my head, so I need itMy radio, I can't wait foreverI keep on playin' our favorite songI turn it up, while you're goneIt's all I've got when you're in my headAnd you're in my head, so I need itI keep on playin' our favorite songI turn it up, while you're goneIt's all I've got when you're in my headAnd you're in my head, so I need itI need itI need itI need it now
