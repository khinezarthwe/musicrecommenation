The way you moveHas got me yearningThe way you moveHas left me burningI know you know what you're doing to meI know my hands will never be freeI know what it's like to be in chainsThe way you moveIs meant to haunt meThe way you moveTo tempt and taunt meI know you knew on the day you were bornI know somehow I should've been warnedI know I walk every midnight to dawn in chainsIn chainsI'm in chainsYou've got me dying for you, it's you that I'm living throughYou've got me praying to you, saying to you anything you want me toYou've got me reaching for you, my soul's beseeching me tooYou've got me singing to you, bringing to you anything you ask me toThe way you moveIs mesmerizingThe way you moveIs hypnotizingI know I crumble when you are aroundStutter, mumble a pitiful soundStagger, stumble shackled and bound in chainsIn chainsI'm in chainsYou've got me dying for you, it's you that I'm living throughYou've got me praying to you, saying to you anything you want me toYou've got me reaching for you, my soul's beseeching me tooYou've got me singing to you, bringing to you anything you ask me toI'm in chainsIn chainsI'm in chains
