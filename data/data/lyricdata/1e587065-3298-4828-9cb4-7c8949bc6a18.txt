Love, let me sleep tonight on your couch And remember the smell of the fabric Of your simple city dress Oh, That was so real Oh, That was so real Oh, That was so real We walked around til the moon got full like a plate The wind blew an invocation And I fell asleep at the gate And I never stepped on the cracks' Cause I thought I'd hurt my mother And I couldn't awake from the nightmare That sucked me in and pulled me under Pulled me under Oh, That was so real Oh, That was so real Oh, That was so real I love you But I'm afraid to love you I love you But I'm afraid to love you I'm afraid Oh, That was so real Oh, That was so real Oh, That was so real So real Oh, That was so real Real, real, real Oh, That was so real Oh, That was so real( Oh yeah) Oh, That was so real
