Love, let me sleep tonight on your couchAnd remember the smell of the fabricOf your simple city dressOh, That was so realOh, That was so realOh, That was so realWe walked around til the moon got full like a plateThe wind blew an invocationAnd I fell asleep at the gateAnd I never stepped on the cracks'Cause I thought I'd hurt my motherAnd I couldn't awake from the nightmareThat sucked me in and pulled me underPulled me underOh, That was so realOh, That was so realOh, That was so realI love youBut I'm afraid to love youI love youBut I'm afraid to love youI'm afraidOh, That was so realOh, That was so realOh, That was so realSo realOh, That was so realReal, real, realOh, That was so realOh, That was so real(Oh yeah)Oh, That was so real
