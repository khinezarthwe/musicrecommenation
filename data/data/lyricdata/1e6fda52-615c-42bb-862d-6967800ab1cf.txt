Ever since I was a young boyI've played the silver ballFrom Soho down to BrightonI must have played them allBut I ain't seen nothing like himIn any amusement hallThat deaf, dumb and blind kidSure plays a mean pinballHe stands like a statueBecomes part of the machineFeeling all the bumpersAlways playing cleanPlays by intuitionThe digit counters fallThat deaf, dumb and blind kidSure plays a mean pinballHe's a pinball wizardThere has to be a twistA pinball wizard'sGot such a supple wristHow do you think he does it?I don't know!What makes him so good?Ain't got no distractionsCan't hear no buzzers and bellsDon't see no lights are flashin'Plays by sense of smellAlways gets a replayNever seen him fallThat deaf, dumb and blind kidSure plays a mean pinballI thought I wasThe Bally table kingBut I just handedMy pinball crown to himEven on my favorite tableHe can beat my bestHis disciples lead him inAnd he just does the restHe's got crazy flipper fingersNever seen him fallThat deaf, dumb and blind kidSure plays a mean pinball
