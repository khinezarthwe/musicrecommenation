I've used hammers made out of woodI have played games with pieces and rulesI've deciphered tricks at the barBut now you're gone I haven't figured out whyI've come up with riddles and jokes about warI figured out numbers and what they're forI've understood feelings and I've understood wordsBut how could you be taken away?And wherever you've gone and wherever we might goIt don't seem fair, today just disappearedYour light's reflected now, reflected from afarWe were but stones, your light made us starsWith heavy breath, awakened regretsBack pages and days alone that could have been spentTogether, but we were miles apartEvery inch between us becomes light years nowNo time to be void or save up on lifeOh, you got to spend it allAnd wherever you've gone and wherever we might goIt don't seem fair, you seemed to like it hereYour light's reflected now, reflected from afarWe were but stones, your light made us starsAnd wherever you've gone and wherever we might goIt don't seem fair, today just disappearedYour light's reflected now, reflected from afarWe were but stones, your light made us stars
