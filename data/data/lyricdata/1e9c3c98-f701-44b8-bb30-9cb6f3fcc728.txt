I wish I'd see a field belowI wish I'd hear a rooster crowBut there are none who live downtownAnd so the day starts out so slowAgain the sun was never calledAnd darkness spreads over the snowLike ancient bruisesI'm awake and feel the acheBut I wish I'd see a field belowI wish I'd see a field belowI wish I'd see your face belowI wish I'd hear you whispering lowBut you don't live downtown no moreAnd everything must come and goAgain the sun was never calledAnd darkness spreads over the snowLike ancient bruisesI'm awake and feel the acheI'm awake and feel the acheBut I wish I'd see a field belowI wish I'd see a field belowI'm awake and I feel the acheOh, but I wish I'd see a field belowI'm awake and feel the acheAw, but I wish I'd see a field belowI wish I'd see a field belowI wish I'd see a field below
