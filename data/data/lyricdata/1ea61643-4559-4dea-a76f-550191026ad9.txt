And so she woke upWoke up from whereShe was lying still.Said I gotta do something aboutWhere we're going.Step on a steam trainStep out of the driving rainMaybeRun from the darknessIn the night.Singing ah,Ah la la la de dayAh la la la de dayAh la la de day.Sweet the sinBitter the tasteIn my mouth.I see seven towersBut I only seeOne way out.You gotta cry without weepingTalk without speakingScream without raisingYour voice.You knowI took the poisonFrom the poison streamThen I floated out of here, singingAh la la la de dayAh la la la de dayAh la la de day.She roams through the streetsWith her eyes painted redUnder black bellyOf cloud in the rain.In through a doorwayShe brings meWhite golden pearlsStolen from the sea.She is ragin'She is ragin'And the storm blows upIn her eyes.She will suffer the needle chillShe's running to stand still
