A legacy so far removed one day will be improvedEternal rights we left behind; we were the better kindTwo the same, set free too. I always looked to youI always looked to youI always looked to youWe fought for good, stood side by side. Our friendship never diedOn stranger waves, the lows and highs. Our vision touched the skyImmortalists with points to prove; I put my trust in youI put my trust in youI put my trust in youA house somewhere on foreign soil where aging lovers callIs this your goal, your final needs? Where dogs and vultures eatCommitted still, I turn to go. I put my trust in youI put my trust in youI put my trust in youI put my trust in youIn you, in you, in youPut my trust in you, in you
