There's a lightning storm each and every nightCrashing inside you like motorbikesWe toss and turn, sleep so loudGrind the teeth in our empty mouthsAre empty...There's a forest fire burning brightSpreading quickly towards our last ritesNowhere to run, pointless to hideJust lay there and scream, pretending to tryPretending...Intending to burn, pretending to fight itEveryone learns faster on fireThings took a turn, lost all desireYou live and you burnThis impending doom is left deep insideAnd it's haunting you each and every nightLike starving wolves counting sheepWe close our eyes, pretending to sleepDescending...Intending to burn, pretending to fight itEveryone learns faster on fireThings took a turn, lost all desireYou live and you burn - you live and you burnYou live and like hell, we are anxiously waitingLike hell, burning silently strongSomehow we fell down by the waysideAnd somehow this hell is homeAs we burn, pretending to fight itEveryone learns faster on fireThings took a turn, lost all desireYou live and you burnyou live and you...like hell, we are anxiously waitingLike hell, burning silently strongSomehow we fell down by the waysideAnd somehow this hell is homeRight now, this hell is my home
