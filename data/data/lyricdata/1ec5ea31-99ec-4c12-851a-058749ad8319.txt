I was spending my time in the doldrumsI was caught in a cauldron of hateI felt persecuted and paralysedI thought that everything else would just waitWhile you are wasting your time on your enemiesEngulfed in a fever of spiteBeyond your tunnel vision reality fadesLike shadows into the nightTo martyr yourself to cautionIs not going to help at all'Cause there'll be no safety in numbersWhen the right one walks out of the doorCan you see your days blighted by darkness?Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?Stuck in a world of isolationWhile the ivy grows over the doorSo I open my door to my enemiesAnd I ask could we wipe the slate cleanBut they tell me to please go fuck myselfYou know you just can't win.
