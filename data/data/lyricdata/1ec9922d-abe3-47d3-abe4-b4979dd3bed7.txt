Alright so this is a song about anyone, it could be anyoneYou're just doing your own thing and someone comes out of the blueThey're like,"AlrightWhat are ya saying?Yeah can I take your digits?"And you're like, "No not in a million years, you're nastyPlease leave me alone"Cut to the pub on a lad's night outMan at the bar cause it was his shoutClocks this bird and she looked OKShe caught him looking and walked his way"Alright darlin', you gonna buy us a drink then?""Er no, but I was thinking about buying one for your friend..."She's got no taste, hand on his waistTries to pull away but her lips on his face"If you insist I'll have a white wine spritzer""Sorry love, but you ain't a pretty picture"You can't knock 'em out, you can't walk awayTry desperately to think of the politest way to sayJust get out my face, just leave me aloneAnd no you can't have my number"Why?"Cause I lost my phone"Oh yeah, actually yeah um, I'm pregnantUm, yeah I'm having a baby in like 6 months so no, yeah, yeah..."I recognize this guy's way of thinkingAs he walks over her face starts sinkingShe's like,"Oh here we go..."It's a routine check that she already knows,She's thinking, "They're all the same""Yeah you alright baby? You look alright still, yeah what's your name?"She looks in her bag, takes out a fagTries to get away from the guy on a blag, can't find a light"Here, use mine""You see the thing is I just don't have the time"You can't knock 'em out, you can't walk awayTry desperately to think of the politest way to sayJust get out my face, just leave me aloneAnd no you can't have my numberCause I lost my phoneGo away now, let me goAre you stupid? Or just a little slow?Go away now, I've made myself clearNah, it's not gonna happenNot in a million yearsYou can't knock 'em out, you can't walk awayTry desperately to think of the politest way to sayJust get out my face, just leave me aloneAnd no you can't have my numberCause I lost my phoneYou can't knock 'em out, you can't walk awayTry desperately to think of the politest way to sayJust get out my face, just leave me aloneAnd no you can't have my numberCause I lost my phone"Actually I'm getting married next week""No, seriously""Nah, I've gotta go; my house is on fire""I've got, I've got herpes, err no, syphilis! AIDS! AIDS, I've got AIDS."
