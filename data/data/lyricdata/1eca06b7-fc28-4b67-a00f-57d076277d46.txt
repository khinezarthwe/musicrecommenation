I know, I know the sun is hot Mosquitoes come, suck your blood Leave you there all alone Just skin and bone When you walk among the trees Listening to the leaves The further I go, the less I know The less I know Where will you run? Where will you hide? Lullabies To paralyze Fat and soft, pink and weak Foot and thigh, tongue and cheek You know, I'm told they swallow you whole Skin and bone Cutting boards and hanging hooks Bloody knives, cooking books Promising you won't feel a thing At all Swallow and chew Eat you alive All of us food That hasn't died And the knife says Separate, pick and pluck Tenderize bone to dust The sweetest grease, finest meat You'll ever taste (taste, taste) So you scream, whine, and yell Supple sounds, a dinner bell We all will feed the worms and trees So don't be shy Swallow and chew Eat you alive All of us food That hasn't died
