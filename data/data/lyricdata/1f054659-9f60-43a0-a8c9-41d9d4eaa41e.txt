We can insist on havoc, bring me tools, bolts are intact You said "leave me for dead", how can you love? Program the head We get so fed up with it, nuts and bolts for granted Made outta iron, I can do it as your bodies fall apart Robotic love, I'm programmed to moan A I D S robot is grinding iron bolts Robot hunks have one agenda, they wanna play with my placenta Are we now deserving when our cyborg parts are burning I know we're just diseased appliances Where will you live? What will you die for? Sex is killing me Baby, I know, wrong time, wrong place, wrong fucking race Just because we don't feel flesh, doesn't mean we don't fear death
