We can insist on havoc, bring me tools, bolts are intactYou said "leave me for dead", how can you love? Program the headWe get so fed up with it, nuts and bolts for grantedMade outta iron, I can do it as your bodies fall apartRobotic love, I'm programmed to moanAIDS robot is grinding iron boltsRobot hunks have one agenda, they wanna play with my placentaAre we now deserving when our cyborg parts are burningI know we're just diseased appliancesWhere will you live? What will you die for? Sex is killing meBaby, I know, wrong time, wrong place, wrong fucking raceJust because we don't feel flesh, doesn't mean we don't fear death
