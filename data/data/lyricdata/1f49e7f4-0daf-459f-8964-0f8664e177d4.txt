Here's the silhouette, the face always turned awayThe bleeding color gone to blackDying like a dayCouldn't figure out what made you so unhappyShook your head to say "no, no, no"And stopped for a spellAnd stayed that wayOh well, okayI got pictures, I just don't see it anymoreClimbing hour upon hour through a total boreWith the one I keep where it never fadesIn the safety of a pitch black mindAn airless cell that blocks the dayOh well, okayIf you a get a feeling the next time you see meDo me a favor and let me know'Cause it's hard to tellIt's hard to sayOh well, okayOh well, okayOh well, okay
