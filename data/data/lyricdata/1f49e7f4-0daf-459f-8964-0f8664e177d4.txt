Here's the silhouette, the face always turned away The bleeding color gone to black Dying like a day Couldn't figure out what made you so unhappy Shook your head to say "no, no, no" And stopped for a spell And stayed that way Oh well, okay I got pictures, I just don't see it anymore Climbing hour upon hour through a total bore With the one I keep where it never fades In the safety of a pitch black mind An airless cell that blocks the day Oh well, okay If you a get a feeling the next time you see me Do me a favor and let me know' Cause it's hard to tell It's hard to say Oh well, okay Oh well, okay Oh well, okay
