Music of a southern day and the nectar of brass Spilling into Congo Square where the queens used to pass There lies no greater place for one left to drift And there hides no greater lie and no bigger myth And in the heat of crackdown all is silent Just before the match is struck and the gas is poured along roads But in the heat of crackdown all is silent underneath Gunned down in the drive a foreign exchange Student from Japan whose fate it was shortchanged You saw it all when it made the national news How the isolated incident occured in Baton Rouge And in the heat of crackdown all is silent Just before the match is struck and the gas is poured along roads But in the heat of crackdown all is silent underneath And it's a crackdown on beliefs Everyone watching The events from the sky No bodies touching Don't wish to prize Into our own lives Into our own Terrorism terrify tear the truth in two Seeks to paralyze weaken turn the screws But only cowards could create the O K bomb' Cause no bomb is O K when there can be no calm And in the heat of crackdown all is silent While the voice of power over roars condemns the songs of Innocence and finally it's a crackdown on beliefs Oh it's a crackdown on beliefs And it's a crackdown on beliefs Oh oh oh And this is a crackdown on beliefs (na na na na) Will you have a crackdown on beliefs (na na na na) This a crackdown on beliefs This is a crackdown This is a crackdown This is a crackdown This is a crackdown
