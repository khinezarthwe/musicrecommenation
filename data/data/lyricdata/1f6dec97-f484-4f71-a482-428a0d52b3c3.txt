I cannot be all these things to you. It's true.My arms hang down, my legs don't fight,My fingers believing for you and for me,But no way I, I cannot be all these things to you.The future is yours, so fill this part in.The future is yours, so fill this part in.The future is yours, so fill this part in.I turn this moment into something new, It's true.Are you ready, to feel alive?The ancient echoes crawling out from my insidesNo way I, I cannot be all these things to you.Evolve or die complications.Look at that figure.It's bringing back a type of pull you can't make up.Continue to raise it up.I cannot be all these things to you. It's true.My arms hang down, my legs don't fight.
