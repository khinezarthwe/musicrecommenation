From underneath the trees, we watch the skyConfusing stars for satellitesI never dreamed that you'd be mineBut here we are, we're here tonightSinging, amen, I, I'm aliveSinging, amen, I, I'm aliveIf everyone cared and nobody criedIf everyone loved and nobody liedIf everyone shared and swallowed their prideThen we'd see the day when nobody diedI'm singin' amen, IAmen, I, I'm aliveAmen, I, amen, IAmen, I, I'm aliveAnd in the air the fire fliesOur only light in paradiseWe'll show the world they were wrongAnd teach them all to sing alongSinging, amen, I, I'm aliveSinging, amen, I, I'm aliveIf everyone cared and nobody criedIf everyone loved and nobody liedIf everyone shared and swallowed their prideThen we'd see the day when nobody diedIf everyone cared and nobody criedIf everyone loved and nobody liedIf everyone shared and swallowed their prideWe'd see the day when nobody diedWhen nobody diedAnd as we lie beneath the starsWe realize how small we areIf they could love like you and meImagine what the world could beIf everyone cared and nobody criedIf everyone loved and nobody liedIf everyone shared and swallowed their prideThen we'd see the day when nobody diedIf everyone cared and nobody criedIf everyone loved and nobody liedIf everyone shared and swallowed their prideThen we'd see the day when nobody diedWhen nobody diedWhen nobody died
