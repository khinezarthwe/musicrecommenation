Babe, oh dream about me Lie on the phone to me Tell me no truth if it is bad There's enough in my life to make me so sad Just dream about colour fills our lives Just dream about someone else tonight And babe, oh dream about me On the phone talking quietly I wanna be yours, oh won't you be mine Against red skies for all time Just dream about us when we're old Just dream about how I will let go Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Babe, oh dream about me Come on, lie on the phone to me Oh tell me no truth if it is bad There's enough in my life to make me so sad Just dream about colour fills our lives Just dream about someone else tonight Just dream about colour fills our song Just dream about how I will let go
