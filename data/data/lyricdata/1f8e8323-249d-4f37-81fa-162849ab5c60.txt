I should have listened to herSo hard to keep controlWe kept on eating but ourBloated bellies still not fullShe gave us all she had butWe went and took some moreCan't seem to shut her legs ourMother nature is a whoreI got my propaganda I got revisionismI got my violence in high def ultra-realismAll a part of this great nationI got my fist I got my plan I got survivalismHypnotic sound of sirensEchoing through the streetThe cocking of the riflesThe marching of the feetYou see your world on fireDon't try to act surprisedWe did just what you told usLost our faith along the way and found ourselves believing your liesI got my propaganda I got revisionismI got my violence in high def ultra-realismAll a part of this great nationI got my fist I got my plan I got survivalismAll bruised and broken bleedingShe asks to take my handI turn and keep on walkingWhat you'd do the same thing in the circumstance I'm sure you understandI got my propaganda I got revisionismI got my violence in high def ultra-realismAll a part of this great nationI got my fist I got my plan I got survivalism
