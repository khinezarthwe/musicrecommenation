There's a place up ahead and I'm goin'Just as fast as my feet can flyCome away, come away if you're goin'Leave the sinkin' ship behindCome on, the risin' windWe're goin' up around the bendBring a song and a smile for the banjoBetter get while the gettin's goodHitch a ride to the end of the highwayWhere the neons turn to woodCome on, the risin' windWe're goin' up around the bendYou can ponder perpetual motionFix your mind on a crystal dayAlways time for a good conversationThere's an era for what you sayCome on the risin' windWe're goin' up around the bend, yeahHitch a ride to the end of the highwayAnd we'll meet by the big red treeThere's a place up ahead and I'm goin'Come along, come along with meCome on the risin' windWe're goin' up around the bend
