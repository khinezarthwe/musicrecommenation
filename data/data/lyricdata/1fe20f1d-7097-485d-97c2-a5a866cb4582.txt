Hold on hold on, let me get the words out before I burstThere's no truth at all poking at the giant eyes of ancient godsCool heads have failed now it's time for me to have my turnKiss me kiss me, life is way too short to scream and shout.Flashed up in my wildest dreams the dark red blood streamsStretching out like vast cracked iceThe veins of you the veins of me like great forest treesPushing through and on and inGliding like a satellite in the broken nightAnd when I wake you're there I'm savedYour love is life piled tight and high set against the skyThat seems to balance on its ownSing out sing out, the silence only eats us from the inside upI meant no harm but I only get to say these words too lateWake up wake up, dreaming only leads to more and more nightmaresSnap out of it you said it in a way that showed you really cared.Flashed up in my wildest dreams the dark red blood streamsStretching out like vast cracked iceThe veins of you the veins of me like great forest treesPushing through and on and inGliding like a satellite in the broken nightAnd when I wake you're there I'm savedYour love is life piled tight and high set against the skyThat seems to balance on its ownSend your lifeboats out for meSend your lifeboat out
