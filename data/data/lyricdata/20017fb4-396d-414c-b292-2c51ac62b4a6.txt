All I do is sleep all day, and think of you A memory of the cushion life I'm clinging to The image of a mutual one, our haven The sombre chords of our song, the fading Love is no big truth Driven by our genes, we are simple selfish beings A symphony that's you Joyously awaking the ignorant and sleeping Passion and its brother hate, they come and go It could easily be made to stay for longer though Many people play this game so willingly Do I have to be like them, or be lonely? Love is no big truth Driven by our genes, we are simple selfish beings A symphony that's you Joyously awaking the ignorant and sleeping Another view Of what there is to it Getting me through it I'll never need it again, not again, not again (8x)
