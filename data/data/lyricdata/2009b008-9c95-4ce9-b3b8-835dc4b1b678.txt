Friday, friday [several times throughout the song]Your head, come on, is dead and goneIt might as well be said so longIt's suds and soda, a brain decoderAnd can I wait for my decoderGet off, get up, you son of popThe light below is bright on topIt's suds and soda, a smile decoderAnd can I get, yeah, what I ordered?And there's always something in the airSometimes suds and soda mix okay with beerCan I, can I break your sentiment?Oh, you're just reminding meCan't see no person thereJust wanna shout "What the fuck?"Jimmy ean is halloweenLike kerosene for dee dee sceneIt's suds and soda, a brain decoderAnd can I skip this thing I ordered?Get off, get up, you son of popThe light below is bright on topIt's suds and soda, a vibe decoderAnd can I get, yeah, what I ordered?There's always something in the airSometimes suds and soda mix okay with beerCan I, can I break your sentiment?Oh, you're just reminding meCan't see no person thereJust wanna shout "What the fuck?"There's always something in the airYour face, come on, is dead and goneYou might as well be said so longIt's suds and soda, a brain decoderAnd can I wait for my devoter?Get off, get up, you son of popThe light below is bright on topIt's suds and soda, a smile, decoderAnd can I skip, yeah, what I ordered?And can I break your sentiment?So can I break your sentiment?So can I break your sentiment?
