I don't get many things right the first timeIn fact, I am told that a lotNow I know all the wrong turnsThe stumbles and falls brought me hereAnd where was I before the dayThat I first saw your lovely face?Now I see it every dayAnd I knowThat I amI amI amThe luckiestWhat if I'd been born 50 years before youIn a house on the street where you live?Maybe I'd be outside as you passed on your bikeWould I know?And in a wide sea of eyesI see one pair that I recognizeAnd I knowThat I amI amI amThe luckiestI love you more than I haveEver found a way to say to youNext door there's an old man who lived to his 90sAnd one day passed away in his sleepAnd his wife, she stayed for a couple of daysAnd passed awayI'm sorry, I know that'sA strange way to tell youThat I know we belongThat I knowThat I amI amI amThe luckiest
