It started as a jokeJust one of my larks to seeIf somehow I could reach youSo I swam into your shoresThrough an open windowOnly to find you all aloneCurled up with machinesNow it seems you're slippingOut of the land of the livingJust take a closer lookTake a closer lookAt what it is that's really haunting youI have to trust you'll knowThis digital ghostBut I fear there's only so much time'Cause the you I knew is fading awayHands, lay them on my keysLet me play you againI am not immune to your netFind me there in itI won't go even if inYour heart only beats ones and oh'sSwitch you on, my friendPull you from that rip currentBut only you can fight against thisTake a closer lookJust take a closer lookAt what it is that's really haunting youI have to trust you'll knowThis digital ghostBut I fear there's only so much time'Cause the you I knew is fading awayFadingFading away
