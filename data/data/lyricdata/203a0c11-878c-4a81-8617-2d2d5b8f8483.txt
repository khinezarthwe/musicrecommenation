All is quiet on New Year's dayA world in white gets under wayAnd I want to be with you, be with you night and dayNothing changes on New Year's dayOn New Year's dayI... will be with you againI... will be with you againUnder a blood-red skyA crowd has gathered in black and whiteArms entwined, the chosen fewThe newspaper says, saysSay it's true, it's true...And we can break throughThough torn in twoWe can be oneI... I will begin againI... I will begin againOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohOh, maybe the time is rightOh, maybe tonightI will be with you againI will be with you againAnd so we are told this is the golden ageAnd gold is the reason for the wars we wageThough I want to be with youBe with you night and dayNothing changesOn New Year's DayOn New Year's DayOn New Year's Day
