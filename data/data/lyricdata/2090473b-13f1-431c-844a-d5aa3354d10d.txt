I should write a song about you and all the shit that you doYou don't even know what's upBut soon it all comes crashing down on youSince we're on the subjectTell me why your name's in the dictionary when I look up idiotCheck yourself, it's very necessaryGet up shake your rump girlCause this track is for youAnd baby this is not a love songStop listen what's that soundSupersonic spinning roundYou don't mind the fallUntil your face hits the groundCrash and burn girlGoin' down down down down downCrash and burn girlYou don't mind the fallUntil your face hits the groundYou should have a sticker on you saying Warning Keep OutYou're the kind of girl that'll mess you up for lifeThat's smashing up his carCrying on his doorstepWaiting in the rain all nightAnd did you tell him you're the kind thatNever show your ugly side until you sticking like glueShit you even go down on himThough he never do it for youTime to clear the runway for theStop listen what's that soundSupersonic spinning roundYou don't mind the fallUntil your face hits the groundIt's just that every time you mess it up like thatI see myself in youI've been there tooAnd there's so many times I stand besideAnd see what you are going throughWhere you're headed toCrash and burn girlGoin' down down down downCrash and burn girlYou don't mind the fallUntil your face hits the groundCrash and burn girlYou keep on banging your headGirl your shirt's all redCrash and burn girlYou don't mind the fallUntil your face hits the ground
