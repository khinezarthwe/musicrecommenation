While you are away, my heart comes undone;Slowly unravels, in a ball of yarn...The devil collects it, with a grin;Our love, in a ball of yarn...He'll never return it... (So when you come back, we'll have to make new love...)He'll never return it... (When you come back, we'll have to make new love...)While you are away, my heart comes undone;Slowly unravels, in a ball of yarn...The devil collects it, with a grin;Our love, our love, in a ball of yarn...He'll never return it... (When you come back, we'll have to make new love...)He'll never return it... (When you come back, we'll have to make new love...)Oh, he'll, he'll never return it... (When you come back, we'll have to make new love...)He'll never return it... (When you come back, we'll have to make new love...)
