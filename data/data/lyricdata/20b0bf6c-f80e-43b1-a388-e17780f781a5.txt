We are ready for the siegeAnd we are armed up to the teethBe careful how you live and breatheRelease what's broken underneathHow many times do you want to die?How many ways do you want to die?To feel safe again look over your shoulderVery carefully look over your shoulderWe can laugh about it nowAnd we hope everything works outBe careful how you lick your woundsBelieve the change is coming soonHow many times do you want to die?How many ways do you want to die?To feel safe again look over your shoulderVery carefully look over your shoulderYou used to do a little but a little won't flyRight before you hit your primeThat's when we fell in love but not the first timeCan it please you still?Were you named in your father's will?Or does it make you ill?Let us bruise their kneesWe will aim straight for the feetYou will be relievedSo relieved, so relievedTurn on full desireFeel the sparks of the friendly fireMisery inspiresYour throat has been cut several timesBeforeNever noticed the size of the flowMake it be ignoredTo feel safe again look over your shoulderCarefully look over your shoulderYou said you believed it but believing won't flyAnd right before you hit your primeThat's when we fell in love but not the first timeAnd when it's all over and you open your eyesTo see the room turned on its sideYou'll be lying by a note on the floor signed:The royal weThe royal weThe royal weThe royal weThe royal weThe royal weThe royal weThe royal weLove, the royal we
