You waitWanting this world to let you inAnd you stand thereA frozen lightIn dark and empty streetsAnd you smileHiding behind a God-given faceAnd I know you're so much moreEverything they ignoreIs all that I need to seeAnd you're the only one I ever believed inThe answer that could never be foundThe moment you decided to let love inAnd now I'm banging on the door of an angelThe end of fear is where we beginThe moment we decided to let love inI wishWishing for you to find your wayAnd I'll hold on for all you needThat's all we need to sayI'll take my chances whileYou take your time withThis game you playBut I can't control your soulYou need to let me knowYou leaving or you gonna stayAnd you're the only one I ever believed inThe answer that could never be foundThe moment you decided to let love inNow I'm banging on the door of an angelThe end of fear is where we beginThe moment we decided to let love inThere's nothing we can do aboutThe things we have to do withoutThe only way to feel againIs let love inThere's nothing we can do aboutThe things we have to live withoutThe only way to see againIs let love inYou're the only one I ever believed inThe answer that could never be foundThe moment you decided to let love inNow I'm banging on the door of an angelThe end of fear is where we beginThe moment we decided to let love in
