Here you come againJust when I've begun to get myself togetherYou waltz right in the doorJust like you've done beforeAnd wrap my heart 'round your little fingerHere you come againJust when I'm about to make it work without youYou look into my eyesAnd lie those pretty liesAnd pretty soon I'm wonderin' how I came to doubt youAll you got to do is smile that smileAnd there go all my defensesJust leave it up to you and in a little whileYou're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my sensesHere you come againLookin' better than a body has a right toAnd shakin' me up soThat all I really knowIs here you come againAnd here I goAll you got to do is smile that smileAnd there go all my defensesJust leave it up to you and in a little whileYou're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my sensesHere you come againLookin' better than a body has a right toAnd shakin' me up soThat all I really knowIs here you come againAnd here I goHere I goAnd here I goAnd here I goHere you come againAnd here I goHere I goAnd here I goHere I go
