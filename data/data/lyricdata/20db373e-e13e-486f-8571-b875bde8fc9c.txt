How does it feelTo treat me like you doWhen you've laid your hands upon meAnd told me who you are?I thought I was mistakenI thought I heard your wordsTell me, how do I feel?Tell me now, how do I feel?Those who came before meLived through their vocationsFrom the past until completionThey'll turn away no moreAnd I still find it so hardTo say what I need to sayBut I'm quite sure that you'll tell meJust how I should feel todayI see a ship in the harbourI can and shall obeyBut if it wasn't for your misfortuneI'd be a heavenly person todayAnd I thought I was mistakenAnd I thought I heard you speakTell me, how do I feel?Tell me now, how should I feel?Now, I stand here waitingI thought I told you to leave meWhile I walked down to the beachTell me, how does it feelWhen your heart grows cold?
