When you came to me with your bad dreams and your fearsIt was easy to see that you'd been cryingSeems like everywhere you turn catastrophe it reignsBut who really profits from the dyingI could hold you in my armsI could hold you foreverI could hold you in my armsI could hold you foreverWhen you kissed my lips with my mouth so full of questionsIt's my worried mind that you quietPlace your hands on my faceClose my eyes and sayLove is a poor man's foodDon't prophesizeI could hold you in my armsI could hold you foreverAnd I could hold you in my armsI could hold you foreverSo now we see how it isThis fist begets the spearWeapons of warSymptoms of madnessDon't let your eyes refuse to seeDon't let your ears refuse to hearOr you ain't never going to shake this sense of sadnessI could hold you in my armsI could hold on foreverAnd I could hold you in my armsI could hold forever
