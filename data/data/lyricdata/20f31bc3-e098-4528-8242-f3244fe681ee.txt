I dream of the winter in my heart turning to springWhile the ice gives way under my feetAnd so I drown with the sunI've been burning in water and drowning in flameTo prove you wrong and scare you awayI admit my defeat and want back homeIn your heart under the roseI open my eyes with a sigh of reliefAs the warmth of summer's sunlight dances around meAnd I see you with dead leaves in your handsI've been burning in water and drowning in flameTo prove you wrong and scare you awayI admit my defeat and want back homeIn your heart under the roseYour heart under the rose
