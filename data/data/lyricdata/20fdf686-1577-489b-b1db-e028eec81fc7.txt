Well the key to my survivalWas never in much doubtThe question was how I could keep saneTrying to find the way outThings were never easy for mePeace of mind was hard to findAnd I needed a place where I could hideSomewhere I could call mineI didn't think much about itTill it started happening all the timeSoon I was living with the fear every dayOf what might happen that nightI couldn't stand to hear the cryingOf my mother, and I remember whenI swore that, that would be the last they'd see of meAnd I never went home againThey say that time is a healerAnd now my wounds are not the sameI rang the bell with my heart in my mouthI had to hear what he'd sayWell, he sat me down to talk to meHe looked me straight in the eyesHe said, you're no son, you're no son of mineYou're no son, you're no son of mineYou walked out, you left us behindAnd you're no son, you're no son of mineOh, his words how they hurt, I'll never forget itAnd as the time, it went by, I lived to regret itYou're no son, you're no son of mineBut where should I go, and what should I doYou're no son, you're no son of mineBut I came here for help, oh I came here for youWell the years, they passed so slowlyI thought about him every dayWhat would I do if we passed on the street?Would I keep running away?In and out of hiding placesSoon I'd have to face the factsWe'd have to sit down and talk it overAnd that would mean going backThey say that time is a healerAnd now my wounds are not the sameBut I rang the bell with my heart in my mouthI had to hear what he'd sayHe sat me down to talk to meAnd he looked me straight in the eyesHe said, you're no son, you're no son of mineYou're no son, you're no son of mineWhen you walked out, you left us behindAnd you're no son, you're no son of mineOh, his words how they hurt, I'll never forget itAnd as the time, it went by, I lived to regret itYou're no son, you're no son of mineBut where should I go, and what should I doYou're no son, you're no son of mineBut I came here for help, oh I was looking for youYou're no son, you're no son of mine, ohYou're no son, ha yeah, ha yeah, ha yeahYou're no son, you're no son of mine, oh, oh
