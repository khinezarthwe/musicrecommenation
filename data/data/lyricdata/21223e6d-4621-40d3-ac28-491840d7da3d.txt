Starting now the wait is overAs long as you jump the ride'Cause I won't highway-walk foreverAs long as you jump the rideAs long as you follow meThis is what I do, like I doI've been on the ride beforeIt never stops at allIt never stops at allYou'll start your engines like a virginAs long as you jump the rideWe'll cut the whip and lose the anchorAs long as you jump the rideAs long as you follow meThis is what I do, like I doI've been on the ride beforeIt never stops at allIt never stops at allAs long as you follow meThis is what I do, like I doI've been on the ride beforeIt never stops at allIt never stops at allDon't you feel for us?That we're on the round and round?Don't you hear the endless motor sound?As long as you follow meThis is what I do, like I doI've been on the ride beforeIt never stops at allNever stops at allNever stops at all
