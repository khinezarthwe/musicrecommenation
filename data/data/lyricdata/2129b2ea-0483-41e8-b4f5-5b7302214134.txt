Early in the morning clouds are dropping on my head Remind me the things last night I should have left unsaid So please forgive the words I use, my mind it tends to run Away with the small ideas, I know I'm not the only one So dear, oh dear My head it tends to stray away sometimes I cant see clear Oh dear, oh dear In spite of all the things I said, I always want you near Sometimes it rains, sometimes it pours Sometimes I'm not that sure But anytime you look at me Your thoughts I cant ignore The second hand would pass us by Should one of us had blinked But in a minute realize that true love always waits My dear, oh dear My head it tends to stray away, sometimes I cant see clear Oh dear, oh dear In spite of all the things I said, I always want you near Early in the morning clouds are dropping on my head Remind me the things last night I should have left unsaid So please forgive the words I use my mind it tends to run Away with the small ideas I know I'm not the only one
