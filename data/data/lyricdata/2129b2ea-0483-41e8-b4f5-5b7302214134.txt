Early in the morning clouds are dropping on my headRemind me the things last night I should have left unsaidSo please forgive the words I use, my mind it tends to runAway with the small ideas, I know I'm not the only oneSo dear, oh dearMy head it tends to stray away sometimes I cant see clearOh dear, oh dearIn spite of all the things I said, I always want you nearSometimes it rains, sometimes it poursSometimes I'm not that sureBut anytime you look at meYour thoughts I cant ignoreThe second hand would pass us byShould one of us had blinkedBut in a minute realize that true love always waitsMy dear, oh dearMy head it tends to stray away, sometimes I cant see clearOh dear, oh dearIn spite of all the things I said, I always want you nearEarly in the morning clouds are dropping on my headRemind me the things last night I should have left unsaidSo please forgive the words I use my mind it tends to runAway with the small ideas I know I'm not the only one
