I sold my soul so I could try I'm standing at the picket line And anyone that wants the fun now is the time I'm calling out to you from the basement I got a need to feel so I Shake! Shake! You got a problem with me, say it I couldn't care if we lose, no She said I'm lost and out of love I think it's more a case of no damn luck Just like a gun just for the fun I set it off I'm calling out to you from the basement I got a need to feel so I Shake! Shake! You got a problem with me, say it I couldn't care if we lose I'm calling out to you from the basement I got a need to feel so I Shake! Shake! You got a problem with me, say it I couldn't care if we lose, no Another poem to you from the bedroom Into the streets I run from the classroom I got a need to feel so I Shake! Shake! I got a need to feel so I Shake! Shake!
