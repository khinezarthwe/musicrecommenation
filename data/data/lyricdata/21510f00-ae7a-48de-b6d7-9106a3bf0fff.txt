I sold my soul so I could tryI'm standing at the picket lineAnd anyone that wants the fun now is the timeI'm calling out to you from the basementI got a need to feel so I Shake! Shake!You got a problem with me, say itI couldn't care if we lose, noShe said I'm lost and out of loveI think it's more a case of no damn luckJust like a gun just for the fun I set it offI'm calling out to you from the basementI got a need to feel so I Shake! Shake!You got a problem with me, say itI couldn't care if we loseI'm calling out to you from the basementI got a need to feel so I Shake! Shake!You got a problem with me, say itI couldn't care if we lose, noAnother poem to you from the bedroomInto the streets I run from the classroomI got a need to feel so I Shake! Shake!I got a need to feel so I Shake! Shake!
