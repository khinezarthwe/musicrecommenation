The world beat you for the something nice You worked hard, died poor You mined what you died for Diamonds di di di di di uh You can whistle my name It's the mines, in Africa That are to blame You can Scoop out my brain Shape it into an ear and then tell me your pain I've been awake from the first day Stayed awake, stayed awake The rabbit was removed under the whole moon Long bird, short road Dig deep but don't dig too deep When it's late you'll see the hole is empty and oh so deadly They want me raw but smooth like glass They want it fast but they don't want flaws I'm a girl's best friend Can you cut, I can cut, 'cause I'm a rough gem Who lives in those lights in the distance? Watered down, the rain will help you out I had a dream, it was all a dream But it was ruined by the sun shining through me
