The world beat you for the something niceYou worked hard, died poorYou mined what you died forDiamonds di di di di di uhYou can whistle my nameIt's the mines, in AfricaThat are to blameYou can Scoop out my brainShape it into an ear and then tell me your painI've been awake from the first dayStayed awake, stayed awakeThe rabbit was removed under the whole moonLong bird, short roadDig deep but don't dig too deepWhen it's late you'll see the hole is empty and oh so deadlyThey want me raw but smooth like glassThey want it fast but they don't want flawsI'm a girl's best friendCan you cut, I can cut, 'cause I'm a rough gemWho lives in those lights in the distance?Watered down, the rain will help you outI had a dream, it was all a dreamBut it was ruined by the sun shining through me
