All I want from you is everythingI ever wanted for just one nightAnd all I care for is for youTo leave me aloneWhen the morn comesTake everything we had away from youAnd you away from meI can't keep youI can't hold you tightI can't lull you to sleepDespite my hurtful waysI can still make you blushTremble lips speakSound screamsLover's deathIt's time you leaveAnd all I want from you is all I tookI can't keep youI can't hold you tightI can't lull you to sleepDespite my hurtful waysI can still make you blushI can't keep youI can't hold you tightI can't lull you to sleepDespite my hurtful waysI can still make you blush
