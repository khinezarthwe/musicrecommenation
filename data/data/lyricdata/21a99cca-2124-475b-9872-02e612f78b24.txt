Last night I told a stranger all about youThey smiled patiently with disbeliefI always knew you would succeedNo matter what you triedAnd I know you did it allIn spite of meStill I'm proud to have known youFor the short time that I didProud to have been a step up on your wayProud to be a part of your illustrious careerAnd I know you did it allIn spite of meIn spite of meLate last night I saw you in my living roomYou seemed so close but yet so coolFor a long time I thought that you'd be coming back to meThose kind of thoughts can be so cruelSo cruelAnd I know you did it allIn spite of meIn spite of me
