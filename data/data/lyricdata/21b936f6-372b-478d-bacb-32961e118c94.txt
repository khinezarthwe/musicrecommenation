You in the water, Underneath the tarpIt don't rain under the waterIt don't rain inside my heartDon't follow me homeDon't follow me homeYou walking in the gulf streamTail between your legsIt's not funny if you ask meIt's just funny in your headHang on Hang on Hang onHang on Hang on Hang onMy tongue is filled with sugarAnd my back is filled with painYour tongue is on my shoulderAnd there's nothing on my brainDon't follow me homeDon't follow me homeShake barrels of whiskey down my throatI'll still see straight Ride out on a ponyEven loose I won't be lateHang on Hang on Hang onHang on Hang on Hang onI'll ride on a pony till I'm dusty and I'm oldMy head is filled with flowersAnd I'm dressed in shiny goldI'm dressed in shiny goldKeep an eye on me I shimmer on horizonsI shimmer on horizons A shimmer on horizonsA shimmer in your eyes son A shimmer in your eye
