You in the water, Underneath the tarp It don't rain under the water It don't rain inside my heart Don't follow me home Don't follow me home You walking in the gulf stream Tail between your legs It's not funny if you ask me It's just funny in your head Hang on Hang on Hang on Hang on Hang on Hang on My tongue is filled with sugar And my back is filled with pain Your tongue is on my shoulder And there's nothing on my brain Don't follow me home Don't follow me home Shake barrels of whiskey down my throat I'll still see straight Ride out on a pony Even loose I won't be late Hang on Hang on Hang on Hang on Hang on Hang on I'll ride on a pony till I'm dusty and I'm old My head is filled with flowers And I'm dressed in shiny gold I'm dressed in shiny gold Keep an eye on me I shimmer on horizons I shimmer on horizons A shimmer on horizons A shimmer in your eyes son A shimmer in your eye
