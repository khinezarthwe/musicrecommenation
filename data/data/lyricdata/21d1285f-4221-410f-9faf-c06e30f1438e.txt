Still a little bit of your taste in my mouthStill a little bit of you laced with my doubtStill a little hard to say what's going onThere's still a little bit of your ghost, your witnessStill a little bit of your face I haven't kissedYou step a little closer each dayThat I can't say what's going onStones taught me to flyLove, it taught me to lieLife, it taught me to dieSo it's not hard to fallWhen you float like a cannonballThere's still a little bit of your song in my earThere's still a little bit of your words I long to hearYou step a little closer to meSo close that I can't see what's going onStones taught me to flyLove, it taught me to lieLife taught me to dieSo it's not hard to fallWhen you float like a cannonStones taught me to flyLove, it taught me to crySo come on courage, teach me to be shy'Cause it's not hard to fallAnd I don't want to scare herIt's not hard to fallAnd I don't wanna loseIt's not hard to growWhen you know that you just don't know
