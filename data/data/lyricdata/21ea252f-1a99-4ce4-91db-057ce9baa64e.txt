I was down in AmsterdamAlmost hurt myself to deathI pushed myself so hard just like the redlight girlsWell I cried and stopped to smileI thought my career is overAnd the dealer boys they had to bring me waterI stumbled over mountainsAnd the shadows of the streetI fell into the riverI cried and begged for mercyAnd I talked to God on the telephoneBut I really can't tell you what he told meBut it was a lieNo I really can't tell you what he told meBut it was a lieWhen I came to in AmsterdamThe hotel showed a movieWith Marlon Brando and his friend PacinoWell I thought that this is niceAnd I'm sure I can relax nowBut suddenly the room was full of demonsI escaped through the windowAlmost ran a mile awayI had nowhere to goSo I cried and begged for mercyAnd I talked to God on the telephoneBut I really can't tell you what he told meBut it was a lieNo I really can't tell you what he told meBut it was a lieBut nothing seems to matterIn this lonesome dirty townBut for a short brief momentI thought she was the oneAnd she and I were fightingAbout sex, love and TVThat's why I had to get downAnd talk to God on the telephoneBut I really can't tell you what he told meBut it was a lieNo I really can't tell you what he told meBut it was a lie
