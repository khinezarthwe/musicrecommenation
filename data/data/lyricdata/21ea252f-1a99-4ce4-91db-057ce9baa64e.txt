I was down in Amsterdam Almost hurt myself to death I pushed myself so hard just like the redlight girls Well I cried and stopped to smile I thought my career is over And the dealer boys they had to bring me water I stumbled over mountains And the shadows of the street I fell into the river I cried and begged for mercy And I talked to God on the telephone But I really can't tell you what he told me But it was a lie No I really can't tell you what he told me But it was a lie When I came to in Amsterdam The hotel showed a movie With Marlon Brando and his friend Pacino Well I thought that this is nice And I'm sure I can relax now But suddenly the room was full of demons I escaped through the window Almost ran a mile away I had nowhere to go So I cried and begged for mercy And I talked to God on the telephone But I really can't tell you what he told me But it was a lie No I really can't tell you what he told me But it was a lie But nothing seems to matter In this lonesome dirty town But for a short brief moment I thought she was the one And she and I were fighting About sex, love and T V That's why I had to get down And talk to God on the telephone But I really can't tell you what he told me But it was a lie No I really can't tell you what he told me But it was a lie
