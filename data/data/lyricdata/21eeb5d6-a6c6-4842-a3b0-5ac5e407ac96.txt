Who'd ever thought that i would see this day.... Where i would see my ghetto life fade away... Cos i was lost and couldn't find a way...and now i look forward to every day....(welcome to my sunny day)... Block dont stop always stayed hot... No matter how the seasons got.. I still remember when they took me away.... Kept it on lock den i got cuaght den i realised dat i had to stop... Den i took the time to explore a better way... Searched high and low, so close, yet so far to go...i just know, theres a sunny day Who'd ever thought that i would see this day.... Where i would see my ghetto life fade away... Cos i was lost and couldn't find a way...and now i look forward to every day.... Welcome to my sunny day...my sunny day...everyday....a better day... Welcome to my sunny day...my sunny day....every day...a better day...welcome to my sunny day... Been a long day...on my way to my holy place to pray... Give thanks for every blessing given to me... I know theres more to see...more to me...no more living in misery... Cos this is how i visioned life to beee..... Searched high and low, so close, yet so far to go...i just know, theres a sunny day Who'd ever thought that i would see this day.... Where i would see my ghetto life fade away... Cos i was lost and couldn't find a way...and now i look forward to every day.... Welcome to my sunny day...my sunny day...everyday....a better day... Welcome to my sunny day...my sunny day....every day...a better day...welcome to my sunny day...
