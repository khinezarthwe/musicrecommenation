The seals, they cried in jubileeSharks, they howled along with meAnd birds, they flew into the windThe whale, he roamed the lonely seaAnd I dive into youI dive into youAnd, oh, this ocean blue'Cause I dive into youLighthouse dog lifted his browThe crippled trees bent low to growlAnd swans, they wrestled with lifetime's graspIn hopefulness they nestled the pastTeachers and travelers made their markThey dined and feasted on whale and sharkAnd, so, the ocean lost its depthsAnd boredom rained as the ocean weptBirds they raised their young for deadAnd ladies used feathery pillows for bedAnd black snow came and black snow stayedAnd froze the ocean out of loveOut of loveI lay quiet, next to youTransformed a whole, transformed anewNo longer diving intoBut lying quiet next to you
