Far awayIn some lovely way I hear your callWhatever happened to them all?Whatever happened to us all?I know that we've never met beforeBut that was then, and now I need you moreIs someone here keeping the score?Is there only dying at your door?Taking me down off this crossLay me down, down, down in the dustWhoa, love, take my hand across the crowdI have been digging undergroundWhat'er remains is yet to be foundI have no childrenI have no husbandI have no reasonTo be aliveOh, give me oneGreen grass blades are all on fireI own the crack that's in the windFrom your window I see bars and the birdsThey sing and they sing and they sing and they singAnd the dogsThey bark and they bark and they bark and they bark and they barkAh...Whatever happened to them all?Whatever happened to us all?Annie had two young baby boysAnd Jimi went crazy, crazy, crazy late last FallAh...
