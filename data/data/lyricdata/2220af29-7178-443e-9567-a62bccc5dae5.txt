The unknown distance to the great beyondStares back at my grieving frameTo cast my shadow by the holy sunMy spirit moans, with a sacred painIt's quiet nowThe universe is standing stillAnd there's nothin' I can sayThere's nothin' we can do nowThere's nothin' I can sayThere's nothin' we can do nowAnd all that stands between the soul's releaseThis temporary flesh and boneI know that it's over nowI feel my faded mind begin to roamEvery time you fought and, every time you triedEvery foolish dream and, every compromiseEvery word you spoke and, everything you saidEverything you left me, rambles in my headAnd there's nothing I can sayThere's nothing I can do nowThere's nothing I can sayThere's nothing I can do nowUp above the, world so highEverything you loved and, every time you triedEverybody's watchin', everybody cryStay don't leave me, the stars can wait for your signDon't signal nowAnd there's nothing I can sayThere's nothing I can do nowThere's nothing I can sayThere's nothing we can do nowGoodnightTravel wellGoodnightTravel wellAnd there's nothing I can sayNothing I can do nowGo travel wellTravel well
