No woman, no cry No woman, no cry No woman, no cry No woman, no cry Say, say Say I remember when we used to sit In a government yard in Trenchtown Observing the hypocrites As they would mingle with the good people we meet Good friends we have Oh, good friends we lost along the way In this great future You can't forget your past So dry your tears, I say No woman, no cry No woman, no cry Little darling, don't shed no tears No woman, no cry Say, say Said I remember when we use to sit In the government yard in Trenchtown And then Georgie would make the fire lights I seh, log would burnin' through the nights Then we would cook cornmeal porridge Of which I'll share with you My feet is my only carriage And so I've got to push on through Oh, while I'm gone Everything 's gonna be alright Everything 's gonna be alright No woman, no cry No woman, no cry I say little darlin' Don't shed no tears No woman, no cry
