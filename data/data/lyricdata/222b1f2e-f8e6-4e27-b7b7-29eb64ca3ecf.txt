First time the longing in you wears the girl that grows itAnd if he relieves you know that then you've blown itAnd as life goes on you know you get to tasteAll you findCause baby, you're my lightBaby you're my lightNext time the feeling is the same, don't have to show itA window of belief is where you own itAnd as life goes on you know you have to faceAll you findCause baby, you're my lightBaby, you're my lightBaby, you're my lightBaby, you're my lightLast time the years have gone the moment's on you know itBut I believe in you and now I'll show itAnd as life goes on you know you don't have to hateAll you findBaby, you're my light [Repeat: x5]
