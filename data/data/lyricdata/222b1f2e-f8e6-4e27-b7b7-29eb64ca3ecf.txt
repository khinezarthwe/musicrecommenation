First time the longing in you wears the girl that grows it And if he relieves you know that then you've blown it And as life goes on you know you get to taste All you find Cause baby, you're my light Baby you're my light Next time the feeling is the same, don't have to show it A window of belief is where you own it And as life goes on you know you have to face All you find Cause baby, you're my light Baby, you're my light Baby, you're my light Baby, you're my light Last time the years have gone the moment's on you know it But I believe in you and now I'll show it And as life goes on you know you don't have to hate All you find Baby, you're my light [ Repeat: x5]
