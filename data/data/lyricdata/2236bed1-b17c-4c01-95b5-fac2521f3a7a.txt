Realized I can never win Sometimes, I feel like I have failed Inside, where do I begin? My mind is laughing at me Tell me, why am I to blame? Aren't we supposed to be the same? That's why I will never tame this thing that's burning in me I am the one who chose my path, I am the one who couldn't last I feel the life pulled from me, I feel the anger changing me Sometimes, I can never tell if I've got something after me That's why I just beg and plead for this curse to leave me Tell me why am I to blame? Aren't we supposed to be the same? That's why I will never tame this thing that's burning in me I am the one who chose my path, I am the one who couldn't last I feel the life pulled from me( It's burning in me) I feel the anger changing me Betrayed, I feel so enslaved I really tried, I did my time I did my time, I did my time, I did my time, I did my time I am the one who chose my path, I am the one who couldn't last I feel the life pulled from me( It's burning in me) I feel the anger changing me Oh, God, the anger's changing me Oh, God, the anger's changing me
