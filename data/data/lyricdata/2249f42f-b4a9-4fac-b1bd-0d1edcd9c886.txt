A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell No rhyme or reason or time of the season, but oh well The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul You know what to cover, I think for another it's a story told So get a good hold, yeah Regiment fooled you, you thought that you knew who you are A simple equation, that's the relation, but that's gone too far A time of suspicion, a special condition that we all know So let it all go, yeah Turn up the night Turn up the night Turn up the night, it feels so right Nighttime sorrow, taken like the pain Black will not be colour, why, it's all the same Evil lurks in twilight, dances in the dark Makes you need the movement like a fire needs a spark to burn A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell No rhyme or reason or time of the season, but oh well The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul So get a good hold, yeah Turn up the night Turn up the night Turn up the night, it feels so right Got to turn up the night Turn up the night Turn up the night, it feels so right Turn up the night Turn up the night Get out the light Turn up the night If it feels right Turn up the light But if it feels right Shut out the light Turn up the night Turn up the night
