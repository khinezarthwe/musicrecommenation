Finished with my woman'Cause she couldn't help me with my mindPeople think I'm insaneBecause I am frowning all the timeAll day long I think of thingsBut nothing seems to satisfyThink I'll lose my mindIf I don't find something to pacifyCan you help me occupy my brain?Oh yeahI need someone to show meThe things in life that I can't findI can't see the things that make true happinessI must be blindMake a joke and I will sighAnd you will laugh and I will cryHappiness I cannot feelAnd love to me is so unrealAnd so as you hear these wordsTelling you now of my stateI tell you to enjoy lifeI wish I could but it's too late
