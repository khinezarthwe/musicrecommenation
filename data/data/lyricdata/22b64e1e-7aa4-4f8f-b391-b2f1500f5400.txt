If I should fall from grace with GodWhere no doctor can relieve meIf I'm buried 'neath the sodBut the angels won't receive meLet me go, boysLet me go, boysLet me go down in the mudWhere the rivers all run dryThis land was always oursWas the proud land of our fathersIt belongs to us and themNot to any of the othersLet them go, boysLet them go, boysLet them go down in the mudWhere the rivers all run dryBury me at seaWhere no murdered ghost can haunt meIf I rock upon the wavesThen no corpse can lie upon meIt's coming up three, boysKeeps coming up three, boysLet them go down in the mudWhere the rivers all run dryIf I should fall from grace with GodWhere no doctor can relieve meIf I'm buried 'neath the sodStill the angels won't receive meLet me go, boysLet me go, boysLet me go down in the mudWhere the rivers all run dry
