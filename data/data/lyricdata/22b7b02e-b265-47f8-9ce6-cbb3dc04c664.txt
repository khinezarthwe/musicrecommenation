Feel no pain, but my life ain't easyI know I'm my best friendNo one cares, but I'm so much strongerI'll fight until the endTo escape from the true false worldUndamaged destinyCan't get caught in the endless circleRing of stupidityOut for my own, out to be freeOne with my mind, they just can't seeNo need to hear things that they sayLife is for my own to live my own wayRape my mind and destroy my feelingsDon't tell me what to doI don't care now 'cause I'm on my sideAnd I can see through youFeed my brain with your so called standardsWho says that I ain't rightBreak away from your common fashionSee through your blurry sightOut for my own, out to be freeOne with my mind, they just can't seeNo need to hear things that they sayLife is for my own to live my own waySee them try to bring the hammer downNo damn chains can hold me to the groundLife is for my own to live my own wayLife is for my own to live my own wayLife is for my own to live my own wayLife is for my own to live my own wayLife is for my own to live my own wayLife is for my own to live my own wayLife is for my own to live my own way
