On the corner of Main StreetJust tryin' to keep it in lineYou say you wanna move on andYou say I'm falling behindCan you read my mindCan you read my mindI never really gave up onBreakin' out of this two-star townI got the green light, I got a little fightI'm gonna turn this thing aroundCan you read my mindCan you read my mindThe good old days, the honest manThe restless heart, the Promised LandA subtle kiss that no one seesA broken wrist and a big trapezeOh, well, I don't mind if you don't mind'Cause I don't shine if you don't shineBefore you jumpCan you read my mindIt's funny how you just break downWaitin' on some signI pull up to the front of your drivewayWith magic soakin' my spineCan you read my mindCan you read my mindTeenage queen, the loaded gunThe drop-dead dream, the Chosen OneA Southern drawl, a world unseenA city wall and a trampolineOh, well, I don't mind, if you don't mind'Cause I don't shine if you don't shineBefore you jumpTell me what you findCan you read my mindSlippin' in my faith until I fallYou never returned that callWoman, open the door, don't let it stingI wanna breathe that fire againShe said, "I don't mind, if you don't mind'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine."Put your back on meOh, put your back on meOh, put your back on meThe stars are blazing like rebel diamonds cut out of the sunCan you read my mindUh-huh
