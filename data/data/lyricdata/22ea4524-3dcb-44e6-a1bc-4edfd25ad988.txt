I thought I saw a man brought to lifeHe was warm, he came around and he was dignifiedHe showed me what it was to cryWell, you couldn't be that man I adoredYou don't seem to know, seem to care what your heart is forBut I don't know him anymoreThere's nothing where he used to lieThe conversation has run dryThat's what's goin' onNothing's fine, I'm tornI'm all out of faithThis is how I feelI'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floorIllusion never changedInto something realI'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is tornYou're a little lateI'm already tornSo I guess the fortune teller's rightShould have seen just what was there and not some holy lightBut you crawled beneath my veins and nowI don't care, I have no luckI don't miss it all that muchThere's just so many thingsThat I can't touch, I'm tornI'm all out of faithThis is how I feelI'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floorIllusion never changedInto something realI'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is tornYou're a little lateI'm already tornTornThere's nothing where he used to lieMy inspiration has run dryThat's what's goin' onNothing's right, I'm tornI'm all out of faithThis is how I feelI'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floorIllusion never changedInto something realI'm wide awake and I can see the perfect sky is tornI'm all out of faithThis is how I feelI'm cold and I'm ashamed, bound and broken on the floorYou're a little lateI'm already tornTorn(Oh yeah, a little)(Oh yeah, a little)(Oh yeah, a little)
