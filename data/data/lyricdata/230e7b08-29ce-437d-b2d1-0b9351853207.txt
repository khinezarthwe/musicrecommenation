My child arrived just the other dayCame to the world in the usual wayBut there were planes to catch, and bills to payHe learned to walk while I was awayHe was talkin' 'fore I knew itAnd as he grew, he said"I'm gonna be like you, DadYou know, I'm gonna be like you"And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoonLittle boy blue and the man on the moon"When you comin' home?" "Son, I don't know whenWe'll get together thenYou know we'll have a good time then"Well, my son turned ten just the other dayHe said, "Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's playCould you teach me to throw?" I said, "Not todayI got a lot to do." He said, "That's okay"And he walked awayAnd he smiled and he said"You know, I'm gonna be like him, yeahYou know I'm gonna be like him"And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoonLittle boy blue and the man on the moon"When you comin' home?" "Son, I don't know whenWe'll get together thenYou know we'll have a good time then"Well, he came from college just the other daySo much like a man I just had to say"I'm proud of youCould you sit for a while?"He shook his head, and he said with a smile"What I'd really like, DadIs to borrow the car keysSee you later. Can I have them please?"And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoonLittle boy blue and the man on the moon"When you comin' home?" "Son, I don't know whenWe'll get together thenYou know we'll have a good time then"I've long since retired, my son's moved awayI called him up just the other day"I'd like to see you, if you don't mindHe said, "I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time""You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the fluBut it's sure nice talkin' to you, DadIt's been sure nice talkin' to you"And as I hung up the phone it occurred to meHe'd grown up just like meMy boy was just like meAnd the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoonLittle boy blue and the man on the moon"When you comin' home?" "Son, I don't know whenWe'll get together thenYou know we'll have a good time then"And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoonLittle boy blue and the man on the moon"When you comin' home?" "Son, I don't know whenWe'll get together thenYou know we'll have a good time then"
