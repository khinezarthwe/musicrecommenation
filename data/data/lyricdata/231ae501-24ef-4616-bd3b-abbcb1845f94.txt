This a page from my diaryThe fifteen day of NovemberThis a page from my diaryWhat happened that dayI don't rememberBut I do remember whenI wrote these words and thenAnd then reread themSlowly to myselfWithout emotionAnd although the feelings changedThe words still sound the sameO PamelaTell everyoneHang my head in shameTake your name in vainO PamelaO PamelaI have no soulI'm as cold as DecemberMaybe twice as coldAnd I'm as white as the snowBecause of my ageBut my hand was shakingAs I wrote this pageAnd although the feelings changedThe words still sound the sameO PamelaTell everyoneHang my head in shameTake your name in vainO PamelaO Pamela you have everythingEverything you bargained forEverything you worked forEverything you would have killed forTake everythingOpen the doorI'll let the rain pour inAnd first thing in the morningThe telephone ringsPamela says'Oh look at the time'Believe me, that's the last thing on my mindWill you take a walk with me in the sunshineO Pamela, before it's too lateWill you take a walk with me by the oceanO Pamela, before it's too late
