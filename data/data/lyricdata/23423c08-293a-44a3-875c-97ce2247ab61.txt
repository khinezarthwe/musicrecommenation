Flash that buttery gold, jittery zeitgeistWither by the watering hole, what a patrolWhat are we, to heart huckabee, art fuckery suddenly?Not enough young in his lung for the water wingColorfully vulgar poacher at a mulch like'Imma pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt.' (Fine)Sign of the time we elapsedWhen a primate climb up the spine and attachEye for an eye, by the bog's life swamps and vinesThey get a rise out of frogs and fliesSo when a dog fights hog-tied prize sorta costs a lifeThe mouths water on a fork and knifeAnd the allure isn't rightNo score on a war-torn beachWhere the cash cows actually beefBlood turns wine when I leak for policeLike 'That's not a riot, it's a feast, let's eat.'And I will remember your name and faceOn the day you were judged by the funhouse casteAnd I will rejoice in your fall from graceWith a cane to the sky like 'None shall pass.'None shall pass, none shall passNow if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fixyou wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitzHow he spoke through a no-doze, motor on the fritz'Cause he wouldn't play roll over, fetch, like a bitchAnd express no regrets though he isn't worth the homeowners pissTo the jokers who pose by the glitz (Fine)Sign of the swine and the swarmWhen a king is a whore who comply and conformMiles outside of the eye of the stormWith a siphon to lure and a prize and awardWhile avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and warTrue blue triumph is moreLike wait, let it snake up outta the centerfoldLet it break the walls of Jericho. Ready? Go.Sat where the old cardboard city folksSwap tails with heads like every other penny throwAnd I will remember your name and faceOn the day you were judged by the funhouse casteAnd I will rejoice in your fall from graceWith a cane to the sky like 'None shall pass.'None shall pass, none shall passOkay, woke to a grocery listGoes like this: duty and deathAnyone object, come stand in the wayYou can be my little Snake River Canyon todayAnd I ran with a chain of commandsAnd a jetpack strap where the backstab lands if it can. (Fine)Sign of the vibe in the crowdWhen I cut a belly open to find what climb outWhat a bit of gusto he muster upTo make a dark horse rush like enough's enoughIt must'a struck a nerve so they huff and puffTill all the king's men fluster and clusterfuckAnd it's a beautiful thingTo my people who keep an impressive wing spanEven when the cubicle shrinkYou gotta pull up the intruder by the root of the weedNY chew thru the machineAnd I will remember your name and faceOn the day you were judged by the funhouse castAnd I will rejoice in your fall from graceWith a cane to the sky like 'None shall pass.'None shall pass, none shall pass
