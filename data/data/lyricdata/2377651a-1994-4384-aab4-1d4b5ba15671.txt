The finches and sparrows build nests in my chimneyWith remains of the small flightless birds that you failed to protectBut the yolk isn't easy in fact it's a dragAs they're blowin' through cornfields and mountains of ragsAll over the suburbs across the great lawnsAnd they're cropdusting gardens all over this townBut nobody cares when it gets in their hairIt gets in their lungs as it floats through the airIt gets in the food that they buy and prepareBut nobody cares when it gets in their hairAcross the great chasms and schismsAnd the sudden aneurysmsWhere the black ink will drip across the cuspis of your eyesAnd your teeth, they're worth more than you can spareOh, don't tell me that it just isn't fairDon't speak about the cycles of life'Cause your thoughts are so soft I can cut 'em with a spork, or a bride's knifeAnd the wine made our mouths too looseSuch a reckless choice of wordsWhen you told me that I'm too abstruseI just thought it was a kind of birdI swear, I just stood thereNot saying a word
