You ask me if I love youAnd I choke on my replyI'd rather hurt you honestlyThan mislead you with a lieAnd who am I to judge youOn what you say or do?I'm only just beginning to see the real youAnd sometimes when we touchThe honesty's too muchAnd I have to close my eyes and hideI wanna hold you til I dieTil we both break down and cryI wanna hold you till the fear in me subsidesRomance and all its strategyLeaves me battling with my prideBut through the insecuritySome tenderness survivesI'm just another writerStill trapped within my truthA hesitant prize fighterStill trapped within my youthAnd sometimes when we touchThe honesty's too muchAnd I have to close my eyes and hideI wanna hold you til I dieTil we both break down and cryI wanna hold you till the fear in me subsidesAt times I'd like to break youAnd drive you to your kneesAt times I'd like to break throughAnd hold you endlesslyAt times I understand youAnd I know how hard you've triedI've watched while love commands youAnd I've watched love pass you byAt times I think we're driftersStill searching for a friendA brother or a sisterBut then the passion flares againAnd sometimes when we touchThe honesty's too muchAnd I have to close my eyes and hideI wanna hold you til I dieTil we both break down and cryI wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides
