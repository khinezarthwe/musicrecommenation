Wake from your sleepThe drying of your tearsToday, we escapeWe escapePack and get dressedBefore your father hears usBefore all hellBreaks looseBreathe, keep breathingDon't lose your nerveBreathe, keep breathingI can't do this aloneSing us a songA song to keep us warmThere's such a chillSuch a chillYou can laughA spineless laughWe hope your rules andWisdom choke youNow we are oneIn everlasting peaceWe hope that you choke that you chokeThat you chokeWe hope that you choke that you chokeThat you chokeWe hope that you choke that you chokeThat you choke
