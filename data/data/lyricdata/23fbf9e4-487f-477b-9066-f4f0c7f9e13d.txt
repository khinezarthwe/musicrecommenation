First love, last love Only love, it's only love First love, last love Only love, it's only love Do you miss home? Do you miss home? And are you cool? Symmetricool? Let's get married And tick the boxes And so she says Oh, let's get married And take the boxes Do you want to be alone? Do you wanna be alone? And are you cool? Symmetrical, hypocritical, analytical, so critical? Nothing's perfect And I'm hoping I'll do, do But I will not do Cos nothing's perfect So I'll have to make do And it's my mistake and no mistake And I would take it back if I could So stay with me tonight Well, I'll make my bed, I'll lie in it And pillow talk you into it I'll make my bed, I'll lie in it Entice you with this leopard print And matching velvet duvet First love, last love Only love, it's only love First love, last love Only love, it's only love Only love Only love It's only love
