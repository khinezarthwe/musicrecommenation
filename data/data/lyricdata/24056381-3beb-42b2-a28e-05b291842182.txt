There's a fragile tensionThat's keeping us goingIt may not last foreverBut, oh, when it's flowingThere's something magical in the airSomething so tragic we have to careThere's a strange obsessionThat's drawing us nearerWe don't understand itIt never gets clearerThere's something mystical in our genesSo simplistic it kicks and screamsOh, when we're teeteringOn the edge of collapseNothing can keep us downThere's a dizzying feelingThat's keeping us flyingThrough glittering galasWithout even tryingThere's something radical in our handsNothing logical to our plans
