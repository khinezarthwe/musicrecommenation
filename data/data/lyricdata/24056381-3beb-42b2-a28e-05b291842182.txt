There's a fragile tension That's keeping us going It may not last forever But, oh, when it's flowing There's something magical in the air Something so tragic we have to care There's a strange obsession That's drawing us nearer We don't understand it It never gets clearer There's something mystical in our genes So simplistic it kicks and screams Oh, when we're teetering On the edge of collapse Nothing can keep us down There's a dizzying feeling That's keeping us flying Through glittering galas Without even trying There's something radical in our hands Nothing logical to our plans
