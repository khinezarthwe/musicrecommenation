Mondays is for drinking to the seldom seen kidI've been working on a cocktail called, whoaPolishing a compass that I hold in my sleep, whoaDoubt comes in on sticks, but then he kicks like a horse, whoaThere's a Chinese cigarette case and the rest you can keepAnd the rest you can keepAnd the rest you can keepThere's a hole in my neighbourhoodDown which of late I cannot help but fallThere's a hole in my neighbourhoodDown which of late I cannot help but fallMondays is for drinking to the seldom seen kidThere's this whispering of jokers doingTo a chorus of supposes from the little town whoresThere'll be twisted karaoke at the Aniseed LoungeAnd I'd bring you further roses but it does you no goodAnd it does me no goodAnd it does you no goodThere's a hole in my neighborhoodDown which of late I cannot help but fallThere's a hole in my neighborhoodDown which of late I cannot help but fallThere's a hole in my neighborhoodDown which of late I cannot help but fallSomeday we'll be drinking with the seldom seen kid
