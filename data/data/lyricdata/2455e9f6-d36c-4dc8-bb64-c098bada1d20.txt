Such a lonely day, and it's mineThe most loneliest day of my lifeSuch a lonely day should be bannedIt's a day that I can't standThe most loneliest day of my lifeThe most loneliest day of my lifeSuch a lonely day shouldn't existIt's a day that I'll never missSuch a lonely day, and it's mineThe most loneliest day of my lifeAnd if you go, I want to go with youAnd if you die, I want to die with youTake your hand and walk awayThe most loneliest day of my lifeThe most loneliest day of my lifeThe most loneliest day of my lifeSuch a lonely day, and it's mineIt's a day that I'm glad I survived
