You walk down Alameda shuffling your deck of trick cards over everyoneLike some precious only son. Face down, bow to the championYou walk down Alameda lookin' at the cracks in the sidewalkThinking about your friends. How you maintain all them in a constant state of suspenseFor your own protection over their affection, nobody broke your heartYou broke your own 'cause you can't finish what you startWalk down Alameda brushing off the nightmares you wish could plague me when I'm awakeSo now you see your first mistake was thinking that you could relateFor one or two minutes she liked you, but the fix is inYou're all pretension; I never pay attention. Nobody broke your heartYou broke your own 'cause you can't finish what you startNobody broke your heart. You broke your own 'cause you can't finish what you startNobody broke your heart. You broke your own 'cause you can't finish what you startNobody broke your heart. If you're alone it must be you that wants to be apart
