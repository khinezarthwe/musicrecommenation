You walk down Alameda shuffling your deck of trick cards over everyone Like some precious only son. Face down, bow to the champion You walk down Alameda lookin' at the cracks in the sidewalk Thinking about your friends. How you maintain all them in a constant state of suspense For your own protection over their affection, nobody broke your heart You broke your own 'cause you can't finish what you start Walk down Alameda brushing off the nightmares you wish could plague me when I'm awake So now you see your first mistake was thinking that you could relate For one or two minutes she liked you, but the fix is in You're all pretension; I never pay attention. Nobody broke your heart You broke your own 'cause you can't finish what you start Nobody broke your heart. You broke your own 'cause you can't finish what you start Nobody broke your heart. You broke your own 'cause you can't finish what you start Nobody broke your heart. If you're alone it must be you that wants to be apart
