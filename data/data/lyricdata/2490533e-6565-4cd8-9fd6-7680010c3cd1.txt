Hey, heyJust one more and I'll walk awayAll the everything you winTurns to nothing todayAnd I forget how to moveWhen my mouth is this dryAnd my eyes are bursting heartsIn a blood-stained skyAh, it was sweetIt was wildAnd oh, how weI trembledStuck in honeyHoney, cling to meSo just one moreJust one more goInspire in me the desire in meTo never go homeAh, just one moreAnd I'll walk awayAll the everything you winTurns to nothing todaySo just one moreJust one more goInspire in me the desire in meTo never go homeTo never go home
