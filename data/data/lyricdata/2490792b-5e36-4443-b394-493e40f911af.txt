'68 Into the world, born The seventies; a breath after the war Life was confusing because of my age Should my eyes open for tomorrows gains(pre) I can't help the way I am There's no trust and there's no end What is my name?(chorus) It will never change So here it stays Forever is my name From now on I can't look the other way But keep in mind, and listen to what I say Take underwing all the ones who are lost And build up around them an infinite wall(pre) Don't you know just who I am Take the hand of the wisdoms friend What is my name(chorus) It's time to change It can't stay the same Revolution is my name(chorus) It will never change, So here it stays Forever is my name What is my name?(x4) Forever What is my name?(x4) Revolution(chorus)
