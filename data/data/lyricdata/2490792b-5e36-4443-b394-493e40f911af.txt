'68 Into the world, bornThe seventies; a breath after the warLife was confusing because of my ageShould my eyes open for tomorrows gains(pre) I can't help the way I amThere's no trust and there's no endWhat is my name?(chorus) It will never changeSo here it staysForever is my nameFrom now on I can't look the other wayBut keep in mind, and listen to what I sayTake underwing all the ones who are lostAnd build up around them an infinite wall(pre) Don't you know just who I amTake the hand of the wisdoms friendWhat is my name(chorus) It's time to changeIt can't stay the sameRevolution is my name(chorus) It will never change, So here it staysForever is my nameWhat is my name?(x4)  ForeverWhat is my name?(x4)  Revolution(chorus)
