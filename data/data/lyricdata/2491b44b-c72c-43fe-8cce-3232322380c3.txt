One just one and then I'll go Though it's on the cards that an argument it's imminent I know But it's not like I get carried home It's just that I believe that she don't think I think of her when I'm on my own, so... Don't think that I don't need Our nights with the T V You're so dear to me but sometimes I like to lose control Just one more I promise then I'll go Now I don't want a scene and have you screaming down the phone You should know the only one I know That will make me laugh with the little things they do is you and only you alone, so... Don't think that I might be Thinking that I might leave You're so dear to me but sometimes I like to lose control Maybe Saturday we'll go out and do something you like' Til that day arrives you should know you're mine Don't think that I don't need Our nights with the T V You're so dear to me but sometimes I like it on my own One thing I know When I go My heart stays at home!
