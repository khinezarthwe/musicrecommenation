One just one and then I'll goThough it's on the cards that an argument it's imminent I knowBut it's not like I get carried homeIt's just that I believe that she don't think I think of her when I'm on my own, so...Don't think that I don't needOur nights with the TVYou're so dear to me but sometimes I like to lose controlJust one more I promise then I'll goNow I don't want a scene and have you screaming down the phoneYou should know the only one I knowThat will make me laugh with the little things they do is you and only you alone, so...Don't think that I might beThinking that I might leaveYou're so dear to me but sometimes I like to lose controlMaybe Saturday we'll go out and do something you like'Til that day arrives you should know you're mineDon't think that I don't needOur nights with the TVYou're so dear to me but sometimes I like it on my ownOne thing I knowWhen I goMy heart stays at home!
