Your day breaksYour mind achesYou find that all her wordsOf kindness linger onWhen she no longer needs youShe wakes upShe makes upShe takes her timeAnd doesn't feel she has to hurryShe no longer needs youAnd in her eyes you see nothingNo sign of love behind the tearsCried for no oneA love that should have lasted yearsYou want herYou need herAnd yet you don't believe herWhen she says her love is deadYou think she needs youAnd in her eyes you see nothingNo sign of love behind the tearsCried for no oneA love that should have lasted yearsYou stay homeShe goes outShe says that long agoShe knew someoneBut now he's goneShe doesn't need himYour day breaksYour mind achesThere will be timesWhen all the things she saidWill fill your headYou won't forget herAnd in her eyes you see nothingNo sign of love behind the tearsCried for no oneA love that should have lasted years
