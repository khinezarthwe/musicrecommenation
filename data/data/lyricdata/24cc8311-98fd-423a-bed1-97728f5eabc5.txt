I'm gonna fight 'em offA seven nation army couldn't hold me backThey're gonna rip it offTaking their time right behind my backAnd I'm talking to myself at nightBecause I can't forgetBack and forth through my mindBehind a cigaretteAnd a message coming from my eyesSays leave it aloneDon't want to hear about itEvery single one's got a story to tellEveryone knows about itFrom the Queen of England to the hounds of hellAnd if I catch it coming back my wayI'm gonna sell it to youAnd that ain't what you want to hearBut that's what I'll doAnd the feeling coming from my bonesSays find a homeI'm going to WichitaFar from this opera forevermoreI'm gonna work the strawMake the sweat drip out of every poreAnd I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleedingRight before the lordAll the words are gonna bleed from meAnd I will think no moreAnd the stains coming from my bloodTell me go back home
