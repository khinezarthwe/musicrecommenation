And the winter moves about IllinoisWhen my sister picks a fightWith the Alexander boyAnd my father locks the car by the storeStill we figure out the keysAnd follow him once moreOh my God, we see it on the floorThe woman on the bedThe ankle brace she woreStones and sledIt could have been some otherThe mind that knows itselfHas a mind to serve the otherBut we run back, scratching at the doorScratching at the doorIf I'm hiding in the sleeves of my coatWhen my father runs undressedHe's pointing at my throatAnd my brother has fit in the snowAnd the traffic stops for milesWe take him by the elbowOh my God, the shuffling and the floorA mind that knows itselfIs a mind that knows much moreSo we run back, scrambling for coverThe mind that knows itselfHas a mind to kill the other(Oh my God, no one came to our sideTo carry us away from danger)Oh my GodHe left us now for deadHe left us now for dead
