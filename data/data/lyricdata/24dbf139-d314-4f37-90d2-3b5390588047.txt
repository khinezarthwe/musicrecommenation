There is no future for us to suture Your life ill-fated, beat down and hated Shot in the head, walking undead Numb to the world, around your head Rip my skin from my bones, I won't bleed Rip my heart from my chest, I won't scream Hide in the shadows, deep black and hollow Empty void of light cuts lean, like a knife Damaged and torn, punctured by thorns I've felt nothing since I was born Rip my skin from my bones, I won't bleed Rip my heart from my chest, I won't scream My flesh - your flesh Your eyes - my sight My pain - your shame We are the same... Rip my skin from my bones, I won't bleed Rip my heart from my chest, I won't scream Rip my skin...
