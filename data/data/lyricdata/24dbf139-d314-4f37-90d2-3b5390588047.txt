There is no future for us to sutureYour life ill-fated, beat down and hatedShot in the head, walking undeadNumb to the world, around your headRip my skin from my bones, I won't bleedRip my heart from my chest, I won't screamHide in the shadows, deep black and hollowEmpty void of light cuts lean, like a knifeDamaged and torn, punctured by thornsI've felt nothing since I was bornRip my skin from my bones, I won't bleedRip my heart from my chest, I won't screamMy flesh - your fleshYour eyes - my sightMy pain - your shameWe are the same...Rip my skin from my bones, I won't bleedRip my heart from my chest, I won't screamRip my skin...
