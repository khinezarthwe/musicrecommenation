Chaotic violence in my eyesThis whole world moves backwardsPeace, another sign that liesLife today is not worth the painOn the radio, another homicideInmates suffocate in jailSevered heads of revoltI wish I'd never been bornSame hand that builds - destroysSame hand that relieves - betraysSame hand that seeds - burnsSame peace that exists - here liesI can't trust anymoreCriminals within the lawI have something to sayWhere I live, don't believe in another dayHeresy and graftApartheidSame religion that saves - damns you!
