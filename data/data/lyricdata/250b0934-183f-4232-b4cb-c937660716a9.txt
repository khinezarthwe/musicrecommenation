There's a vulture perching right offscreenAnd it's bitter and whispers chaotic thingsAnd the weeps turn quick into bullyingIt's so easy to see everyone can agree stop listeningI know you've heard it beforeBut then it wasn't enoughYou don't want to be held back from the substitutionI know you've seen this beforeAnd now enough is too muchYou don't want to be set back when the substitution comesI'm sorryYou're a marionette in the center ofThe twisting of strings coming from aboveIt may seem too deep to recover fromIt's so easy to see everyone can agree just let it goI know you've heard it beforeBut then it wasn't enoughYou don't want to be held back from the substitutionI know you've seen this beforeAnd now enough is too muchYou don't want to be set back when the substitution comesI'm sorryI'm sorryWhen the voices start spitting just be awareI've brought enough stones for us to shareThat one's grinning, that one's burning aim for the throatLet 'em choke on the stones that we have to throwIt's the great downfallThe big overthrowIf we shoot them downIt'll make you soarWhen reactions turn into hurricanesAnd the middle ground seems a little tameWhether full or empty, it's all the sameIt's so easy to see everyone can agree you're not to blameI know you've heard it beforeBut then it wasn't enoughYou don't want to be held back from the substitutionI know you've seen this beforeBut now enough is too muchYou don't want to be set back when the substitution comesI'm sorry
