As I hold the key to the back doorof the world I feel my Hand touching bounds never had before. I can view the power of my position and myeyes can see more than anyone in any place, I'll play the game and never ever lose. I'm the king in fighting competitionand the other piecesare there for my art and my tactics now. All my games are won before they're played for I have planned that no opposition can stage a fight I'll play the game and never ever lose. My thoughts never spoken only thevisions inside my head the truth never brokenwithin my silent words left unsaid. I will steer the helm of all the nationas the captaintake my rewards for all the good I'm doing now,and no words that I'm the knave will alter myphilosophy for if any are heard, the games startedagain I'll never ever lose.
