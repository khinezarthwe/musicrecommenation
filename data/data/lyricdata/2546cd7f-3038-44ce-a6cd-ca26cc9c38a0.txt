No more tears and you'll be fineI stay here all nightAnd when I've stayed all nightWe go out in the morning lightAnd then you try to live the dayI don't know how, but I know what to sayIs it medicine or social skillDon't have the answer and nobody willYou go screaming on without a wordBeing sad is a fulltime  workAnd now the day has come to an endAnd then you start to cry againIs it medicine?Is it medicine, is it medicine or social skill?Is it medicine, is it medicine, is it medicine or social skill?
