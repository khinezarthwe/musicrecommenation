You make motion when you cry You're making people's lives feel less private Don't take time away You make motion when you cry We all hold hands, can we all hold hands When we make new plans? I pretend like no one else to try control myself I'm subtle like a lion's cage, such a cautious display Remember take hold of your time here Give some meanings to the means to your end Not even jail
