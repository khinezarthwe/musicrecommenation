I'd be lying if I did now say I wasn't intrigued But timing is everything here,and for the moment the "we" is reprieved But, as I watch the girl unfold before my eyes, I discover That I like her Would you please get out from under my skin?' Cause I can't begin this yet And I don't know what my intentions are They're speaking in a different tongue And deep inside, I'm not as tough as I seem But I won't let you know Until it's right, I'm gonna stay my distance And you should go I'm in the dance, and it's a chance But stay and watch awhile I'll be singing a tune just for you with a smile And maybe, if I'm lucky You'll tip your hat to me, and you'll discover That you like her Would you please get out from under my skin?' Cause I can't begin this yet And I don't know what my intentions are They're speaking in a different tongue And, deep inside, I'm not as tough as I seem But I won't let you know Until it's right, I'm gonna stay my distance And you should go Crazy as it all plays out I think I'm lonelier than I've ever been before' Cause I was so close To going through that door But I don't want to be to blame for them I don't want to be to blame Oh, would you please get out from under my skin?' Cause I can't begin this yet And I don't know what my intentions are They're speaking in a different tongue And, deep inside, I'm not as tough as I seem But I won't let you know Until it's right, I'm gonna stay my distance, and you should go Oh, would you please get out I'm not as strong as I seem, but I won't let you know
