I've searched the holy booksTried to unravel the mystery of Jesus Christ, the saviourI've read the poets and the analystsSearched through the books on human behaviourI travelled the whole world aroundFor an answer that refused to be foundI don't know why and I don't know howBut she's nobody's baby nowI loved her then and I guess I love her stillHers is the face I see when a certain mood moves inShe lives in my blood and skinHer wild feral stare, her dark hairHer winter lips as cold as stoneYeah, I was her manBut there are some things even love won't allowI held her hand but I don't hold it nowI don't know why and I don't know howBut she's nobody's baby nowThis is her dress that I loved bestWith the blue quilted violets across the breastAnd these are my many lettersTorn to pieces by her long-fingered handI was her cruel-hearted manAnd though I've tried to lay her ghost downShe's moving through me, even nowI don't know why and I don't know howBut she's nobody's baby now
