Why do we never get an answerWhen we're knocking at the doorWith a thousand million questionsAbout hate and death and war?'Cause when we stop and look around usThere is nothing that we needIn a world of persecutionThat is burning in its greedWhy do we never get an answerWhen we're knocking at the door?Because the truth is hard to swallowThat's what the war of love is forIt's not the way that you say itWhen you do those things to meIt's more the way that you mean itWhen you tell me what will beAnd when you stop and think about itYou won't believe it's trueThat all the love you've been givingHas all been meant for youI'm looking for someone to change my lifeI'm looking for a miracle in my lifeAnd if you could seeWhat it's done to meTo lose the the love I knewCould safely lead me throughBetween the silence of the mountainsAnd the crashing of the seaThere lies a land I once lived inAnd she's waiting there for meBut in the grey of the morningMy mind becomes confusedBetween the dead and the sleepingAnd the road that I must chooseI'm looking for someone to change my lifeI'm looking for a miracle in my lifeAnd if you could seeWhat it's done to meTo lose the love I knewCould safely lead me toThe land that I once knewTo learn as we grow oldThe secrets of our soulsIt's not the way that you say itWhen you do those things to meIt's more the way you really mean itWhen you tell me what will beWhy do we never get an answerWhen we're knocking at the doorWith a thousand million questionsAbout hate and death and war?'Cause when we stop and look around usThere is nothing that we needIn a world of persecutionThat is burning in its greedWhy do we never get an answerWhen we're knocking at the door?
