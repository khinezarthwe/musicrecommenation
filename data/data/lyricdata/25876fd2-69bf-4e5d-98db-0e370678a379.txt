I'd rather be liberated, I find myself captivatedStop doing what you keep doing it tooI'd rather stay bold and lonely, I dream I'm your one and onlyStop doing what you keep doing it tooThings are getting strange, I'm starting to worryThis could be a case for Mulder and ScullyThings are getting strange, now I can't sleep aloneI'd rather be jumping ship, I find myself jumping straight inStop doing what you keep doing it too...Forever be dozy and dim, I wake myself thinking of himStop doing what you keep doing it too...Things are getting strange, I'm starting to worryThis could be a case for Mulder and ScullyThings are getting strange, now I can't sleep aloneHere my bed is made for two and there's nothing I can doSo tell me something I don't know.If my head is full you, is there nothing I can do?Must we all march in two by two by two?And as for some happy ending. I'd rather stay single and thinStop doing what youKeep doing to me...Things are getting strange, I'm starting to worryThis could be a case for Mulder and ScullyThings are getting strange, now I can't sleep alone... hereThings are getting strange, I'm starting to worryThis could be a case for Mulder and ScullyThings are getting strange, now I can't sleep aloneSo what have you got to say to that?And what does someone do without love?And what does someone do with love?And what have you got to say about that?
