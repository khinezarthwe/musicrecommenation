I'm just the pieces of the man I used to beToo many bitter tears are raining down on meI'm far away from homeAnd I've been facing this aloneFor much too longI feel like no-one ever told the truth to meAbout growing up and what a struggle it would beIn my tangled state of mindI've been looking back to findWhere I went wrongToo much love will kill youIf you can't make up your mindTorn between the loverAnd the love you leave behindYou're headed for disaster'cos you never read the signsToo much love will kill youEvery timeI'm just the shadow of the man I used to beAnd it seems like there's no way out of this for meI used to bring you sunshineNow all I ever do is bring you downHow would it be if you were standing in my shoesCan't you see that it's impossible to chooseNo there's no making sense of itEvery way I go I'm bound to loseToo much love will kill youJust as sure as none at allIt'll drain the power that's in youMake you plead and scream and crawlAnd the pain will make you crazyYou're the victim of your crimeToo much love will kill youEvery timeToo much love will kill youIt'll make your life a lieYes, too much love will kill youAnd you won't understand whyYou'd give your life, you'd sell your soulBut here it comes againToo much love will kill youIn the end...In the end
