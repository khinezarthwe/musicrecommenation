When I was a younger man When I was a silly boy I didn't need a thing I was strong as anything I viewed solitude as a joy But since I met you I'm distraught You wandered in and now I'm caught I never thought I would see Someone so truly good Someone who's so everything I'm not I want to spend my life with you Don't want to live all alone I can't conceive of the years left to me Without you in our home But what if what if what if what If it's not perfect then it's not But every care I take Nothing I won't forsake To dwell beside what you've got Every time I think about you I think I can't live without you I tell you something I am nothing without you I want to spend my life with you Don't want to live all alone I can't conceive of the years left to me Without you in our home I want to spend my life with you Don't want to live all alone I can't conceive of the years left to me Without you in our home Without you in our home
