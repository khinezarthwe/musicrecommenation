When I was a younger manWhen I was a silly boyI didn't need a thingI was strong as anythingI viewed solitude as a joyBut since I met you I'm distraughtYou wandered in and now I'm caughtI never thought I would seeSomeone so truly goodSomeone who's so everything I'm notI want to spend my life with youDon't want to live all aloneI can't conceive of the years left to meWithout you in our homeBut what if what if what if whatIf it's not perfect then it's notBut every care I takeNothing I won't forsakeTo dwell beside what you've gotEvery time I think about youI think I can't live without youI tell you something I am nothing without youI want to spend my life with youDon't want to live all aloneI can't conceive of the years left to meWithout you in our homeI want to spend my life with youDon't want to live all aloneI can't conceive of the years left to meWithout you in our homeWithout you in our home
