Had you there in the palm of my hand. Saw that smile you give that girl. Haven't seen that smile such a long time. Don't do this to me, again. I watched you laugh when you walked out through door, Couldn't save you from yourself. Haven't seen that smile for such a long while. Don't do this to me again. So I went out,to find out what I was looking for. Found the key,key to our door. It's all of your lies. Still I can't forget. Don't do this to me again. Had you there in the palm of my hand. Saw that smile you give that girl. Haven't seen that smile such a long time. Don't do this to me again. Don't do this to me...... again. Powered by stardust.
