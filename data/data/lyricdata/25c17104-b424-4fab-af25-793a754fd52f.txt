You were on my mind at least nine tenths of yesterday It seemed as if perhaps I'd gone insane What is it about you that has commandeered my brain? Maybe it's your awesome songs or maybe it's the way When I look at your face I can tell that you're not going to be stopping soon or even slowing down And if we keep up this pace pretty soon we'll know the name of every kid and every grown up booking house shows in their town And if home is really where the heart is Then we're the smartest kids I know Because wherever we are in this great big world We'll never be more than a few hours from home And that's important because I need to travel I've had this itchin in my shoes since I was just a little kid And before I had a mini van I rode the Greyhound bus My mom would say " I hope some day you get paid for being Kimya Dawson" And now I do and it's not much But it's enough I've got my Scrabble game, food on my plate, good friends and family And now there's you understanding why I do the things I do Knowing that you do them too makes me really happy On the road again Just can't wait to get on the road again The life I love is makin' music with my friends And I can't wait to get on the road again On the road again Just can't wait to get on the road again The life I love is makin' music with my friends And I can't wait to get on the road again From a distance, the world looks blue and green And the snow capped mountains white From a distance, the ocean meets the stream And the eagle takes to flight( Whispering) Darkness Imprisoning me All that I see Absolute horror I cannot live I cannot die Trapped in myself Body my holding cell Do do do do do do do Do do do do do do do Do do do do do do do Do do do do do do do I'll be your cryin' shoulder I'll be love's suicide I'll be dun-ah dun-ah dun-ah I'll be the greatest man of your life' Cause I like going for hikes and riding bikes And playing video games in the middle of the night And I'll stay up late and I won't even care That we're getting up early to go to the state fair I'm gonna ride the biggest ride, it'll be out of sight Then I'll share an elephant ear with you if you'd like Because we are alive so we've gotta live life To the fullest you spin the bottle and I'll dim the lights Four five six seven minutes in the closet You were on my mind at least nine tenths of yesterday It seemed as if perhaps I'd gone insane What is it about you that has commandeered my brain? Maybe it's your awesome songs or maybe it's the way You go straight to the top you're not scared of getting squashed You know just when to jump off You are so brave And then you run to the right it seems there's no hope in sight And you drop down to the tube that takes you right to level eight Life is a highway and I'm gonna ride it Every day's a winding road yeah My rollercoaster's got the biggest ups and downs As long as it keeps goin' round its unbelievable Life is a highway and I'm gonna ride it Every day's a winding road yeah My rollercoaster's got the biggest ups and downs As long as it keeps goin' round its unbelievable
