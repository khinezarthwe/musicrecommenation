In a matter of a momentLost till the end of timeIt's the evening of another dayAnd the end of mineNow the starlight which has found meLost for a million yearsTries to linger as it fills my eyesTill it disappearsCould it be that somebody else isLooking into my mindSome other placeSomewhereSome other timeSome other placeSomewhereSome other timeLike a mirror held before meLarge as the sky is wideAnd the image is reflectedBack to the other sideCould it be that somebody else isLooking into my mindSome other placeSomewhereSome other timeSome other placeSomewhereSome other time
