My sisters and IHave one wish before we dieAnd it may sound strangeAs if our minds are derangedPlease don't ask us whyBeneath the sheltering skyWe have this strange obsessionYou have the means in your possessionTea in the Sahara with youTea in the Sahara with youThe young man agreedHe would satisfy their needSo they danced for his pleasureWith a joy you could not measureThey'd wait for him hereThe same place every yearBeneath the sheltering skyAcross the desert he would flyTea in the Sahara with youTea in the Sahara with youTea in the Sahara with youTea in the Sahara with youThe sky turned to blackWould he ever come backThey would climb a high duneThey would pray to the moonBut he'd never returnSo the sisters would burnAs their eyes searched the landWith their cups still full of sandTea in the Sahara with youTea in the Sahara with youTea in the Sahara with youTea in the Sahara with you
