That summer I did nothingJust sleeping, thinking and hanging aroundLeft the dark streets of SeptemberAs the air was cooling downWoah yeah it was cooling downI need the sunshine in the morningI'm heading for the open roadSunshine in the morningLord you gotta let it flowEver since I lost herSeems the more I learn, the less I knowEveryday I think about herBut if I look back I'll turn to stoneTo stone, woah yeah gonna turn to stoneI need the sunshine in the morningI'm heading for the open roadSunshine in the morningLord you gotta let it flowI need the sunshine in the morningYeah I gotta feel its glowSunshine in the morningLord you gotta let it flowI'm heading for the open roadI'm heading for the open roadI'm heading for the open roadI'm heading for the open roadI'm heading for the open roadI'm heading for the open roadI'm heading for the open roadI'm heading for the open roadIt hit me without warningI was left out on my ownThe sad times they were formingI went through them aloneA new day it is dawningI feel the pain is goneThe open world is callingAnd I am moving onI need the sunshine in the morningI'm heading for the open roadSunshine in the morningLord you gotta let it flowI need the sunshine in the morningYeah I gotta feel its glowSunshine in the morningLord you gotta let it flow
