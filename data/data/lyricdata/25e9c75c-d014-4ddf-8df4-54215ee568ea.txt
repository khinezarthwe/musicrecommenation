Ten years ago, on a cold dark nightSomeone was killed 'neath the town hall lightThere were few at the scene, but they all agreedThat the slayer who ran looked a lot like meThe judge said: Son, what is your alibi?If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to dieI spoke not a word, though it meant my lifeFor I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wifeShe walks these hills in a long black veilShe visits my grave when the night winds wailNobody knows, nobody seesNobody knows but meOh, the scaffold is high, and eternity's nearShe stood in the crowd and shed not a tearBut late at night, when the north wind blowsIn a long black veil, she cries over my bonesShe walks these hills in a long black veilShe visits my grave when the night winds wailNobody knows, nobody seesNobody knows but me
