The beast and dragon, adoredYou been gone so longWhere you been for so longI went to places unknownRented a roomAnd I forgot my penShook my twinAnd I had to find the feelin againNow all I need is a crewOne that can act as ifOne that can slay on cueAnd sneeze and sniffUh-huh alrightI'm going back to the waterBeen landlocked too longI got a feelin it don't come cheapI got a feelin oh and then it got to meIt took its time a-working into my soulI got to believe it come from rock and rollBelieve it come from rock and rollWhere did you get for so longI been learning my sceneI been watching my friends move awayI summon my love back to meAnd I went down by the seawallThat's when I knew, knew They Never Got YouGreat dominions they don't come cheapGreat dominions they just want you to leaveI got the meaning the meanings air tightSaid it's not what you expected but it could be rightI got a feelin it didn't come freeI got a feelin and then it got to meWhen you don't feel it it shows they tear out your soulAnd when you believe they call it rock and rollAnd when you believe they call it rock and roll
