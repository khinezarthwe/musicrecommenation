The beast and dragon, adored You been gone so long Where you been for so long I went to places unknown Rented a room And I forgot my pen Shook my twin And I had to find the feelin again Now all I need is a crew One that can act as if One that can slay on cue And sneeze and sniff Uh-huh alright I'm going back to the water Been landlocked too long I got a feelin it don't come cheap I got a feelin oh and then it got to me It took its time a-working into my soul I got to believe it come from rock and roll Believe it come from rock and roll Where did you get for so long I been learning my scene I been watching my friends move away I summon my love back to me And I went down by the seawall That's when I knew, knew They Never Got You Great dominions they don't come cheap Great dominions they just want you to leave I got the meaning the meanings air tight Said it's not what you expected but it could be right I got a feelin it didn't come free I got a feelin and then it got to me When you don't feel it it shows they tear out your soul And when you believe they call it rock and roll And when you believe they call it rock and roll
