One day I met a precious soul Whose words had touched my heart His poetry resounded so It tore my soul apart But when I tried my thoughts to speak Emotion made my mind so weak And time stood still for years and years I bathed him in my tears I cried, I cried Tears of joy tears of pain I cried, I cried Tears of love again and again Some people turn to pills and things To help them through the day To take them up or down or just To ease the blues away But me I really want to feel The ups and downs of life so real Happy or sad emotions reign My tears flow just the same I cried, I cried Tears of joy tears of pain I cried, I cried Tears of love again and again I cried, I cried Tears of joy tears of pain I cried, I cried Tears of love again and again Gonna burn so completely I leave no trace Though so many out there would laugh in my face For wearing emotion so close to the skin Condemn me they might if to love's such a sin I cried, I cried Tears of joy tears of pain I cried, I cried Tears of love again and again I cried, I cried Tears of joy tears of pain I cried, I cried Tears of love again and again
