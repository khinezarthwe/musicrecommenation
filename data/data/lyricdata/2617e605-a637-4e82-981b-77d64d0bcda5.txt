One day I met a precious soulWhose words had touched my heartHis poetry resounded soIt tore my soul apartBut when I tried my thoughts to speakEmotion made my mind so weakAnd time stood still for years and yearsI bathed him in my tearsI cried, I criedTears of joy tears of painI cried, I criedTears of love again and againSome people turn to pills and thingsTo help them through the dayTo take them up or down or justTo ease the blues awayBut me I really want to feelThe ups and downs of life so realHappy or sad emotions reignMy tears flow just the sameI cried, I criedTears of joy tears of painI cried, I criedTears of love again and againI cried, I criedTears of joy tears of painI cried, I criedTears of love again and againGonna burn so completely I leave no traceThough so many out there would laugh in my faceFor wearing emotion so close to the skinCondemn me they might if to love's such a sinI cried, I criedTears of joy tears of painI cried, I criedTears of love again and againI cried, I criedTears of joy tears of painI cried, I criedTears of love again and again
