Winding is this road of yours(Walk on your own)Confident of early scores(They will be gone)Waiting is my favourite bore(Maybe you'll see)Thwarted love will hurt me more(Reconcile me)A million of worse thingsWorse than kissing youAn angel with black wingsWill finally proveThat. This. Is. LoveYou predict a common end(Fresh out of lies)Kiss me make my backbone bend(Sweet as your cries)Spread your wings and make a turn(Make them all see)Let me feel that angry burn(In love with me)A million of worse thingsWorse than kissing youAn angel with black wingsWill finally proveThat. This. Is. Love
