In a dream, I saw you walkin'Like a kid alive and talkin', that was youIn the classroom, you were teachin'On the streets you were policin' that was youTo the one I now know mostI will tell them of your ghost like a thing that never, ever wasAnd all that ever matteredWill some day turn back to batter like a jokeBehind thin walls, you hid your feelingsTakes four legs to make a ceilin' like a thingIn a dream I saw you walkin'With your friends alive and talkin', that was youWell I saw it in your movementsAnd even though you never knew it, well I knewJust how sweet it could beIf you'd never left these streetsYou had me worried, so worried that this would lastYou had me worried, so worried that this would lastBut now I'm learning, learning that this will passBut now I'm learning, learning that this will pass
