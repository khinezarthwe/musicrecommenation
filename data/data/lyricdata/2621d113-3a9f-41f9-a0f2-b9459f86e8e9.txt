Sitting on the park bench Eyeing little girls with bad intent Yeah-eah Ah Snot running down his nose Greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes Hey, Aqualung Drying in the cold sun Watching as the frilly panties run Hey, Aqualung Feeling like a dead duck Spitting out pieces of his broken luck Oh, Aqualung Sun streaking cold An old man wandering lonely Taking time the only way he knows Leg hurtin' bad As he bends to pick a dog-end He goes down to the bog and warms his feet Feeling alone The army's up the road Salvation à la mode and a cup of tea Aqualung, my friend Don't you start away uneasy You poor old sod, you see, it's only me Yeah Do you still remember December's foggy freeze? When the ice that clings onto your beard Was screaming agony? Hey! And you snatch your rattling last breaths With deep-sea diver sounds And the flowers bloom like Madness in the spring Sun streaking cold An old man wandering lonely Taking time the only way he knows Leg hurting bad As he bends to pick a dog-end He goes down to the bog and warms his feet Oh-oh-oh Feeling alone The army's up the road Salvation à la mode and a cup of tea Aqualung, my friend Don't you start away uneasy You poor old sod, you see, it's only me Me Oh-oh-oh Dee dee dee dee Dee dee dee dee dee dee Dee dee dee dee dee dee Dee dee dee dee Aqualung, my friend Don't you start away uneasy You poor old sod, you see, it's only me, yeah Hmm Sitting on the park bench Eyeing little girls with bad intent, yeah Snot running down his nose Greasy fingers smearing shabby clothes Hey, Aqualung Drying in the cold sun Watching as the frilly panties run Hey, Aqualung Feeling like a dead duck Spitting out pieces of his broken luck Hey, Aqualung Ow!
