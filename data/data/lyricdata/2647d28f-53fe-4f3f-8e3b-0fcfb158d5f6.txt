Faint light of dawnI'm listening to you breathing in and outNeeding nothingYou're honey dippedYou are beautiful, floating clouds, soft worldI can't feel my lipsI'm going down, I don't want to changeI'm going down, going down the drainDon't bring me down, I beg youDon't bring me down, I won't let youDon't bring me downThen all of that's anulled and I'm anyone'sEveryone's, we are oneYour face becomes the sunAnd I'm addicted to the joy that the little thingsThose little thingsThe little things they bringI'm going down, I don't want to changeI'm going down, going down the drainDon't bring me down, I beg youDon't bring me down, I won't let youDon't bring me down
