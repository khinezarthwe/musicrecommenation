Like lust has yet to fail meNo power to subsideMy instincts never brokenThis downfall so close at handThe thing that scares me mostIs the fear I see in othersAnd the thing that reallyFrightens me to the coreIs when I see that fear in youLike shields against the actionNo enemy to subdueWe barricade foreverThe which hides inside of us allThe thing that scares me the mostIs the fear I see in othersThe thing that reallyFrightens me to the coreIs when I see that fear in youTo break the rules and patternsWhen you're scared enoughBefore the end is hereAre you scared enoughAre you scared enoughAre you scared enoughThe thing that scares me the mostIs the fear I see in othersThat look that sends shiversDown my spineWill haunt me to the endOf living days and nightsYou're the thing that matters to me mostAnd I sense this fear in you
