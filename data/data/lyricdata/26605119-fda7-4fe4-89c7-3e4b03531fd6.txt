Like lust has yet to fail me No power to subside My instincts never broken This downfall so close at hand The thing that scares me most Is the fear I see in others And the thing that really Frightens me to the core Is when I see that fear in you Like shields against the action No enemy to subdue We barricade forever The which hides inside of us all The thing that scares me the most Is the fear I see in others The thing that really Frightens me to the core Is when I see that fear in you To break the rules and patterns When you're scared enough Before the end is here Are you scared enough Are you scared enough Are you scared enough The thing that scares me the most Is the fear I see in others That look that sends shivers Down my spine Will haunt me to the end Of living days and nights You're the thing that matters to me most And I sense this fear in you
