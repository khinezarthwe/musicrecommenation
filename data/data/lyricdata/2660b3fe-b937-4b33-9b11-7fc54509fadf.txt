He's pleased to meet you underneath the horse in the cathedral with the glass stained blackSinging sweet high notes that echo back to destroy their masterMay be a long time 'til you get the call-up but it's sure as fate and hard as your luckNo one'll know where you areIt's just a brief smile crossing your faceI'm running speed trials standing in placeWhen the socket's not a shock enough. You little child, what makes you think you're tough?When all the people you think you're above, they all know what's the matterYou're such a pinball, yeah, you know it's true. There's always something you go back running toTo follow the path of no resistanceIt's just a brief smile crossing your faceI'm running speed trials standing in placeIt's just a brief smile crossing your faceI'm running speed trials all over the place
