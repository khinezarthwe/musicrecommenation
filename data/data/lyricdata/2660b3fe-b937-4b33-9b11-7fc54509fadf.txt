He's pleased to meet you underneath the horse in the cathedral with the glass stained black Singing sweet high notes that echo back to destroy their master May be a long time 'til you get the call-up but it's sure as fate and hard as your luck No one'll know where you are It's just a brief smile crossing your face I'm running speed trials standing in place When the socket's not a shock enough. You little child, what makes you think you're tough? When all the people you think you're above, they all know what's the matter You're such a pinball, yeah, you know it's true. There's always something you go back running to To follow the path of no resistance It's just a brief smile crossing your face I'm running speed trials standing in place It's just a brief smile crossing your face I'm running speed trials all over the place
