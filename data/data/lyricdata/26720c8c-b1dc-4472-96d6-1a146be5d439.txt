Backseat of your family station wagon, listening Nina Simone One Hundred years of solitude and only 12 years old God make up your mind God make up your mind Do you wanna play fair Or should I take what's mine Your mom is calling out, " Look at the Grand Canyon" Camilla couldn't care less Gaze into the hole Your stomach feels the emptiness of death God make up your mind God make up your mind Do you wanna play fair Or should I take what's mine, like everyone else From New York to New Orleans, played alphabet Kansas to Boise, won the battleship Memorized the capitals, crossword puzzles Drew a picture of a cat laying dead in the street Daydream about my real dad back in California Elephant in your brain, reminding you you've got to make a choice Wraps his arms around you slow Cause you tense up like an armadillo God make up your mind God make up your mind Do you wanna play fair Or should I take what's mine, like everyone else Why ain't my teacher on a street sign? He's done so much more than politicians, dead musicians You wanna help someone you gotta be a no one That's what I figured out the cat in the street meant You gotta make up your mind Make up your mind Make up your mind
