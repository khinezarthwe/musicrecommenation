Baby I've been here beforeI've seen this room and I've walked this floorI used to live alone before I knew youI've seen your flag on the marble archBut love is not some victory marchIt's a cold and it's a broken hallelujahHallelujah, hallelujahHallelujah, hallelujahThere was a time when you let me knowWhat's really going on belowBut now you never show that to me, do you?Remember when I moved in youAnd the Holy dove was moving tooAnd every breath we drew was hallelujahHallelujah, hallelujahHallelujah, hallelujah
