Baby I've been here before I've seen this room and I've walked this floor I used to live alone before I knew you I've seen your flag on the marble arch But love is not some victory march It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah Hallelujah, hallelujah Hallelujah, hallelujah There was a time when you let me know What's really going on below But now you never show that to me, do you? Remember when I moved in you And the Holy dove was moving too And every breath we drew was hallelujah Hallelujah, hallelujah Hallelujah, hallelujah
