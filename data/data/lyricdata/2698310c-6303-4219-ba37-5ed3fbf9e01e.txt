We rented a truck and a semi to goTravel down the long and winding roadLook on the map, I think we've been here beforeClose the doors, let's roll once moreCop on the corner, look he's startin' to writeI don't need no ticket so I screamed out of sightDrove so fast that my eyes can't seeLook in the mirror, is he still followin' me?Let it rollDown the highwayLet it rollDown the highwayRoll, rollLook at the sign, we're in the wrong placeMove on boys, let's get ready to race454 Coming over the hillThe man on patrol is going to give us a billThe time's real short, you know the distance is longI'd rather have a jet but it's not in the songClimb back in the cab, cross your fingers for luckWe gotta keep movin' if we're going to make a buckLet it rollDown the highwayLet it rollDown the highwayRollLet it rollLet it rollLet it rollLet it rollLet it rollDown the highwayLet it rollDown the highwayLet it rollDown the highwayLet it rollDown the highwayRoll, roll, rollLet it rollDown the highwayLet it rollDown the highwayRoll, roll, roll
