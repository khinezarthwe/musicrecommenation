I gotta keep running " I'm starting over" I do for fun and " I'm starting over" I'm low and I love it " I'm starting over" Gotta keep gunnin' " I'm starting over" We'll its just a wasted year I'm doing my time If things don't go right I'll drink some more beer And I'll blow I blow out my mind Well I'm lucid " I'm starting over" Stop acting stupid " I'm starting over" Where the fuck is my cupid " I'm starting over" Gotta stop juicin' " I'm starting over" We'll its just a wasted year I'm doing my time If things don't go right I'll drink some more beer And things will be fine My wounds wont stop oozing " I'm starting over" Tired of boozing " I'm starting over" Gotta stop choosin' " I'm starting over" Gotta quit losin' " I'm starting over"
