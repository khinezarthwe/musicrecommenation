I gotta keep running "I'm starting over"I do for fun and "I'm starting over"I'm low and I love it "I'm starting over"Gotta keep gunnin' "I'm starting over"We'll its just a wasted yearI'm doing my timeIf things don't go right I'll drink some more beerAnd I'll blow I blow out my mindWell I'm lucid "I'm starting over"Stop acting stupid "I'm starting over"Where the fuck is my cupid "I'm starting over"Gotta stop juicin' "I'm starting over"We'll its just a wasted yearI'm doing my timeIf things don't go right I'll drink some more beerAnd things will be fineMy wounds wont stop oozing "I'm starting over"Tired of boozing "I'm starting over"Gotta stop choosin' "I'm starting over"Gotta quit losin' "I'm starting over"
