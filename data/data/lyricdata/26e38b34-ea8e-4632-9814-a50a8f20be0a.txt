The dark descends through the promised landDown kingdom come and the acid banI'm bad alone, burned inside outNothing to kill itI hit the cityIn Marianne I dug the holeAnd watched her trip on my heart of stoneAnd in the end all that crawled, was my skinI couldn't kill itI hit the cityI hit the cityGhost arrives at its bitter endTo the promised land and the dark descentsI'm bad alone, burned inside outNothing to kill itI hit the cityI hit the cityI hit the cityI hit the cityI hit the city1,2,3,4I hit the city
