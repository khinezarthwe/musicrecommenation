(Bonefish)(Bonefish)A peacebone got found in the dinosaur wingWell I've been jumpin' all over, but my views were slowly shrinkingI was a jugular vein in a juggler's girlI was supposedly leaking the most interesting colorsWhile half of my fingers are dipped in the sandYou progress in letters but you're used to cooking broccoliThe other side of takeout is mildew on riceAnd an obsession with the past is like a dead flyAnd just a few things are related to the old timesThen we did believe in magic and we didn't dieIt's not my words that you should follow, it's your insidesYou're just an inside, adjust your insidesYou're just an inside(Bonefish)I bet the monster was happy when we made him a maze'Cause he don't understand intentions and he just looks at your faceI bet the bubbles exploded to tickle the bathAnd all the birds are very curious, all the fish were at the surfaceWith half of me waiting for myself to get calmI'm like a pelican at red tide, I'm a corpse, I'm not a fishermanA blow out does not mean I will have a good nightAnd an obsession with the past is like a dead flyAnd just a few things are related to the old timesThen we did believe in magic and we didn't dieIt's not my words that you should follow, it's your insidesYou're just an inside, adjust your insidesYou're just an inside(Bonefish)Yakum, yakum, yakum, yakumYakum, yakum, yakum, yakumYakum, yakum, yakum, yakum(Bonefish)Well I start in a hose and I'll end in a yardWhen I feel like I'm stealing, I can't keep myself from hearing GodOnly the taste of your cooking can make me bow on the groundIt was the clouds that carved the mountainsIt was the mountains that made the kids screamOh well, she bore all her parts but she never was foundYou think I'll carve a path through New York and be an artist, but are you anything?Then you find out that you can't ask a baby to cryAnd an obsession with the past is like a dead flyAnd just a few things are related to the old timesThen we did believe in magic and we didn't dieIt's not my words that you should follow, it's your insidesYou're just an inside, adjust your insidesYou're just an insideInside, insideInside, insideInside, insideInsidePeacebone, peacebonePeacebone, peacebonePeacebone, peacebonePeacebone, peacebonePeacebone, peacebonePeacebone, peacebonePeacebone(Bonefish)
