Crawl inside it Become the sickness Drink it Elevate the threshold Destroy the mind And you suffocate You learn to hate yourself And take on the blame And it burns (sweeping the ghost away, but they keep coming back) And it burns (the sky is turning red) It burns (we're right at the end) And it's all dead quiet At the centre of the pain Tighten the noose Ascend the scaffold And give in Assume the position Bow down your head A ritual to purify Undo what is Absolve Everlasting The torture And it's all dead quiet At the centre of the pain(x2)
