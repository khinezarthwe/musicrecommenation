Come!   See!   High above.Come!   See!   High in the heavensa  new  star  shining bright;out of the darkness comes a light.Come!  Hear midnight chimes.Come!  Hear bells that are ringingand  from  some distant shoresounds of a journey echo on.This is the night,they say,everyone wants a dream.This is the night,they say,nothing is as it seems.Come!   Sleep!  Close your eyes.Come!   Sleep!  Give me your sorrowand I’ll keep watch for youuntil the dawn is breaking through,until the morning wakens you.Come!   Dream through the night.Come!   Dream, and then tomorrowyou’ll   see   your   heart will knowdreams are more precious than gold.Dreams are more precious than gold.Dreams are more precious than gold.
