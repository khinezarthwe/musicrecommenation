I know you're the only one who understandsAfore ye go, before you leaveYou always shake my handEven when I'm crazy, on fire and nakedJust as Nature intendedNo style but easily blendedYou always know where I'll be foundHanging somewhere near the groundHelp me up or help me downDon't want to lose those daysWhen everything is just a hazeI'm dreamingI believe I could walk before I learned to crawlWhen I look up, the Devil's looking backFrom the mirror on the wallYou can open the doorGot my feet stuck to the floorI may have lost my wayBut I didn't get where I am todayDon't want to lose those daysWhen everything is just a hazeI'm dreamingYou spin into my empty roomAnd once again I'm almost humanAlmost human
