AhhThought you'd be looking for the next in line to loveThen ignore, put out and put awayAnd so you'd soon be leaving meAlone like I'm supposed to beTonight, tomorrow and everydayThere's nothing here that you'll missI can guarantee you thisIs a cloud of smokeTrying to occupy spaceWhat a fucking jokeWhat a fucking jokeAhhI waited for a bus to separate the both of usAnd take me off far away from you'Cause my feelings never change a bitI always feel like shitI don't know why, I guess that I just doYou once talked to me about loveAnd you painted pictures ofA Never-NeverlandAnd I could've gone to that placeBut I didn't understandI didn't understandI didn't understand
