Where we start is where we endWe step out sweetly, nothing plannedAlong by the river we feed bread to the swansAnd then over the footbridge to the woods beyondWe walk ourselves weary, you and IThere's just this momentI light a campfire away from the pathWe lie in the bluebells, a woodpecker laughsTime passes slowly our hearts entwinedAll of the dark times left behindThe day is doneThe sun sinks lowWe fold up the blanket, it's time to goWe walk ourselves weary, arm in armBack through the twilightHome againWe waltz in the moonlight and the embers glowSo much behind usStill far to go
