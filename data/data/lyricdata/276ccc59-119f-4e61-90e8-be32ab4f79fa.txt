It was one hundred degrees as we sat beneath a willow treeWhose tears didn't care, they just hung in the airAnd refused to fall, to fall-all-all-allAnd I knew I'd made a horrible callAnd now the state line felt like the Berlin WallAnd there was no doubt about which side I was on, mmhmmm'Cause I built you a home in my heartWith rotten wood and it decayed from the start'Cause you can't find nothin' at allIf there was nothin' there all alongNo, you can't find nothin' at allIf there was nothin' there all alongI braved treacherous streetsAnd kids strung out on homemade speedAnd we shared a bed in which I could not sleepAt all, woohoo, woohoo-oo-oo-oo'Cause at night the sun and the treeMade the skyline look like crooked teethIn the mouth of a man who was devouring us bothYou're so cute when you're slurring your speechBut they're closing the bar and they want us to leaveAnd you can't find nothin' at allIf there was nothin' there all alongNo, you can't find nothin' at allIf there was nothin' there all alongI'm a war of head versus heartAnd it's always this wayMy head is weakMy heart always speaksBefore I know what it will sayAnd you can't find nothin' at allIf there was nothin' there all alongNo, you can't find nothin' at allIf there was nothin' there all alongNo you can't findAnd you can't find nothin' at all,If there was nothin' there all along.There were churches, theme parks and malls,But there was nothin' there all along
