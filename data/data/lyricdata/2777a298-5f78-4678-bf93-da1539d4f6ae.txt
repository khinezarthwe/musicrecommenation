In the middle of the summer I'm not sleeping Cold wind Blowing In the middle of the night they Try to find me But I'm still Driving If you're going to San Francisco Lay some flowers On the Gravestone There's music on a station And I'm just listening To cold wind Whistling And if they ever find me Tell the papers Cold wind Cold wind Cold Cold wind blowing Cold wind blowing Hey hey hey Something ain't right Something ain't right And if they ever find me Tell the papers Cold wind Cold wind Cold cold wind blowing Cold wind blowing Cold wind blowing Cold wind blowing Cold wind blowing
