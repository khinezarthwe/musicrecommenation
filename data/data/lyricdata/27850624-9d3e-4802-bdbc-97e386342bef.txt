My love becomes a mange dyeing autumn in its leavesWhen it broke me in the branch where my antlers come to feedAnd I swam a hundred days in the bosom of this filthCarry on this drought as I tighten my beltThis deceit has no armsBended will, take what's yoursThis deceit has no armsBended will, take what's yoursCalling me, she's calling meThis it may have come to falterWe have become these pleadsIn a field of balding marble where the medicine awaitsThe hourglass pokes at the ribs of my cageAt half rations I'm finished, at half rations the minutesAll that happens was given coil and embraceThis deceit has no armsBended will, take what's yoursThis deceit has no armsBended will, take what's yoursCalling me, she's calling meThis it may have come to falterWe have become these pleadsThis deceit has no armsBended will, take what's yoursThis deceit has no armsBended will, take what's yoursCalling me, she's calling meThis it may have come to falterWe have become these pleads
