Tired like the beggar with the cold inside his bonesLooking for the pleasure that he knew was so far goneSo far goneI took a turn to myselfAnd I was surprised, cause I saw everyone who ever I had lovedI felt a whole lot better after thatPeople look at us and they think were doing finePeople look at us cause they see us all the timeAll the timeBut they never take to usWe've been in this town so long we may as well be deadSo long as people turn their headsAnd cross the street whenever we walk on bySomeone told the truth when it really mattered mostThe beauty of the moment is the beauty sadly lostSadly lostSo I went around to your houseOver tea and gin we talked about the things we readIn Luke and John the things he saidAnd now it's morning we are the sleepyheads
