(Chorus)If I never feel you in my arms againIf I never feel your tender kiss againIf I never hear "I love you" now and thenWill I never make love to you once again?Please understand... if love endsThen I promise you, I promise you thatThat I shall never breathe again(Breathe again, breathe again)That I shall never breathe againAnd I can't stop thinking aboutAbout the way things used to beAnd I can't stop thinking aboutAbout the love that you made to meAnd I can't get you out of my headHow in the world will I beginTo let you walk right out my lifeAnd blow my heart away?And I can't stop caring aboutAbout the apple of my eyeAnd I can't stop doing withoutWithout the center of my lifeAnd I can't get you out of my headAnd I know I can't pretendThat I won't die if you decideYou won't see me again(Chorus)And I can't stop thinking aboutAbout the way my life would beNo, I can't stop thinking aboutHow could you love me then leave?And I can't get you out of my mindGod knows how hard I've triedAnd if you walk right out my lifeGod knows I'd surely dieAnd I can't stop doing withoutWithout the wailing of my heartNo, I can't stop doing withoutFor I would surely fall apartAnd I can't get you out of my mindAnd I know I can't deny itAnd I would die if you decideYou won't see me again(Chorus)
