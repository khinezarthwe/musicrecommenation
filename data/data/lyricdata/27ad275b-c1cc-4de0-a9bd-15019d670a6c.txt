In the cold misty morning Gleaming rays awake the dawn Here I stand - a stranger in this land Does your conscience betray you? Falling from grace - feel the Sun on my face Does desire still hold true? Mystified by her beauty - does the hunter pity his prey? Under starless skies all Love must die, and fade away Take my hand - Divine or Damned - Make a stand Seize the day Yours or mine - Damned or Divine Draw the line - come what may... Looking down from Ethereal Skies Silent crystalline tears I cry For all must say their last goodbye - to Paradise My yearning is silenced by angelic skin of white? Love conquers all, though heavens fall this fateful night Yours or mine - Damned or Divine Draw the line - serpentine... Love is a tragedy All that I have, all that I'll ever need is right here inside Let the winds of freedom be my guide Looking down from Ethereal Skies Silent crystalline tears I cry For all must say their last goodbye - to Paradise Looking down from Ethereal Skies Silent crystalline tears I cry For all must say their last goodbye - to Paradise Say goodbye, goodbye...so I've cheated and I've lied Been the victim of foolish pride And I've begged and I've crawled And I've battled it and bled for it all So I'll savor the downfall.... of Paradise Looking down from Ethereal Skies Silent crystalline tears I cry For all must say their last goodbye - to Paradise Looking down from Ethereal Skies Silent crystalline tears I cry For all must say their last goodbye - to Paradise Looking down from Ethereal Skies Silent crystalline tears I cry For all must say their last goodbye - to Paradise
