In the cold misty morningGleaming rays awake the dawnHere I stand - a stranger in this landDoes your conscience betray you?Falling from grace - feel the Sun on my faceDoes desire still hold true?Mystified by her beauty - does the hunter pity his prey?Under starless skies all Love must die, and fade awayTake my hand - Divine or Damned - Make a standSeize the dayYours or mine - Damned or DivineDraw the line - come what may...Looking down from Ethereal SkiesSilent crystalline tears I cryFor all must say their last goodbye - to ParadiseMy yearning is silenced by angelic skin of white?Love conquers all, though heavens fall this fateful nightYours or mine - Damned or DivineDraw the line - serpentine...Love is a tragedyAll that I have, all that I'll ever need is right here insideLet the winds of freedom be my guideLooking down from Ethereal SkiesSilent crystalline tears I cryFor all must say their last goodbye - to ParadiseLooking down from Ethereal SkiesSilent crystalline tears I cryFor all must say their last goodbye - to ParadiseSay goodbye, goodbye...so I've cheated and I've liedBeen the victim of foolish prideAnd I've begged and I've crawledAnd I've battled it and bled for it allSo I'll savor the downfall.... of ParadiseLooking down from Ethereal SkiesSilent crystalline tears I cryFor all must say their last goodbye - to ParadiseLooking down from Ethereal SkiesSilent crystalline tears I cryFor all must say their last goodbye - to ParadiseLooking down from Ethereal SkiesSilent crystalline tears I cryFor all must say their last goodbye - to Paradise
