I read the news today, oh boyAbout a lucky man who made the gradeAnd though the news was rather sadWell, I just had to laughI saw the photographHe blew his mind out in a carHe didn't notice that the lights had changedA crowd of people stood and staredThey'd seen his face beforeNobody was really sure if he was from the House of LordsI saw a film today, oh boyThe English army had just won the warA crowd of people turned awayBut I just had to lookHaving read the bookI'd love to turn you on()Woke up, fell out of bedDragged a comb across my headFound my way downstairs and drank a cupAnd looking up, I noticed I was late()Found my coat and grabbed my hatMade the bus in seconds flatFound my way upstairs and had a smokeAnd somebody spoke and I went into a dreamAh, ah ah ahAh ah ah, ah ah ahAhAh, ah ah ah, ah ah ahI read the news today, oh boyFour thousand holes in Blackburn, LancashireAnd though the holes were rather smallThey had to count them allNow they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert HallI'd love to turn you on
