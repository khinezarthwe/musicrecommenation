Who are these people? Where do they come from? Are they some extra-terrestrial breed of super fool? What was is not For fuck's sake let it go! The past is deadthis is now, And it's all gone like that. Can't you see you were beat? And every time you repeatyour firm belief You're only digging yourselfdeeper downthe trenches we left behind If only the strong survivehow the hell is it you're still here? Your ignorance only exeededby your complete lack of human skills So slow Oh slower still The paradox in your claims toa force of will Can't you see you were beat? And every time you repeatyour firm belief You're only digging yourselfdeeper downthe trenches we left behind Mirror mirror on the wall Who's the biggest fuck up of all? It's getting ridiculousand we're all supposed toplay along. We're all potential for the bank,and we don't bleed nodifferent shade of red. All my life I've been lonelyfor no good reason All we have is this.
