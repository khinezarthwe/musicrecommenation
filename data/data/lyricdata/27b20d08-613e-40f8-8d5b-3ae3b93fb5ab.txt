Who are these people?Where do they come from?Are they some extra-terrestrial breed of super fool?What was is notFor fuck's sake let it go!The past is deadthis is now,And it's all gone like that.Can't you see you were beat?And every time you repeatyour firm beliefYou're only digging yourselfdeeper downthe trenches we left behindIf only the strong survivehow the hell is it you're still here?Your ignorance only exeededby your complete lack of human skillsSo slowOh slower stillThe paradox in your claims toa force of willCan't you see you were beat?And every time you repeatyour firm beliefYou're only digging yourselfdeeper downthe trenches we left behindMirror mirror on the wallWho's the biggest fuck up of all?It's getting ridiculousand we're all supposed toplay along.We're all potential for the bank,and we don't bleed nodifferent shade of red.All my life I've been lonelyfor no good reasonAll we have is this.
