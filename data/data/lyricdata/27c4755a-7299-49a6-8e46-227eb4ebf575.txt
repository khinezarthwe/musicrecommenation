A flask, I drink of sober tea while relay cameras monitor meAnd the buzz surrounds, it does (buzz surrounds, buzz surrounds)Closed eyed, sky wide open, unlimited girl, unlimited sighElsewhere, indefinitely far away, magnifies and deepensReady to sing, my sixth sense peacefully placed on my breathAnd listening (keeps me from my hurt), my ears know that my eyes are closed (perish thoughts like contraband)I train myself in martial arts as advertisedI reinforce my softened parts as advertisedSee through me, little glazed lane a world in myselfReady to sing, my sixth sense peacefully placed on my breath (flickering I roam)And listening, my ears know that my eyes are closedReady to sing, my sixth sense peacefully placed on my breath (flickering I roam)And listening, my ears know that my eyes are closedI see to bolts, put keys to locks, no boat are rocked, I'm free to roamOn dummy screens and magazinesClosed eyed, sky wide open, unlimited girl, unlimited sighTo think that I lay next to you wasting time when I could doA simple job in strip lights, a flask, I drink a sober tea'Till daylight sends me home flickering I roamDaydreaming admiring being quietly open the worldI hear the time of the starry sky turning over at midnightSee through me, little glazed lane, a world in myselfDaydreaming admiring being quietly open the worldI hear the time of the starry sky turning over at midnight
