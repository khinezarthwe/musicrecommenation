Daydreamer, sitting on the seatSoaking up the sun, he is a real loverMaking up the pastAnd feeling up his girl like he's never felt a figure beforeA jaw dropperLooks good when he walksHe's the subject of their talkHe would be hard to chaseBut good to catchAnd he could change the world with his hands behind his backOhYou can find him sitting on your doorstepWaiting for the surpriseIt will feel like he's been there for hoursAnd you can tell that he'll be there for lifeDaydreamer, with eyes that make you meltHe lends his coat for shelter plus he's there for youWhen he shouldn't beBut he stays all the same, waits for you, then sees you throughThere's no way I could describe himWhat I'll say is, just what I'm hoping forBut I will find him sitting on my doorstepWaiting for the surpriseHe will feel like he's been there for hoursAnd I can tell that he'll be there for lifeAnd I can tell that he'll be there for life
