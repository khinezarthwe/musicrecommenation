And the angel of the lord led meInto the belly of the holy motherA chamber black as pitchBut I felt no fear, only comfort,For I was as a child in the wombAnd she bade me"Peer through yonder portalWhich looked upon the heavens,And behold! a mournin' angel"She ascended slowly from far beyond the horizon,Her light like a heavenly finger pointing the wayAnd on yonder wall she traced for me a pathWhich led me five directions, eight winters to east,And behold!As my feet landed firmlyUpon the vital winter of the second scoreThere appeared before me a heavenly starA holy virgin, the bringer of life and breathAnd she spoke unto me saying"Fear not the movement of the heavens above or the earth belowFor change is what we are, my child.Righteous are thoseWho look up and sway with the wind,Who look down and dance with the shifting of the soil,Who swim with the movement of the tidesWho seek the truth around themAnd discover that we are,And have always been, in paradise.The reflections of heaven on earth."Amen!'And she spoke again saying"Know, my child,That there is no devil seekin'To cause guilt in the hearts to men.No evil, save blind faith, ignorance,And the desire for the unpreparedTo blame others for the devastationLeft in the wake of changeChange, my childChange is in the heavensChange is on this earthChange is all around usAnd if weAre reflections of the divineWe must roll with these changes,For we are these changes.Eyes wide open,We must look uponThe heavens as a mirror.Wide awake, aware, deeply breathingAnd when the ship comes down, my child,You will be there,A true and holy survivorTo inherit the kingdom of God.You will rise above the grumbles of the unpreparedTo greet the new day,To drink from the sweet fruit of the vine,The water of life, the blood of the risen Christ, my child.""Go now, son,Tell them all.The ignorant, the blind paw of dogma,Blinded by faith, the doubters, the nay sayers.Tell them all, child,They cannot seeThe kingdom of God,They cannot see paradiseUnfold before themThey cannot drinkFrom the chaliceWhich holds the blood of Christ,The water of life,Until they get right with Jesus.Until they get right with Jesus.It's always gonna beSour grapes with you, boy,Until you get right with Jesus.Amen!"
