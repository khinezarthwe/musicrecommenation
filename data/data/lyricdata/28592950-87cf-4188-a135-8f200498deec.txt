Do I disappoint you in just being humanAnd not one of the elements that you can light your cigar onWhy does it always have to be fireWhy does it always have to be brimstoneDesireCool this body downDo I disappoint you in just being lonelyAnd not one of the elements that you can call your one and onlyWhy does it always have to be waterWhy does it always have to be holy wineDestructionOf all mankindAnd do I disappoint youDo I disappoint you in just being like youTired of being the reason the road has a shoulderAnd it could be argued why they all return to the orderWhy does it always have to be chaosWhy does it always have to be wanderlustSensationalI'm gonna smash your bloody skull inBaby you know you can't see insideNo baby no you can't see my soulDo I disappoint youDo I disappoint you
