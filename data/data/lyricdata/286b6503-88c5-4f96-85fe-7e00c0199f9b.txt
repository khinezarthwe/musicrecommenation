Last stop for a resolution End of the line, is it confusion? So go Go and see what's there for you Nothing new; nothing new for you to use I've got no new act to amuse you I've got no desire to use you, you know But anything that I could do Would never be good enough for you If you can't help it, then just Leave it alone (leave it alone) Leave it alone Yeah, just forget it It's really easy I believe I'll forget it too Still, you're keeping me around' Til I finally drag us both down Pulling feathers out your hat Yes, I believe that's where it's at You belong tagging along And I belong in the zoo Ah Ah Ah ah Ooh So I wait for confirmation that you're never gonna use your starting gun Unless he's me, it sounds like being him just wasn't that much fun Anything that I could do Would never be Good enough for you If you can't help it, then just Leave it alone (leave it alone) Leave me alone (leave me alone) Yeah, just forget it It's really easy, I'll just forget it too Coast to coast (coast to coast) Coast to coast (coast to coast) I'll do what I can so you can be what you do Coast to coast (coast to coast) Coast to coast (coast to coast) I'll do everything I can so you can be what you do Coast to coast Coast to coast Circuit-rider comes every fifth Sunday Oh my lord, I fell asleep one day Anything that I could do Is there anything that I could do That someone doesn't do for you? (that someone didn't do for you) That someone didn't do for you? (that someone doesn't do for you) That I've already done for you?( Background poetry is excerpts from Exile in Paradise's Tourmaline by Nelson Gary)
