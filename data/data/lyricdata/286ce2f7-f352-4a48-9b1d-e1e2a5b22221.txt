We might kissWhen we are aloneWhen nobody's watchin'We might take it homeWe might make outWhen nobody's thereIt's not that we're scaredIt's just that it's delicateSo why'd you fill my sorrowsWith the words you've borrowedFrom the only place you've known?And why'd you sing hallelujahIf it means nothin' to ya?Why'd you sing with me at all?We might liveLike never beforeWhen there's nothin' to giveWell, how can we ask for more?We might make loveIn some sacred placeThat look on your faceIs delicateSo why'd you fill my sorrowWith the words you've borrowedFrom the only place that you've known?And why'd you sing hallelujahIf it means nothin' to ya?Why'd you sing with me at all?Why'd you fill my sorrowWith the words you've borrowedFrom the only place that you've known?And why'd you sing hallelujahIf it means nothin' to you?Why'd you sing with me at all?
