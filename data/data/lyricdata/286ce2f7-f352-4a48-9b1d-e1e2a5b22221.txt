We might kiss When we are alone When nobody's watchin' We might take it home We might make out When nobody's there It's not that we're scared It's just that it's delicate So why'd you fill my sorrows With the words you've borrowed From the only place you've known? And why'd you sing hallelujah If it means nothin' to ya? Why'd you sing with me at all? We might live Like never before When there's nothin' to give Well, how can we ask for more? We might make love In some sacred place That look on your face Is delicate So why'd you fill my sorrow With the words you've borrowed From the only place that you've known? And why'd you sing hallelujah If it means nothin' to ya? Why'd you sing with me at all? Why'd you fill my sorrow With the words you've borrowed From the only place that you've known? And why'd you sing hallelujah If it means nothin' to you? Why'd you sing with me at all?
