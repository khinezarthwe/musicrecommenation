Cain got a milk-eyed mule from the auction, Abel got a telephoneAnd even the last of their blue-eyed babies knowThat the burning man is the color of the end of dayAnd how every tongue that gets bit always has another word to sayCain bought a blade from some witch at the window, Abel bought a bag of weedAnd even the last of their brown-eyed babies seeThat the cartoon king has a tattoo of a bleeding heartThere ain't a penthouse Christian wants the pain of the scab but they all want the scarHow every mouth sings of what it's without so we all sing of loveAnd how it ain't one dog who's good at fucking and denying who he's thinking ofCain heard a cat tumble limp off the rooftop, Abel heard his papa prayAnd even the last of the black-eyed babies sayThat every saint has a chair you can borrow and a church to sellThat the wind blows cold across the back of the master and the kitchen helpThere's a big pile of innocent bones still holding up the garden wallAnd it was always the broken hand we learned to lean on after allHow God knows if Christ came back he would find us in a poker gameAfter finding out the drinks were all free but they won't let you out the door again
