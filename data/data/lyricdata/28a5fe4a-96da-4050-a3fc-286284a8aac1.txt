Somewhere down past Roosterspur bridgePerhaps just a trick of the lightI thought I heard the sweetest guitarWas it a rock and roll JesusSometimes I think, I think I understandThe fear in the boy, the fire in the manSometimes I watch the wonder in your eyesThat and you leaving I have memorizedThat and you leaving I have memorizedDrove all night through Sliding Rock FallsThinking I'd find something that we'd lostCan't remember when you stopped laughingOr when I stopped wanting to winSometimes I think, I think I understandThe fear in the boy, the fire in the manSometimes I watch the wonder in your eyesThat and you leaving I have memorizedDo you even see me now?Do you think of us still?Do I always read things inBefore a day's deliveranceOn Roosterspur bridge?Sometimes I think, I think I understandThe fear in the boy, the fire in the manSometimes I watch the wonder in your eyesThat and you leaving I have memorizedThat and you leavingThat and you leaving I have memorized
