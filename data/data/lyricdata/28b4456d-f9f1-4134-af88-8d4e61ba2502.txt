Arrive at seven the place feels goodNo time to call you todayEncores till eleven then Chinese foodBack to the hotel againI call your number the line ain't freeI like to tell you come to meA night without you seems like a lost dreamLove I can't tell you how I feelAlways somewhereMiss you where I've beenI'll be back to love you againAlways somewhereMiss you where I've beenI'll be back to love you againAnother morning another placeThe only day off is far awayBut every city has seen me in the endAnd brings me to you againAlways somewhereMiss you where I've beenI'll be back to love you again
