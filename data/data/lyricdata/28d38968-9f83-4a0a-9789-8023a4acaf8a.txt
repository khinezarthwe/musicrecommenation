I heard the sound of voices in the nightSpellbound there was someone callingI looked around no one was in sightPulled down and I kept on fallingI've seen this place beforeAnd you were standing by my sideI've seen your face before tonightMaybe I just seeWhat I wanted to beI know it's a mysteryDo you remember meOn the street of dreamsRunning through my memoryOn the street of dreamsThere you stood a distant memorySo good like we never partedSaid to myself I knew you'd set me freeAnd here we are right back where we startedSomething's come over meAnd I don't know what to feelMaybe this fantasy is realNow I know I seeWhat I wanted to beBut it's still a mysteryDo you remember meOn the street of dreamsRunning through my memoryOn the street of dreamsYou're in every face I seeOn the street of dreamsSomething's come over meAnd I don't know what to feelMaybe this fantasy is realNow I know I seeWhat I wanted to beBut it's still a mysteryDo you remember meOn the street of dreamsRunning through my memoryOn the street of dreamsOn the street of dreamsI know you have always beenOn the street of dreamsWill we ever meet again my friendOn the street of dreamsDo you know just what it means to beOn the street of dreamsNever know just who you'll seeOn the street of dreamsYou can be who you want to be ohOn the street of dreamsI can hear you calling meOn the street of dreamsI can feel you haunting meHaunting me
