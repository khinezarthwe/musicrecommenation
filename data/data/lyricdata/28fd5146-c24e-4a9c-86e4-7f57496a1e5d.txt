When I first came to this islandThat I called by my own nameI was happy in this fortressIn my exile I remainedBut the hours grew so emptyAnd the ocean sent her wavesIn the figure of a womanShe pulled me out to seaWhen you come down to take me homeSend my soul awayWhen you come round you'll make me wholeSend my soul awayOn the altar of a sunriseWas a wedding in the wavesAnd inside her shone a young lightFrom her labor I was savedThough I've traveled long in darknessIn her harvest I'm embracedWhen you come down to take me homeSend my soul awayWhen you come round you'll make me wholeSend my soul awayNow the spires and the gablesGrow in orchards to the skyAnd the blessings on my tableMultiply and divideWhen you come down to take me homeSend my soul awayYeah, when you come round you'll make me wholeSend my soul awayYeah, when you come down to take me homeWhen you come round you'll make me wholeYeah, when you come down to take me homeSend my soul awaySend my soul awaySend my soul awaySend my soul away
