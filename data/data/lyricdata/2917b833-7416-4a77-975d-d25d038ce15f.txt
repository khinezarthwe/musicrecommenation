It's just what all young lovers do It's just what all young lovers do I noticed you You stood out like a sore thumb The most beautiful sore thumb I'd ever seen I took you out And showed you a good time We danced all night, and I waited 'til the time was right When I was almost sick on you Echo, echo, my mind It's just what all young lovers do Do you recall The night that we first met? And how I burnt your dress with my cigarette I don't know why But I played this game for you Cos I'm guessing it's just what all young lovers do You say That it's never wrong, never right Never wrong, never right Echo, echo, my mind Never wrong, never right, never wrong, never right Never wrong, never right, never wrong, never right Never wrong, never right, never wrong, never right Never wrong, never right, never wrong, never right So echo on Echo on Echo on Echo It's just what all young lovers do It's just what all young lovers do It's just what all young lovers do It's just what all young lovers do
