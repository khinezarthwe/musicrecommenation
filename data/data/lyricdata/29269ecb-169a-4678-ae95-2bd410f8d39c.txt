One! Two! Three! Four!One! Two! Three! Four!One! Two! Three! Four!Any more tears for the birthing pool?Bear this child directly into miseryKiss him in the face with no lips and no tongueBut with your little, middle, index and ring fingersSinging "I see songs in shapes and coloursLike nuclear physics or pottery ovensFluid lines that soar like towersPatterns reformed just like child actors"Plunge your hand, rip out my spineReplace it with a UV lightSo I can be the beacon of hope that you'd always expectedThese constant broken heartbeats sound like breakbeatsLooping round and round to meYou know he's so much more like Spiderman than you will ever, ever beSo stick with your instinctsStick with the imprintsWith the hieroglyphics that the fan clubs sent usAnd roll with the toppersJust like steady choppersBat it with your eyelidsAnd lose it with your staticGo b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b - honeeeeey!I'm taking far too many chancesOn these less than idealistic romancesPlunge your hand, rip out my spineReplace it with a UV lightSo I can be the beacon of hope that you'd always expectedThese constant broken heartbeats sound like breakbeatsLooping round and round to meYou know he's so much more like Spiderman than you will ever, ever be.
