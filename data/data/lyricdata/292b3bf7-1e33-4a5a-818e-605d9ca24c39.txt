Sweet little words made for silenceNot talkYoung heart for loveNot heartacheDark hair for catching the windNot to veil the sight of a cold worldKiss while your lips are still redWhile he's still silentRest while bosom is still untouched, unveiledHold another hand while the hand's still without a toolDrown into eyes while they're still blindLove while the night still hides the withering dawnFirst day of love never comes backA passionate hour's never a wasted oneThe violin, the poet's hand,Every thawing heart plays your theme with careKiss while your lips are still redWhile he's still silentRest while bosom is still untouched, unveiledHold another hand while the hand's still without a toolDrown into eyes while they're still blindLove while the night still hides the withering dawn
