Daniel, when I first saw youI knew that you had a flame in your heartAnd under wild blue skyMarble movie skyI found a home in your eyesWe would never be apartAnd when the fires cameThe smell of cinders and rainPerfumed almost everythingWe laughed and laughed and laughedAnd in the golden blueCar you took me toThe darkest place you knewAnd you set fire to my heartWhen I run in the dark(Daniel)Into a place that’s lost(Daniel)Under a sheet of rain in my heart(Daniel)I dream of home…But in the goodbye bedWith my arms around your neckInto our mouths the tears creptJust kids in the eye of the stormAnd as my house spun roundMy dreams pulled me from the groundForever to search for the flameFor home againFor home againWhen I run in the dark(Daniel)Into a place that’s lost(Daniel)Under a sheet of rain in my heart(Daniel)I dream of home…When I run in the dark(Daniel)Into a place that’s lost(Daniel)Under a sheet of rain in my heart(Daniel)I dream of home…
