Of all the things I've believed inI just want to get it over withTears form behind my eyesBut I do not cryCounting the days that pass me byI've been searching deep down in my soulWords that I'm hearing are starting to get oldFeels like I'm starting it all over againThe last three years were just pretendAnd I saidGoodbye to youGoodbye to everything I thought I knewYou were the one I lovedThe one thing that I tried to hold on toI still get lost in your eyesAnd it seems that I can't live a day without youClosing my eyes and you chase my thoughts awayTo a place where I am blinded by the lightBut it's not rightGoodbye to youGoodbye to everything I thought I knewYou were the one I lovedThe one thing that I tried to hold on toAnd it hurts to want everythingAnd nothing at the same timeI want what's yours and I want what's mineI want youBut I'm not giving in this timeGoodbye to youGoodbye to everything I thought I knewYou were the one I lovedThe one thing that I tried to hold on toGoodbye to youGoodbye to everything I thought I knewYou were the one I lovedThe one thing that I tried to hold on toThe one thing that I tried to hold on toThe one thing that I tried to hold on toThe one thing that I tried to hold on toAnd when the stars fallI will lie awakeYou're my shooting star
