As if it was so easy to go (to go) A walk to something special before (before) And everything you want is to know (to know) How is waiting for me anymore? The days are getting longer now In futuristic silence Does anybody anyhow Care about anything? Now if you've lived in shadows before and you entered the light So now, what do you say? Am I not always be wanting this? (x4) Now if it was so hard not to return (to return) Why shouldn't I come back? A few things in my head raise a concern (a concern) It's because I lost track of you Having disappeared from the past Waiting on the other side Funny in a certain way You found me, Here.. In the night So please hit me now and put the light on, yeah Am I not always be wanting this? (x8)
