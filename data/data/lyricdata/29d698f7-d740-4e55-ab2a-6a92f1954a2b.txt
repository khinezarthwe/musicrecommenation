Traveling north, traveling north to find youTrain wheels beating, the wind in my eyesDon't even know what I'll find when I get to youCall out your name love don't be surprisedIt's so many miles and so long since I've left youDon't even know what I'll find when I get to youBut suddenly now, I know where I belongIt's many hundred miles and it won't be longNothing at all in my head to say to youOnly the beat of the train I'm onNothing I've learn, all my life, on the way to youOne day our love was over and goneIt's so many miles and so long since I've met youDon't even know what I'll say when I get to youBut suddenly now, I know where I belongIt's many hundred miles and it won't be longWhat will I do if there's someone there with youMaybe someone you've always knownHow do I know I can come and give to youLove with no warning and find you aloneIt's so many miles and so long since I've met youDon't even know what I'll find when I get to youBut suddenly now, I know where I belongIt's many hundred miles and it won't be longIt won't be longIt won't be longIt won't be long
