You know I really like itI know I'll always be hereYou know it makes my heart beatYou know I'm happy up hereWorld, what you got for me?Just bring it onWhat's it gonna be?Are you ready for it?People, what you got for me?Just bring it onWhat's it gonna be?I'm ready for itYou know I really like itI know I'll always be hereWhatever you do, whatever you sayNothing can push the feeling awayIt's here in my heart and it's here in my headI feel like I'm part of a book I've readAnd every page and every paperSeems to be part of human natureSending me back down on memory laneMy favorite record is playing againYou know I really like itI know I'll always be hereYou know it makes my heart beat
