Don't you wanna go for a ride Just keep your hands inside And make the most out of life Now don't you take it for granted Life is like a mean machine It made a mess outta me It left me caught between Like an angry dream I was stranded I was stranded And I'm steady but I'm starting to shake And I don't know how much more I can take This is it now Everybody get down This is all I can take This is how a heart breaks You take a hit now you feel it break down Make you stay wide awake This is how a heart breaks Don't you wanna go for a ride Down to the other side Feels so good you could cry Now won't you do what I told you I remember when you used to be shy Yeah, once we were so fine You and I why you gotta make it so hard on me Yeah its hard on me And I'm sorry but it's not a mistake And I'm running but you're getting away This is it now Everybody get down This is all I can take This is how a heart breaks You take a hit now you feel it break down Make you stay wide awake This is how a heart breaks This is how a heart breaks You're not the best thing that I knew Never was never cared too much For all this hanging around It's just the same thing all the time Never get what I want Never get too close to the end of the line You're just the same thing that I knew Back before the time when i was running from you This is it now Everybody get down This is all I can take This is how a heart breaks You take a hit now you feel it break down Make you stay wide awake This is how a heart breaks Yeah this is it now Everybody get down This is all I can take This is how a heart breaks You take a hit now you feel it break down Make you stay wide awake This is how a heart breaks (ooooo)(ah yeah)(ooooo) This is how a heart breaks (ooooo)(ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah)( This is it yeah yeah this is it oooh) This is how a heart breaks(ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah)( Cant take it, Cant take it, Cant take it, Cant take it) This is how a heart breaks( Cant take it no more)(ooooo)(ah yeah ah yeah ah yeah) This is how a heart breaks( I cant take it, I cant take it, I cant take it, oh no) This is how a heart breaks ( O O O H) This is how a heart breaks T H I S I S H O W A H E A R T B R E A K S!
