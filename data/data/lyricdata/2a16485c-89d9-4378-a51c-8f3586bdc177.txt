Treat me wrong, honey, I don't careYou never liked me much anywayYou told me meet you about half past eightYou said you'd kill me if I was late, ClaireOh, ClaireYou drove me up and down the streetYou used me up like gasolineI still remember everything you saidThat's the reason had to say away from ClaireOh, ClaireOh, Claire(You know what?That's funny you know, I don't miss you at all.Not even a little, you bitch.I still love you.)I still remember seeing you sleepAll twisted up inside the sheetsAnd I still remember everything you saidEvery time I hear your name, ClaireOh, ClaireOh, ClaireClaire
