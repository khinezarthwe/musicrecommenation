Got a big plan, his mind set, maybe it's right At the right place, and right time, maybe tonight And the whisper or handshake sending a sign Wanna make out and kiss hard, wait, never mind Late night in passing, mention it flip To her best friend, it's no thing, maybe it slipped But the slip turns to terror and the crush to like Then she walked in, he froze up, leave it to fright It's cute in a way 'tilyou cannot speak And you leave to have a cigarette And knees get weak Escape was just a nod and a casual wave Obsessed about it heavy for the next two days It's only just a crush, it'll go away It's just like all the others, it'll go away Or maybe this is danger, and you just don't know You pray it all away, but it continues to grow I want to hold you close Skin pressed against me tight Lie still, close your eyes, girl So lovely, it feels so right I want to hold you close Soft breath, beating heart As I whisper in your ear I want to fucking tear you apart Then he walked up and told her, thinking, maybe it'd pass And they talked and looked away a lot, doing the dance Her hand brushed up against his, she left it there Told him how she felt, and then they locked in a stare They took a step back, thought about it, what should they do?' Cause there's always repercussions when you're dating in school But their lips met, and reservations started to pass Whether this was just an evening or a thing that would last Either way he wanted her, and this was bad Wanted to do things to her, it was making him crazy Now a little crush turned into a like And now he wants to grab her by the hair and tell her I want to hold you close Skin pressed against me tight Lie still, close your eyes, girl So lovely, it feels so right I want to hold you close Soft breast, beating heart As I whisper in your ear I want to fucking tear you apart I want to hold you close Skin pressed against me tight Lie still, close your eyes, girl So lovely, it feels so right I want to hold you close Soft breast, beating heart As I whisper in your ear I want to fucking tear you apart I want to hold you close Skin pressed against me tight Lie still, close your eyes, girl So lovely, it feels so right I want to hold you close Soft breast, beating heart As I whisper in your ear I want to fucking tear you apart
