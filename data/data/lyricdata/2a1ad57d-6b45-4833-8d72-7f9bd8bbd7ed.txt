I was walking down the street with my chains tied up to my feetI leaned instead of jiggie with the sidewalkNow this street tells the same old boring tale that has failed in so many ways of lifeTo trust its stories you've got to be dull as themAnd all the love I've got in hereYou've just killed, you peasants didn't even careThe love I had in store you raped for moreAnd all the dreams I had in here you've just stolenYou peasants didn't even careBut the dreams I had for her you cannot touch, my golden hand'Cause it's guarded by your promisesI met her in a crowded room where the bookshelves help you and knowledge takes your handI watched her beauty from an armchairI said "Hey girl have you seen that film with those kids in New York in the eightiesOh, you have - Well, can I watch it with you anyway?"And all the love I've got in hereYou've just killed, you peasants didn't even careThe love I had in store you raped for moreAnd all the dreams I had in here you've just stolenYou peasants didn't even careBut the dreams I had for her you cannot touch, my golden hand'Cause it's guarded by your promisesCongratulation Mr. Major you savior, betrayer, you stinking master of trustsHow does it feel to ride all those horses?You cannot touch our hearts when we're in bloomI assume that we'll win over the heads againWe conceal none, you'll feel none, that's what I promiseAnd all the love we've got in store, you can't kill you peasants! We won it allAnd the love I have for her you cannot touch, my golden hand'Cause it's guarded by your filthy promisesAnd all the love I've got in hereYou've just killed you peasants didn't even careThe love I had in store you raped for moreAnd all the dreams I had in here you've just stolenYou peasants didn't even careBut the dreams I had for her you cannot touch, my golden hand'Cause it's guarded by your promises, yeah, yeah, yeahHoney I love you, like the summer fallsAnd the winter crawlsYou're above and beyond meHoney I love you, like the summer fallsAnd the winter crawlsYou're above and beyond meHoney I love you, like the summer fallsAnd the winter crawlsYou're above and beyond me
