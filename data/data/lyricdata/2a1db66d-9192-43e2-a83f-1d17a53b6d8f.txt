Closed off from love, I didn't need the painOnce or twice was enough and it was all in vainTime starts to pass, before you know it you're frozenBut something happened for the very first time with youMy heart melted to the ground, found something trueAnd everyone's looking 'round, thinking I'm going crazyBut I don't care what they say, I'm in love with youThey try to pull me away, but they don't know the truthMy heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closingYou cut me open and IKeep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding loveI keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding loveKeep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding loveYou cut me openTrying hard not to hear, but they talk so loudTheir piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubtYet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling, ooh yeahBut nothing's greater than the risk that comes with your embraceAnd in this world of loneliness, I see your faceYet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazyMaybe, maybeBut I don't care what they say, I'm in love with youThey try to pull me away, but they don't know the truthMy heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closingYou cut me open and IKeep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding loveI keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding loveKeep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding loveYou cut me openAnd it's draining all of meThough they find it hard to believeI'll be wearing these scars for everyone to seeI don't care what they say, I'm in love with youThey try to pull me away, but they don't know the truthMy heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closingOoh, you cut me open and IKeep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding loveI keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding loveKeep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding loveOh, you cut me open and IKeep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding loveI keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding loveKeep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding loveOoh, you cut me open and IKeep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love, oh
