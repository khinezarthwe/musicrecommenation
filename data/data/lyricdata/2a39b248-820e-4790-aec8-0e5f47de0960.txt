Saw you from the urchin's side, from under the boat Saw you making knots, saw you get the rope The boy appearing on the deck and making it lurch And bubble of your interests ready to burst He whistles and he runs Saw you in distraction, a sleeping slow despair Rehearsing interaction, he wasn't even there A creature is a creature though you wish you were the wind The boat will not stop moving if you tie him up until the end He whistles and he runs so hold him fast Breathe the burn, you want to let it last He might succumb to what you haven't seen He has a keen eye for what you used to be When the cadaverous mob saves its doors for the dead men You cannot leave
