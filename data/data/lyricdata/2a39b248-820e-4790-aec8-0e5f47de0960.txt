Saw you from the urchin's side, from under the boatSaw you making knots, saw you get the ropeThe boy appearing on the deck and making it lurchAnd bubble of your interests ready to burstHe whistles and he runsSaw you in distraction, a sleeping slow despairRehearsing interaction, he wasn't even thereA creature is a creature though you wish you were the windThe boat will not stop moving if you tie him up until the endHe whistles and he runs so hold him fastBreathe the burn, you want to let it lastHe might succumb to what you haven't seenHe has a keen eye for what you used to beWhen the cadaverous mob saves its doors for the dead menYou cannot leave
