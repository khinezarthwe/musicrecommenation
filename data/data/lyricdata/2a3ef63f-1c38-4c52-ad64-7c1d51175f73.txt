Don't be afraid, open your mouth and say Say what your soul sings to you Your mind can never change unless you ask it to Lovingly rearrange, the thoughts that make you blue The things that bring you down only do harm to you And so make your choice joy, the joy belongs to you And when you do you'll find the one you love is you You'll find you love you Don't be ashamed, no, to open your heart and pray Say what your soul sings to you So no longer pretend that you can't feel it near That tickle on your hand, that tingle in your ear Oh, ask it anything because it loves you, dear It's your most precious king if only you can hear And when you do you'll find the one you need is you You'll find you love you
