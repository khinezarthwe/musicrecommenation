Don't be afraid, open your mouth and saySay what your soul sings to youYour mind can never change unless you ask it toLovingly rearrange, the thoughts that make you blueThe things that bring you down only do harm to youAnd so make your choice joy, the joy belongs to youAnd when you do you'll find the one you love is youYou'll find you love youDon't be ashamed, no, to open your heart and praySay what your soul sings to youSo no longer pretend that you can't feel it nearThat tickle on your hand, that tingle in your earOh, ask it anything because it loves you, dearIt's your most precious king if only you can hearAnd when you do you'll find the one you need is youYou'll find you love you
