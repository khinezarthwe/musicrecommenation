We get some rules to followThat and this, these and thoseNo one knowsWe get these pills to swallowHow they stick in your throatTastes like goldOh, what you do to meNo one knowsAnd I realize you're mineIndeed, a fool am IAnd I realize you're mineIndeed, a fool am I, II journey through the desertOf the mind with no hopeI followI drift along the oceanDead lifeboats in the sunAnd come undonePleasantly caving inI come undoneAnd I realize you're mineIndeed, a fool am IAnd I realize you're mineIndeed, a fool am I, IHeaven smiles above meWhat a gift here belowBut no one knowsThe gift that you give to meNo one knows
