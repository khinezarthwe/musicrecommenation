This is the year where hope fails youThe test subjects run the experimentAnd the bastard you know is the hero you hateBut cohesion is possible if we tryThere's no reason; there's no lessonNo time like the presentTell me right now, what have you got to lose?What have you got to lose, except your soul?Who's with us?I fight for the unconventionalMy right and it's unconditionalI can only be as real as I canThe disadvantage is I never knew the planThis isn't just a way to be a martyrI can't walk alone any longerI fight for the ones who can't fightAnd if I lose, at least I triedWe, we are the new diabolicWe, we are the bitter bucolicIf I have to give my life, you can have itWe, we are the pulse of the maggotsI won't be the inconsequentialI won't be the wasted potentialI can make it as severe as I canUntil you realize you'll never take a standIt isn't just a one-sided versionWe've dealt with a manic subversionI won't let the truth be pervertedAnd I won't leave another victim desertedWe, we are the new diabolicWe, we are the bitter bucolicIf I have to give my life, you can have itWe, we are the pulse of the maggotsDo you understand?YesSay it again, say it againWe won't dieWe fight till no one can fight usWe live and no one can stop usWe pull, but we're pushed too farAnd the advantage is, the bottom line isWe never had to fight in the first placeWe only had to spit back in their faceWe won't walk alone any longerWhat doesn't kill us only makes us stronger
