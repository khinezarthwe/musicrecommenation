I walk the streets of Japan till I get lost'Cause it doesn't remind me of anythingWith a graveyard tan carrying a crossYeah, it doesn't remind me of anythingI like studying faces in a parking lot'Cause it doesn't remind me of anythingI like driving backwards in the fog'Cause it doesn't remind me of anythingThe things that I've loved, the things that I've lostThings I've held sacred, that I've droppedI won't lie no more, you can betI don't want to learn what I'll need to forgetI like gypsy moths and radio talk'Cause it doesn't remind me of anythingI like gospel music and canned applause'Cause it doesn't remind me of anythingI like colorful clothing in the sun'Cause it doesn't remind me of anythingI like hammering nails and speaking in tongues'Cause it doesn't remind me of anythingThe things that I've loved, the things that I've lostThings I've held sacred, that I've droppedI won't lie no more, you can betI don't want to learn what I'll need to forgetBend and shape meI love the way you areSlow and sweetlyLike never beforeCalm and sleepingWe won't stir up the pastSo discretelyWe won't look backThe things that I've loved, the things that I've lostThings I've held sacred, that I've droppedI won't lie no more, you can betI don't want to learn what I'll need to forgetI like throwing my voice and breaking guitars'Cause it doesn't remind me of anythingI like playing in the sand, what's mine is oursIf it doesn't remind me of anything
