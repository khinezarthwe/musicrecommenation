I walk the streets of Japan till I get lost' Cause it doesn't remind me of anything With a graveyard tan carrying a cross Yeah, it doesn't remind me of anything I like studying faces in a parking lot' Cause it doesn't remind me of anything I like driving backwards in the fog' Cause it doesn't remind me of anything The things that I've loved, the things that I've lost Things I've held sacred, that I've dropped I won't lie no more, you can bet I don't want to learn what I'll need to forget I like gypsy moths and radio talk' Cause it doesn't remind me of anything I like gospel music and canned applause' Cause it doesn't remind me of anything I like colorful clothing in the sun' Cause it doesn't remind me of anything I like hammering nails and speaking in tongues' Cause it doesn't remind me of anything The things that I've loved, the things that I've lost Things I've held sacred, that I've dropped I won't lie no more, you can bet I don't want to learn what I'll need to forget Bend and shape me I love the way you are Slow and sweetly Like never before Calm and sleeping We won't stir up the past So discretely We won't look back The things that I've loved, the things that I've lost Things I've held sacred, that I've dropped I won't lie no more, you can bet I don't want to learn what I'll need to forget I like throwing my voice and breaking guitars' Cause it doesn't remind me of anything I like playing in the sand, what's mine is ours If it doesn't remind me of anything
