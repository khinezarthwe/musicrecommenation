II still rememberHow you looked that afternoonThere was only youYou said it's just like a full moonBlood beats faster in our veinsWe left our trousers by the canalAnd our fingers, they almost touchedYou should have asked me for itI would have been braveYou should have asked me for itHow could I say no?And our love could have soaredOver playgrounds and rooftopsEvery park bench screams your nameI kept your tieI'd have gone wherever you wantedI still rememberAnd on that teachers' training day(And on that teachers' training day)We wrote our names on every train(We wrote our names on every train)Laughed at the people off to work(Laughed at the people off to work)So monochrome and so lukewarm(So monochrome and so lukewarm)And I could see our days are becoming nightI could feel your heart beat across the grassWe should have run, I would go with you anywhereI should have kissed you by the waterYou should have asked me for itI would have been braveYou should have asked me for itHow could I say no?And our love could have soaredOver playgrounds and rooftopsEvery park bench screams your nameI kept your tieI would let you if you asked meI still remember
