I I still remember How you looked that afternoon There was only you You said it's just like a full moon Blood beats faster in our veins We left our trousers by the canal And our fingers, they almost touched You should have asked me for it I would have been brave You should have asked me for it How could I say no? And our love could have soared Over playgrounds and rooftops Every park bench screams your name I kept your tie I'd have gone wherever you wanted I still remember And on that teachers' training day( And on that teachers' training day) We wrote our names on every train( We wrote our names on every train) Laughed at the people off to work( Laughed at the people off to work) So monochrome and so lukewarm( So monochrome and so lukewarm) And I could see our days are becoming night I could feel your heart beat across the grass We should have run, I would go with you anywhere I should have kissed you by the water You should have asked me for it I would have been brave You should have asked me for it How could I say no? And our love could have soared Over playgrounds and rooftops Every park bench screams your name I kept your tie I would let you if you asked me I still remember
