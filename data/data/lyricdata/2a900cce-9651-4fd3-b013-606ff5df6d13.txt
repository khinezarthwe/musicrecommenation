We sailed away on a winter's day With fate as malleable as clay But ships are fallible, I say And the nautical, like all things, fades And I can recall our caravel A little wicker beetle shell With four fine masts and lateen sails Its bearings on Cair Paravel Oh my love, oh it was a funny little thing To be the ones to have seen The sight of bridges and balloons Makes calm canaries irritable And they caw and claw all afternoon Catenaries and dirigibles Brace and buoy the living room A loom of metals, warp, woof, wimble And a thimble's worth of milky moon Can touch hearts larger than a thimble Oh my love, oh it was a funny little thing To be the ones to have seen Oh my love, oh it was a funny little thing It was a funny, funny little thing
