We sailed away on a winter's dayWith fate as malleable as clayBut ships are fallible, I sayAnd the nautical, like all things, fadesAnd I can recall our caravelA little wicker beetle shellWith four fine masts and lateen sailsIts bearings on Cair ParavelOh my love, oh it was a funny little thingTo be the ones to have seenThe sight of bridges and balloonsMakes calm canaries irritableAnd they caw and claw all afternoonCatenaries and dirigiblesBrace and buoy the living roomA loom of metals, warp, woof, wimbleAnd a thimble's worth of milky moonCan touch hearts larger than a thimbleOh my love, oh it was a funny little thingTo be the ones to have seenOh my love, oh it was a funny little thingIt was a funny, funny little thing
