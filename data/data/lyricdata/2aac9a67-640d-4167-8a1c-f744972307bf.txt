A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farmA boy filled with wanderlust who really meant no harmHe changed his clothes and shined his boots and combed his dark hair downAnd his mother cried as he walked outDon't take your guns to town sonLeave your guns at home BillDon't take your guns to townHe laughed and kissed his mom and said, "your Billy Joe's a man"I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody canBut I wouldn't shoot without a cause; I'd gun nobody down"But she cried again as he rode awayDon't take your guns to town sonLeave your guns at home BillDon't take your guns to townHe sang a song as on he rode his guns hung at his hipsHe rode into a cattle town, a smile upon his lipsHe stopped and walked into a bar and laid his money downBut his mother's words echoed againDon't take your guns to town sonLeave your guns at home BillDon't take your guns to townHe drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking handAnd tried to tell himself he had become a manA dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him downAnd he heard again his mothers wordsDon't take your guns to town sonLeave your guns at home BillDon't take your guns to townFilled with rage then Billy Joe reached for his gun to drawBut the stranger drew his gun and fired before he even sawAs Billy Joe fell to the floor, the crowd all gathered 'roundAnd wondered at his final wordsDon't take your guns to town sonLeave your guns at home BillDon't take your guns to town
