There's a lesson I have learntIf you play with fire you will get burntHell hath no furyLike woman scornedI'll tell you my storyMake you wish you never, wish you...Wish you never never, wish you never been bornI may never learn, never knowI may live and learn but never knowI may crash and burn, oh noI may take my turnIf you love her, then tell her you love her andYou could be kissing her soonIf you need her, oh, tell her you need her andYou won't be missing her soonOh, but for a love to be trueIt must come from her tooIt's a lesson hard learnedIf you play with fire you will get burntHell hath no fury... (?)Oh, I may never learn, you never knowI may live and learn, never knowI may crash and burn, oh noI may take my turnIf you love her, then tell her you love her andYou could be kissing her soonIf you need her, oh, tell her you need her andYou won't be missing her soon
