Most people live their livesLooking straight aheadMoving in a straight lineEyes fixed on their golden dreamsWell thats how it seemsFrom the moment i met youI was counting back the daysReelin in the years nowYou turned my life upside downYou span me aroundYou drove me to the point of no returnEvery day since you left meI’ve been stumbling in the darkI lost my directionI don’t know which way to turnI’ll never learnSuicidal if i goAll my friends tell me soBut they don’t know what i knowAnd i know it’s the only wayCan’t live another dayYou drove me to the point of no return
