Most people live their lives Looking straight ahead Moving in a straight line Eyes fixed on their golden dreams Well thats how it seems From the moment i met you I was counting back the days Reelin in the years now You turned my life upside down You span me around You drove me to the point of no return Every day since you left me I’ve been stumbling in the dark I lost my direction I don’t know which way to turn I’ll never learn Suicidal if i go All my friends tell me so But they don’t know what i know And i know it’s the only way Can’t live another day You drove me to the point of no return
