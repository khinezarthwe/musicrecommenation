So this is the new yearAnd I don't feel any differentThe clanking of crystalExplosions off in the distanceIn the distanceSo this is the new yearAnd I have no resolutionIt's self-assigned penanceFor problems with easy solutionsSo everybody put your best suit or dress onLet's make believe that we are wealthy for just this onceLighting firecrackers off on the front lawnAs thirty dialogues bleed into oneI wish the world was flat like the old daysAnd I could travel just by folding the mapNo more airplanes or speed-trains or freewaysThere'd be no distance that could hold us backThere'd be no distance that could hold us backThere'd be no distance that could hold us backSo this is the new yearSo this is the new yearSo this is the new yearSo this is the new year
