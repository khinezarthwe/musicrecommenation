The distant echo -of faraway voices boarding faraway trainsTo take them home tothe ones that they love and who love them foreverThe glazed, dirty steps - repeat my own and reflect my thoughtsCold and uninviting, partially nakedExcept for toffee wrapers and this morning's papersMr. Jones got run downHeadlines of death and sorrow - they tell of tomorrowMadmen on the rampageAnd I'm down in the tube station at midnightI fumble for change - and pull out the QueenSmiling, beguilingI put in the money and pull out a plumBehind meWhispers in the shadows - gruff blazing voicesHating, waiting"Hey boy" they shout "have you got any money?"And I said "I've a little money and a take away curry,I'm on my way home to my wife.She'll be lining up the cutlery,You know she's expecting mePolishing the glasses and pulling out the cork"And I'm down in the tube station at midnightI first felt a fist, and then a kickI could now smell their breathThey smelt of pubs and Wormwood ScrubsAnd too many right wing meetingsMy life swam around meIt took a look and drowned me in its own existenceThe smell of brown leatherIt blended in with the weatherIt filled my eyes, ears, nose and mouthIt blocked all my sensesCouldn't see, hear, speak any longerAnd I'm down in the tube station at midnightI said I was down in the tube station at midnightThe last thing that I sawAs I lay there on the floorWas "Jesus Saves" painted by an atheist nutterAnd a British Rail poster read "Have an Awayday - a cheap holiday -Do it today!"I glanced back on my lifeAnd thought about my wife'Cause they took the keys - and she'll think it's meAnd I'm down in the tube station at midnightThe wine will be flat and the curry's gone coldI'm down in the tube station at midnightDon't want to go down in a tube station at midnight
