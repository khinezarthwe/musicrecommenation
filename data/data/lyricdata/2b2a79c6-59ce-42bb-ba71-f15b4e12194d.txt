In the year of my declineSucking freezies in the rainDriving twisted to the suburbsAnd then driving back againSeventeen and half aliveHeadlights illuminate the schoolInhale the powder from the science class, yeahNearly dying felt so coolYour face is all that hasn't changedYou're reassembled just like meBut when I reach to touch your handYou stroke mine gentlyAll I want is one more chanceTo be young and wild and freeAll I want is one more chance to show youYou were right for meYou were right for meI'm back in gym and it's the sameAs my name tag floats awayI had six too many drinks last night, yesAnd that's why I made you stayPlus I always wanted youYou liked to rock it in your carYou said you didn't understand meBecause I always tried to see too farWell, Tainted Love's too fast to dance toSo let's leave them all behindThey hated us with everything they hadAnd we hated them in kindAll I want is one more chanceTo be young and wild and freeAll I want is one more chance to show youYou were right for meAll I want is one more chanceTo be young and wild and freeAll I want is one more chance to show youYou were right for meReunion, reunion...Reunion, reunion...Reunion, reunion...Reunion, reunion...
