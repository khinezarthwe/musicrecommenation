So here you are in Hoxton two years on Since you left that little no where that you're from First few weeks you stayed with your ex,same old arguments but without the sex.  Now you're renting down the road its not so cheapEvery weekend police stayed in the street wirey looking kids looked up eyes downwe then biked to the arctic crown  Now they're sqauring up"What phone you got bruv"? Yeah they're gonna give you griefYou still get home in one piece.  In the bar your mates spark(?) celebrity But you're not fussed by the gay guy on CBBC Limos fury hen nights to the west endthe night is dragging its heals till the end  now he's in your face."Got any drugs on you mate"?You get out for some peacestill get home by our feet see now your home,crashing out in your coat Jet lagged from the night bus/bars?Planning your escape  No point in trying to act all hardas the kids take the piss when you walk pastNo sane place left to go your mates aren't in the start and yes I'll growNow you're tearing up just need one night offGet out of this in one peace and come home for some sleep  Now you're homecrash out in your coat jet lagged from the night busand plan your escape.
