I think I'll go home and mull this overBefore I cram it down my throatAt long last it's crashed, its colossal massHas broken up into bits in my moatRip the mattress off the floorWalk the cramps off, go meander in the coldHail to your dark skin, hiding the fact you're dead againUnderneath the power lines seeking shadeFar above our headsAre the icy heights that contain all reasonIt's a luscious mix of words and tricksThat let us bet when you know we should've foldOn rocks I dreamt of where we'd steppedAnd of the whole mess of roads we're now onHold your glass up, hold it inNever betray the way you've always known it isOne day I'll be wondering how I got so old just wondering howNever got cold wearing nothing in the snowThis is way beyondMy remote concern of being condescendingAll these squawking birds won't quitBuilding nothing, laying bricksHold your glass up, hold it inNever betray the way you've always known it isOne day I'll be wondering how I got so old just wondering howNever got cold wearing nothing in the snowThis is way beyondMy remote concern of being condescendingAll these squawking birds won't quitBuilding nothing, laying bricks
