Funeral held for the depression of manHolds the key to his own deathEntering a tomb of a corpse yet conceivedTighten the tourniquet around your neckSifting away the debris of hated lifeCold touch of death begins to chill your spineSeeking life beyond your perishmentRepeating words echoing through your mindChanting lines of blind witcheryTo save yourself from extinctionWanting to die is your reason to liveNew life born from the oppressedTaste your blood as it trickles through the airAnother casualty beyond the shadows you fallLosing ground, the fate you feel it draws nearFatality, reality, you await the final call
