When I see your smile Tears run down my face I can't replace And now that I'm stronger I've figured out How this world turns cold and it breaks through my soul And I know I'll find deep inside me I can be the one I will never let you fall (let you fall) I'll stand up with you forever I'll be there for you through it all (through it all) Even if saving you sends me to heaven It's okay It's okay It's okay Seasons are changing And waves are crashing and stars are falling All for us Days grow longer and nights grow shorter I can show you I'll be the one I will never let you fall (let you fall) I'll stand up with you forever I'll be there for you through it all (through it all) Even if saving you sends me to heaven' Cause you're my, you're my My true love, my whole world Please don't throw that away' Cause I'm here for you Please don't walk away And please tell me you'll stay Yeah....whoa....stay....whoa....ohh.... Use me as you will Pull my strings just for a thrill And I know I'll be ok Though my skies are turning grey (grey....) I will never let you fall I'll stand up with you forever I'll be there for you through it all Even if saving you sends me to heaven I will never let you fall I'll stand up with you forever I'll be there for you through it all Even if saving you sends me to heaven( I will never let you fall...)
