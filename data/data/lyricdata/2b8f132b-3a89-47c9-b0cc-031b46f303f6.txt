You know you've got a lot to learnYou feel it but your heart won't burnThe fear is running every nerveYour turning to the ones you've hurtNothing ever satisfiesYou're screaming but your tongue's still tiedStarving but your love won't feedNothing ever sets you freeYou know you've got a long way downYou'll feel it when you hit the groundIt's not what you wantedIt's not what you came here forThis place just leaves you coldWhere nothing mattersPinned inside the walls of soundReaching but your hands are boundCrying but your love's so sweetYour singing but your heart still weepsAnd no one ever seems to careFeels like she walks on airIt's not what you wantedIt's not what you came here forThis place just leaves you coldWhere nothing mattersI can't wait for time to save usAnd I can't break your fall forever'Cause you always takeYou always take too muchYou always takeYou always take too muchIt's not what you wantedIt's not what you came here forThis place just leaves you coldWhere nothing mattersIt's not what you wantedIt's not what you came here forThis place just leaves you cold, where nothing matters
