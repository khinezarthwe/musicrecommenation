Go to now after picking the glass off the groundGo to now after shaking the thing for a soundDo we see what the clock makes you do?But I won't let this happen to youIn a town where I lost every shirt on the fenceGo to now, I am bleeding a trail through the lensWhen I see what I now know is youI was caught in the eye as you camePulled by my name, I'm fallin' throughTraveling at godspeed over the hills and trailsI have refused my call pushin' my lazy cellsInto the blue flame, I want to crash here right nowThe hourglass spills its sand, if only to punish youFor listenin' too long to one songListenin' too long to one songSing me Spanish technoListenin' too long to one songListenin' too long to one songSing me Spanish technoGo to now after wiring the thing to explodeWired for sound, wide awake here for days in a rowNow we see what the engine can doAnd I won't let this happen to youI won't let this happen to youTraveling at godspeed over the hills and trailsI have refused my call pushin' my lazy cellsInto the blue flame, I want to crash here right nowThe hourglass spills its sand, if only to punish youFor listenin' too long to one songListenin' too long to one songSing me Spanish technoListenin' too long to one songListenin' too long to one songSing me Spanish techno
