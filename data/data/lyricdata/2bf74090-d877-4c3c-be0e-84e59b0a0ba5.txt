I fell in love with a bad bad manAnd ever since I met him I've been sad sad sadI'm a jailbird to your musicA criminal in your prayerI watch you when you sleepEven when you're not thereRainbows wept color all over the streetWhen you went away, maybe one day we'll meetLipstick I'd wear for one million yearsJust to stop your eyes from falling them tearsI fell in love with a bad bad manAnd every since I met him I've been sad sad sadI'm a jailbird to your musicI'm a criminal in your prayerI watch you in your sleepEven when you're not thereRainbows wept color all over the streetWhen you went away, maybe one day we'll meetOne day we'll meetOne day we'll meetOne dayYes, maybe weWill meet
