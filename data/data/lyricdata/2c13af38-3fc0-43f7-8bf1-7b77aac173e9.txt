I went away to see an old friend of mineHis sister came over, she was out of her mindShe said Jesus had a twin who knew nothing about sinShe was laughing like crazy at the trouble I'm inHer light eyes were dancingShe is insaneHer brother says she's just a bitch with a golden chainShe keeps coming closer, saying "I can feel it in my bonesSchizophrenia is taking me home"My future is staticIt's already had itI could tuck you inAnd we can talk about itI had a dreamAnd it split the sceneBut I got a hunchIt's coming back to me
