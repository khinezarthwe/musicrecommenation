Starry nightsCity lightsComing down over meSkyscrapersStargazers in my headAre we? We areAre we? We are the waiting unknownThis dirty townWas burning down in my dreamsLost and foundCity bound in my dreamsAnd screamingAre we? We areAre we? We are the waitingAnd screamingAre we? We areAre we? We are the waitingForget-me-notsSecond thoughtsLive in isolationHeads or tailsFairytales in my mindAre we? We areAre we? We are the waiting unknownThe rage and loveThe story of my lifeThe Jesus of Suburbia is a lieAnd screamingAre we? We areAre we? We are the waitingAnd screamingAre we? We areAre we? We are the waiting unknownAre we? We areAre we? We are the waitingAnd screamingAre we? We areAre we? We are the waiting unknownAre we? We areAre we? We are the waiting unknown
