I don't know how to live through this hellWoken up, I'm still locked in this shellFrozen soul, frozen down to the coreBreak the ice, I can't take anymoreFreezing, can't move at allScreaming, can't hear my callI am dying to liveCry out, "I'm trapped under ice"Crystallized, as I lay here and restEyes of glass stare directly at deathFrom deep sleep I have broken awayNo one knows, no one hears what I sayFreezing, can't move at allScreaming, can't hear my callI am dying to liveCry out, "I'm trapped under ice"Scream from my soulFate mystifiedHell forever moreScream from my soulFate mystifiedHell forever moreNo release from my cryonic stateWhat is this? I've been stricken by fateWrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break freeHand of doom has a tight grip on meFreezing, can't move at allScreaming, can't hear my callI am dying to liveCry out, "I'm trapped under ice"Freezing, can't move at allScreaming, can't hear my callI am dying to liveCry out, "I'm trapped under ice"
