As I walk onThrough this wicked worldSearching for light in the darkness of insanityI ask myselfIs all hope lostIs there only pain and hatred and miseryAnd each time I feel like this insideThere's one thing I wanna knowWhat's so funny 'bout peace love and understandingWhat's so funny 'bout peace love and understandingAs I walk onThrough troubled timesMy spirit gets so down-hearted sometimesSo where are the strongAnd who are the trustedAnd where is the harmony, sweet harmony'Cause each time I feel it slipping awayJust makes me wanna cryWhat's so funny 'bout peace love and understandingWhat's so funny 'bout peace love and understandingSo where are the strongAnd who are the trustedAnd where is the harmony, sweet harmony'Cause each time I feel it slipping awayJust makes me wanna cryWhat's so funny 'bout peace love and understandingWhat's so funny 'bout peace love and understandingWhat's so funny 'bout peace love and understanding
