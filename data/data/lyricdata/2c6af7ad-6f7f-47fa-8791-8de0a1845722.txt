I shout and call for rejoicing I hear the sound of angel wings Escape us as we close the ring And into the fire we will fall Our desire, our flame, our call So be it, once for all And you are the dream and I am the lie I am the Devil and you are my disguise I'm all the pain you always tried to keep inside Love in chains We break free There is a time For you and me Not today Not tomorrow But one day our sorrow Shall go away All our being is spellbound A black magic hellhound Let us have another round for our love Many hours we shall wait But it will never be to late In life or death we'll intergrate one day Trough rain and stormy weather Shall always be together Together here forever Forever...
