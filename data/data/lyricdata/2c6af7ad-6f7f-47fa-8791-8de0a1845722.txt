I shout and call for rejoicingI hear the sound of angel wingsEscape us as we close the ringAnd into the fire we will fallOur desire, our flame, our callSo be it, once for allAnd you are the dream and I am the lieI am the Devil and you are my disguiseI'm all the pain you always tried to keep insideLove in chainsWe break freeThere is a timeFor you and meNot todayNot tomorrowBut one day our sorrowShall go awayAll our being is spellboundA black magic hellhoundLet us have another round for our loveMany hours we shall waitBut it will never be to lateIn life or death we'll intergrate one dayTrough rain and stormy weatherShall always be togetherTogether here foreverForever...
