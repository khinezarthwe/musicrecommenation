I was born in a town where the rivers flow freeOn a January night when the cold winds freezeI got an Irish name and an injuryA blessing and a curse cast down on meAin't nobody got the blues like meAin't nobody got the blues like meIt was a blood red sky on the morning tideThere was a cold wind blowin' when I left that nightAnd the warning bells rang, all right, all rightShoulda stayed home with you that nightAin't nobody played the fool like IAin't nobody played the fool like IThings got bad and things got worseHalf like a blessing, half like a curseSeems a blessing's so hard to see sometimesGot a little clearer 'bout dusk last nightAin't nobody got a blessing like mineAin't nobody got a blessing like mineIt's a red sky night and I'm doin' all rightRed sky night and I'm doin' just fine
