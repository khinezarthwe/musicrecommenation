Lover, I don’t play to win but for the thrill until I’m spentI threw flowers in your face on my sister's wedding dayYou showed up with a black eye looking to go start a fightPlayboys under the mattress like I wouldn't noticeWhat do I share?What do I keep from all the strangers who sleep where I sleep?Desperate don't look good on you neither does your virtueGood souls have borne better sons, better souls borne worse onesWhat do I share?What do I keep from all the strangers who sleep where I sleep?You show up with a black eye looking to finish a fightAnd lover I don’t play to win but for the thrill until I’m spent
