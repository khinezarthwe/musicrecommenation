Do you recognize meHere on this sleeper trainAnd do you feel the painGrowing into the night,MaryAnd i can feel the tasteOf your birthday cakeRemember how it wasTo hold you into my arms,Mary.It wasn't thereThe summer lights aroundI wasn't thereHis hand upon my kneesAnd we're goneAcross the sunny streetsAnd we're goneThe day you died,MaryAnd we go faster nowTogether throught the fieldsHere on this sleeper trainAnd i can touch your face, Mary.The precious things we've doneHidden under my skinI let you sleep a whileI leet you sleepA while, Mary.It was thereThe summer lights aroundI was thereHis hand upon my kneesAnd we're goneAcross the sunny streets.And we're goneThe day you died, Mary
