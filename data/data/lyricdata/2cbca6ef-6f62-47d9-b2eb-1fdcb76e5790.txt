Koreema knows Just what it is she does And it can't be hard for her To get a buzz Down in the street below You can hear the drunken prophet sing" I know what's on your mind, my boy' Cause I can see, oh, everything Lead pipes are fortune made Well, take a tip from me Climb up to her window ledge Or you'll forever be Just walking under ladders As the people round you hear you crying please As the people round you hear you crying please"" Lead pipes are fortune made Well, take a tip from me Climb up to her window ledge Or you'll forever be Just walking under ladders As the people round you hear you crying please As the people round you hear you crying please" Who really knows Just what it is she does It cant be hard for her To get a buzz The rapture of vertigo And letting go Me myself, I was never sure Was it the liquor or was it my soul?
