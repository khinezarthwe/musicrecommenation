Maybe I hang around hereA little more than I shouldWe both know I've got somewhere else to goBut I got something to tell youThat I never thought I wouldBut I believe you really ought to knowI love youI honestly love youYou don't have to answerI see it in your eyesMaybe it was better left unsaidBut this is pure and simpleAnd you must realizeThat it's coming from my heart and not my headI love youI honestly love youI'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortableI'm not trying to make you anything at allBut this feeling doesn't come along every dayAnd you shouldn't blow the chanceWhen you got the chance to sayI love youI love youI honestly love youIf we both were born in another place and timeThis moment might be ending in a kissBut there you are with yours and here I am with mineSo I guess we'll just be leaving it like thisI love youI honestly love youI honestly love you
