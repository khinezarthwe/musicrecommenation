I found a switchYou turned it onI hit the ditchYou carried onI was so nearNow you're so farAre you quite sureJust who you areO IIIIIO you could chose a friend but you don't seem to have the timeO IIIIII wonder if you ever get to say what's on your mindO take a little time, take a little timeI love it when you callI love it when you callI love it when you callBut you never call at allSo what's the complication it's only conversationI love it when you callBut you never call at allRemember me, I used to be the best time buddyThat you couldn't wait to seeBut getting old, it takes its tollAnd hearts getting broken lead to people growing coldO IIIIIII'm flipping with a coin that's got a tail on either sideO IIIIIII'm gonna be the one who makes you stop and realiseYou could have it allWe should have it allI love it when you callI love it when you callI love it when you callBut you never call at allSo what's the complication it's only conversationI love it when you callBut you never call at allYea I wonder where you beenYea I wonder who you seenAnd I hope you find your trainWhen you do I really hope it's all it seemsI love it when you callI love it when you callI love it when you callBut you never call at allSo what's the complication it's only conversationI love it when you callBut you never call at all
