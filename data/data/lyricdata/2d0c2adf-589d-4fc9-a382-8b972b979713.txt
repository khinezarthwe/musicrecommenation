I fall over and over and over Over, oh, I want you I get in, I get in, I get in You're the only one I'm into You and me Fit so tight I go lower and lower and lower Lower, living easy I don't know how long I got Till it's over You and me Fit so tight Can you do it again? Do it again Do it again Can you do it again? All the way, all the way, all the way There's nowhere left we can be I'm into what you do But I leave you nowhere You and me Fit so tight All we need Is one more time Can you do it again? Do it again Do it again Can you do it again? Do it again Do it again Can you do it again? Only get to live one life Won't pretend you're only mine Wherever you'll go Wherever you'll find a way So do it again Do it again Do it again Do it again Do it again Do it again
