Friday night I'm going nowhereAll the lights are changing green to redTurning over TV stationsSituations running through my headWell looking back through timeYou know it's clear that I've been blindI've been a foolTo ever open up my heartTo all that jealousy, that bitterness, that ridiculeIf you want itCome and get itCrying out loudThe love that I wasGiving you wasNever in doubtLet go your heartLet go your headAnd feel it nowBabylon, BabylonSaturday I'm running wildAnd all the lights are changing red to greenMoving through the crowds I'm pushingChemicals all rushing in my bloodstreamOnly wish that you were hereYou know I'm seeing it so clearI've been afraidTo show you how I really feelAdmit to some of those bad mistakes I've madeIf you want itCome and get itCrying out loudThe love that I wasGiving you wasNever in doubtLet go your heartLet go your headAnd feel it nowBabylon, BabylonSunday all the lights of LondonShining , Sky is fading red to blueI'm kicking through the Autumn leavesAnd wondering where it is you might be going toTurning back for homeYou know I'm feeling so aloneI can't believeClimbing on the stairI turn around to see you smiling thereIn front of meIf you want itCome and get itCrying out loudThe love that I wasGiving you wasNever in doubtAnd feel it nowLet go your heartLet go your headAnd feel it nowLet go your heartLet go your headAnd feel it nowLet go your heartLet go your headAnd feel it nowLet go your heartLet go your headAnd feel it nowBabylon, Babylon, Babylon
