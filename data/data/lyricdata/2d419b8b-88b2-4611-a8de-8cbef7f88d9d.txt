You should be stronger than meYou been here seven years longer than meDon't you know you supposed to be the manNot pale in comparison to who you think I amYou always wanna talk it through, I don't careI always have to comfort you when I'm thereBut that's what I need you to do, stroke my hair'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joyFeel like a lady, and you my lady boyYou should be stronger than meBut instead you're longer than frozen turkeyWhy'd you always put me in control?All I need is for my man to live up to his roleAlways wanna talk it through, I'm okay,Always have to comfort you every dayBut that's what I need you to do. Are you gay?'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joyFeel like a lady, and you my lady boyHe said,I said,Sounds as if you're reading from some other tired scriptI'm not gonna meet your mother anytimeI just wanna grip your body over minePlease tell me why you think that's a crimeI've forgotten all of young love's joyFeel like a lady, and you my lady boyYou should be stronger than meYou should be stronger than meYou should be stronger than meYou should be stronger than me
