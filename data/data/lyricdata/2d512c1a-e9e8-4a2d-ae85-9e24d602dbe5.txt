A song for the deaf...That is for you...Nobody's coming down the hallNobody echoes in my headBroken reflection, out of luckNobody ever needed herI got what wasI want to take what's leftFor the deafBeautiful senses are goneCanary in a gilded cageSingin'Sweet, soft, and lowI will poison you allCome closer, racing to your turnI got what wasI want to take what's leftNo talk will cureWhat's lost, or save what's leftFor the deafThe blind can go get fuckedLie beside the ditchThis halo round my neckHas torn out every stitchWho are you hidingIs it safe for the deafBeautiful cancerInfiltrate and forgetAnd I saw you comingAnd I heard not a thingA mistake not to listenWhen I knew where you'd beenAnd I got what wasI want to take what's leftNo talk will cureWhat's lost, or save what's leftFor the deaf
