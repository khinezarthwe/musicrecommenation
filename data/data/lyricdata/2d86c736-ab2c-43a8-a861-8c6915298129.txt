Rising with the morning sun, I turn to greet the dawnKnowing I must face another daySleepless night behind me, just a memory of painMy heart has always been a cross to bearLord, I know the sunshine but I feel the tears of rainFalling down to wash my sins awayI'll try hard to remember so I won't be fooled againHey, ain't gonna cry no more todayAll around me, shadows fall though day has just begunI realise I'm on my own againMemories of broken dreams as distant as the sun,Are drifting like an echo in the windLord, I know the sunshine but I feel the tears of rainFalling down to wash my sins awayI'll try hard to remember so I won't be fooled againHey, ain't gonna cry no more todayBabe, I thought about it but it just ain't done goodYou hold my heart and soul within your handAll the time, you're in my mindI never thought you could be so blindMaybe some day I will understandLord, I know the sunshine but I feel the tears of rainFalling down to wash my sins awayI'll try hard to remember so I won't be fooled againHey, ain't gonna cry no more todayNo moreHey, mama you drive me crazy, knowing you're my heart's desireWhy'd you go and hang me up this way?You've given me love, given me loveNow tell me what you were thinking ofWhy'd you go and steal my soul away?Lord, I know the sunshine but I feel the tears of rainFalling down to wash my sins awayI'll try hard to remember so I won't be fooled againHey, ain't gonna cry no more todayI ain't gonna cry no moreLord, I know the sunshine but I feel the tears of rainFalling down to wash my sins awayI'll try hard to remember so I won't be fooled againHey, ain't gonna cry no more todayAin't gonna cry no moreHey, I ain't gonna cry no more today
