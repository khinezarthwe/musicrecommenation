Nobody can tell youThere's only one song worth singin'They may try and sell you'Cause it hangs them upTo see someone like youBut you've got to make your own kind of musicSing your own special songMake your own kind of musicEven if nobody else sings alongYou're gonna be nowhereThe loneliest kind of lonelyIt may be rough goingJust to do your thing's the hardest thing to doBut you've got to make your own kind of musicSing your own special songMake your own kind of musicEven if nobody else sings alongSo if you cannot take my handAnd if you must be going, I will understandYou've got to make your own kind of musicSing your own special songMake your own kind of musicEven if nobody else sings alongYou've got to make your own kind of musicSing your own special songMake your own kind musicEven if nobody else sings along
