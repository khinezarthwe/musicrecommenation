Oh, I'm being followed by a moonshadow Moonshadow, moonshadow Leapin' and hopping' on a moonshadow Moonshadow, moonshadow And if I ever lose my hands Lose my plough, lose my land Yes, if I ever lose my hands Oh if.... I won't have to work no more And if I ever lose my eyes If my colors all run dry, Yes if I ever lose my eyes Oh if.... I won't have to cry no more Oh, I'm being followed by a moonshadow Moonshadow, moonshadow Leapin' and hopping' on a moonshadow Moonshadow, moonshadow And if I ever lose my legs I won't moan, and I wont beg Yes if I ever lose my legs Oh if.... I won't have to walk no more And if I ever lose my mouth All my teeth, north and south Yes if I ever lose my mouth Oh if.... I won't have to talk... Did it take long to find me? I asked the faithful light Did it take long to find me? And are you gonna stay the night? Oh, I'm being followed by a moonshadow Moonshadow, moonshadow Leapin' and hopping' on a moonshadow Moonshadow, moonshadow Moonshadow, moonshadow Moonshadow, moonshadow
