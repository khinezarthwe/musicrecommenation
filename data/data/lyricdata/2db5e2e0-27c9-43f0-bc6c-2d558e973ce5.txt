Yea though we ventured through the valley of the starsYou in all your jewellery and my bleeding heartWho couldn't be together and who could not be apartWe should've jumped out of that airplane after allFlying skyways overhead it wasn't hard to fallAnd I had so many crashes that I couldn't feel at allAnd it feels like I'm seventeen againFeels like I'm seventeen againTime might break you, god forsake you, leave you burnt and bruisedInnocence will teach you what it feels like to be usedThought that you'd done everything, youdidn't have a clueAnd it feels like I'm seventeen againFeels like I'm seventeen againLooking from the outside in some things never changeHey hey I'm a million miles awayFunny how it seems like yesterdayAll those fake celebrities and all those vicious queensAll the stupid papers and the stupid magazinesSweet dreams are made of anything that gets you in the sceneAnd it feels like I'm seventeen againAnd it feels like I'm seventeen againYes it feels like I'm seventeen againSeventeen, seventeen again yeah yeah yeahSweet dreams are made of theseWho am I to disagreeÂ ?I travelled the world and the seven seasEverybody's looking for somehing yeah
