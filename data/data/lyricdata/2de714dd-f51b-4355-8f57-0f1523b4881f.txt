Hey, brother, I miss you so - you knocked on heaven's doorAnd we won't see you anymore - it must be crazy what we're living for'Cause God's stopped keeping you on the ladder of your lifeI call your name with tears in my eyesI don't wanna cry no more - past gave me happiness and painLife is fleeting like a flower from a distanceAfter sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soulI don't wanna cry no more - we're still missing youYou slipped away, I've seen you dying in vainHigh as mountains seem all the problems that I haveBut when I hear your voice far away out of the dark -You just go on and on in the back of my mindI don't wanna cry no more - past gave me happiness and painLife is fleeting like a flower from a distanceAfter sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soulI don't wanna cry no more - we're still missing youSkin and bone won't touch the skyI hope you'll find passage out of the darkTo the other side of the sea and I know that I'll see you againI don't wanna cry no more - past gave me happiness and painLife is fleeting like a flower from a distanceAfter sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soulI don't wanna cry no more - we're still missing you
