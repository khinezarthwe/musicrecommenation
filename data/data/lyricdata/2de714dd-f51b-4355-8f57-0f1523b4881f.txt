Hey, brother, I miss you so - you knocked on heaven's door And we won't see you anymore - it must be crazy what we're living for' Cause God's stopped keeping you on the ladder of your life I call your name with tears in my eyes I don't wanna cry no more - past gave me happiness and pain Life is fleeting like a flower from a distance After sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soul I don't wanna cry no more - we're still missing you You slipped away, I've seen you dying in vain High as mountains seem all the problems that I have But when I hear your voice far away out of the dark - You just go on and on in the back of my mind I don't wanna cry no more - past gave me happiness and pain Life is fleeting like a flower from a distance After sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soul I don't wanna cry no more - we're still missing you Skin and bone won't touch the sky I hope you'll find passage out of the dark To the other side of the sea and I know that I'll see you again I don't wanna cry no more - past gave me happiness and pain Life is fleeting like a flower from a distance After sorrow I pray the Lord to keep your soul I don't wanna cry no more - we're still missing you
