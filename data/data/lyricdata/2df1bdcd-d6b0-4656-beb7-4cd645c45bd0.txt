This is what I thought you said Talking on the phone Just walk away And cry Cause so long The holidays we spent will fade Now that I've been gone Just remember That we met You're still at home Listen to the voice that says alright This is start and not the end tonight You sent an S O S away Reach across the skythrough glowing windows We stare But not at home Times like this you wonder why It's even worth your while Just count the silence These days Until you smile Listen to the voice that says alright This is start and not the end tonight Listen to the voice that says alright This is start and not the end tonight
