This is what I thought you saidTalking on the phoneJust walk awayAnd cryCause so longThe holidays we spent will fadeNow that I've been goneJust rememberThat we metYou're still at homeListen to the voice that says alrightThis is start and not the end tonightYou sent an SOS awayReach across the skythrough glowing windowsWe stareBut not at homeTimes like this you wonder whyIt's even worth your whileJust count the silenceThese daysUntil you smileListen to the voice that says alrightThis is start and not the end tonightListen to the voice that says alrightThis is start and not the end tonight
