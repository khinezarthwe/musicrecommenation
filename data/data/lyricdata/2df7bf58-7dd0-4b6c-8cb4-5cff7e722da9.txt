You kissed me on the forehead, now this kiss is giving me a concussion We were love at first sight, now it's crush, it's crushing I traced your steps through the city of romance lazily I took to the desert with your harshest words and they saved me I'll bail you out again, I've got the readies I'm not a child I know, we're not going steady Your pain's gigantic but it's not as big as your ego Promise not to abandon you, please let me go Now I've been worrying about your feelings, yeah, they were worth protecting They say I'm too kind and sentimental like you could catch affection Oh in your eyes there's a sadness enough to kill the both of us Are those eyes overrated? They make me want to give up on love I'll brace myself for the loneliness Say hello to feelings that I detest This maudlin career has come to an end I don't want to be sad again This maudlin career has come to an end I don't want to be sad again This maudlin career has come to an end I don't want to be sad again This maudlin career has come to an end I don't want to be sad again This maudlin career has come to an end I don't want to be sad again
