You kissed me on the forehead, now this kiss is giving me a concussionWe were love at first sight, now it's crush, it's crushingI traced your steps through the city of romance lazilyI took to the desert with your harshest words and they saved meI'll bail you out again, I've got the readiesI'm not a child I know, we're not going steadyYour pain's gigantic but it's not as big as your egoPromise not to abandon you, please let me goNow I've been worrying about your feelings, yeah, they were worth protectingThey say I'm too kind and sentimental like you could catch affectionOh in your eyes there's a sadness enough to kill the both of usAre those eyes overrated? They make me want to give up on loveI'll brace myself for the lonelinessSay hello to feelings that I detestThis maudlin career has come to an endI don't want to be sad againThis maudlin career has come to an endI don't want to be sad againThis maudlin career has come to an endI don't want to be sad againThis maudlin career has come to an endI don't want to be sad againThis maudlin career has come to an endI don't want to be sad again
