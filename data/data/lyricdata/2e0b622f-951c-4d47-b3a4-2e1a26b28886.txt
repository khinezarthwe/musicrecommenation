One fine day in my odd pastI picked me up a transmissionI turned the fission ignitionWent looking for the broadcasterAnd when I first touched some groundThey simply told me to leaveWas kind of hard to believe'Cause there was no one aroundThis ain't the planet of soundThis ain't the planet of soundThis ain't the planet of soundThis ain't the planet of soundI had a talented wineThat land of classical gasAnd on the planet of glassThey sent me skipping through timeI got to somewhere renownedFor its canals and color of redAnd lots of guys who shook their headsRhythmically to resoundThis ain't the planet of soundThis ain't the planet of soundThis ain't the planet of soundThis ain't the planet of soundThis ain't the planet of sound (This ain't the planet)This ain't no rock and roll town (This ain't the planet)This ain't no fuckin' around (This ain't the planet)This ain't the planet of sound (This ain't the planet)I met a guy in a RoverHe said, "It's one more overIt's just there where you're bound"This ain't the planet of soundThis ain't the planet of sound (This ain't the planet)This ain't the planet of sound (This ain't the planet)This ain't the planet of sound (This ain't the planet)This ain't the planet of sound (This ain't the planet)
