Death comes sweeping through the hallwayLike a lady's dressDeath comes driving down the highwayIn its Sunday bestA fire of unknown originTook my baby awayA fire of unknown originTook my baby awaySwept her up and off my wavelengthSwallowed her upLike the ocean in a fireSo thick and greyA fire of unknown originTook my baby awayA fire of unknown originTook my baby awayDeath comes drivingI can't do nothingDeath goesThere must be somethingThere must be somethingThat remainsThere must be somethingThere must be somethingA fire of unknown originTook my baby awayA fire of unknown originTook my babyTook my baby away
