This place is a prisonThese people aren't your friendsInhaling thrills through twenty dollar billsAnd the tumblers are drained and then floodedAgain and again.There's guards at the onrampsArmed to the teethAnd you may case the groundsFrom the Cascades to Puget SoundBut you are not permitted to leave.I know there's a big world out thereLike the one that I saw on the screenIn my living room late last nightIt was almost too bright to see.And I know that it's not a partyIf it happens every nightPretending there's glamor and candelabraWhen you're drinking by candlelight.And what does it takeTo get a drink in this place?What does it take?How long must I wait?And what does it takeTo get a drink in this place?What does it take?How long must I wait?How long must I wait?
