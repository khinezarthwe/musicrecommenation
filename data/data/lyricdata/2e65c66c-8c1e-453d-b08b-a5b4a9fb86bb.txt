This place is a prison These people aren't your friends Inhaling thrills through twenty dollar bills And the tumblers are drained and then flooded Again and again. There's guards at the onramps Armed to the teeth And you may case the grounds From the Cascades to Puget Sound But you are not permitted to leave. I know there's a big world out there Like the one that I saw on the screen In my living room late last night It was almost too bright to see. And I know that it's not a party If it happens every night Pretending there's glamor and candelabra When you're drinking by candlelight. And what does it take To get a drink in this place? What does it take? How long must I wait? And what does it take To get a drink in this place? What does it take? How long must I wait? How long must I wait?
