I know how to hurtI know how to healI know what to showAnd what to concealI know when to talkAnd I know when to touchNo one ever diedFrom wanting too muchThe world is not enoughBut it is such a perfect place to start, my loveAnd if you're strong enoughTogether we can take the world apart, my lovePeople like usKnow how to surviveThere's no point in livingIf you can't feel aliveWe know when to kissAnd we know when to killIf we can't have it allThen nobody willThe world is not enoughBut it is such a perfect place to start, my loveAnd if you're strong enoughTogether we can take the world apart, my loveI feel safeI feel scaredI feel readyAnd yet unpreparedThe world is not enoughBut it is such a perfect place to start, my loveAnd if you're strong enoughTogether we can take the world apart, my loveThe world is not enoughThe world is not enoughNowhere near enoughThe world is not enough
