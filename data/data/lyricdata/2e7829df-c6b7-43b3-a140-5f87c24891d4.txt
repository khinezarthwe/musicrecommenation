Here we are in the westAnd our cars are glistenin'The bear he roars in the eastBut we ain't listenin'We won't play games in his backyardBut we let him build his wallWe say our God is on our sideHope he's listenin' to us allWhile we talkHe's gettin' dresses, he's lookin' for his thrillsHe's gettin' dresses to killWe got eyes in the starsBut we don't care what they seeWe put a man on the moonWe all see it on t.v.We all protest about his bombsHe hopes we keep it goingAnd while we rest he's marchin' onHis fuse has started glowin'While we talkHe's gettin' dressed, he's lookin' for his thrillsHe's gettin' dressed to killWhat have you got to hide at homeHis arms are stained but never emptyThe things that you think you ownAre only for the fewDon't you think it's time, don't you think it's timeWe got ready, we got readyWe got right on our sideSo our leaders say todayCount the size of the treatWe can slide a different wayOur planes are flyin' in your skyWe know just what they're sayin'You see the writing on the wallYour nerves are tearin', frayin'While we talkHe's gettin' dressed, he's lookin' for his thrillsHe's gettin' dressed to killHe's gettin' dressed, he's lookin' for his thrillsHe's gettin' dressed to kill
