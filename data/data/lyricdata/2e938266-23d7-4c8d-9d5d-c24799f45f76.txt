I saw a friend that I once knew at a funeralHe took the time out to be seenHis eyes kept glancing to the hour hand on the gold watchThat he'd been given by a magazineHe didn't cry when the priest gave the sermonJust pulled up the woollen collar on his fleeceCrossed his arms, gave a sigh, and checked the time againAs he sat inches from the wife of the deceasedHe catches raindrops from his window, it reminds him how we fallFrom the stars back to our cities where we've never felt so smallRaindrops from his window, making puddles in his handsHe sees how quick the water's rising as another raindrop landsHe took a chauffeur-driven car back to his hotelPassing through the city streets where he was bornHe said, "Driver, what's happened to these buildings?They all look rundown and so forlorn"He took a shower in the bathroom of his penthousePut the 'Do not disturb' on his doorWhen the maid came in the morningShe found him shivering on the bedroom floorHe catches raindrops from his window, it reminds him of how we fallFrom the stars back to our cities where we've never felt so smallRaindrops from his window, making puddles in his handsHe sees how quick the water's rising as another raindrop landsHe catches raindrops from his window, it reminds him of how we fallFrom the stars back to our cities where we've never felt so smallRaindrops from his window, making puddles in his handsHe sees how quick the water's rising as another raindrop lands
