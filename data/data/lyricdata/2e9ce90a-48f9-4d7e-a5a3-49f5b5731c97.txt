There I was on a July morningLooking for loveWith the strength of a new day dawningAnd the beautiful sunAt the sound of the first bird singingI was leaving for homeWith the storm and the night behind meAnd a road of my ownWith the day, came the resolutionI'll be looking for youLa-la-la, la, la-la-la, laLa-la-la.I was looking for love in the strangest placesThere wasn't a stone that I left unturnedMust have tried more than a thousand facesBut not one was aware of the fire that burnedIn my heart, in my mind, in my soulLa-la-la, la, la-la-la, laLa-la-la.In my heart, in my mind, in my soulLa-la-la, la, la-la-la, laLa-la-la, la-la-laLa-la-la, la-la-la.There I was on a July morningI was looking for loveWith the strength of a new day dawningAnd the beautiful sunAt the sound of the first bird singingI was leaving for homeWith the storm and the night behind me, yeahAnd a road of my ownWith the day, came the resolutionI'll be looking for youLa-la-la, la, la-la-la, laLa-la-la.
