They said there'll be snow at ChristmasThey said there'll be peace on EarthBut instead it just kept on rainingA veil of tears for the Virgin birthI remember one Christmas morningA winters light and a distant choirAnd the peal of a bell and that Christmas tree smellAnd their eyes full of tinsel and fireThey sold me a dream of ChristmasThey sold me a Silent NightThey told me a fairy story'Till I believed in the IsraeliteAnd I believed in Father ChristmasLooked to the sky with excited eyesThen I woke with a yawn in the first light of dawnAnd I saw him and through his disguiseI wish you a hopeful ChristmasI wish you a brave New YearAll anguish pain and sadnessLeave your heart and let your road be clearThey said there'd be snow at ChristmasThey said there'll be peace on EarthHallelujah, Noel, be it Heaven or HellThe Christmas we get, we deserve
