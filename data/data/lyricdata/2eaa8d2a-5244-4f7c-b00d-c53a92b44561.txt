I met a girl at the Cambel town bar You know the one that plays the guitar' Yes' she said some things that you shouldn't say Wonder if she remembers She was wasted anyway It's the next day Who remembers what No-one knows Everybody's too afraid to talk about it anyway These particular times everyone's out of line It makes no change it's so strange Everybody's walking around so deranged She asked me to play her that song everyone likes She said she'd listen as the day is long and dance shed dance into the night We talked of dreams, romance and excess Something inside of her tells me she climbs to be the best This you have to respect Stuck in her dead in job And yes she said, some things that she should not say She wonders if I remember I was wasted anyway It's the next week We stop and speak Happens all the times It's like a trend and it totally drives me round the bend These particular times Everyone's out of line it makes no change It's strange Everybody's walking around so deranged
