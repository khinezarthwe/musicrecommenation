I met a girl at the Cambel town barYou know the one that plays the guitar'Yes' she said some things that you shouldn't sayWonder if she remembersShe was wasted anywayIt's the next dayWho remembers whatNo-one knowsEverybody's too afraid to talk about it anywayThese particular times everyone's out of lineIt makes no change it's so strangeEverybody's walking around so derangedShe asked me to play her that song everyone likesShe said she'd listen as the day is long and dance shed dance into the nightWe talked of dreams, romance and excessSomething inside of her tells me she climbs to be the bestThis you have to respectStuck in her dead in jobAnd yes she said, some things that she should not sayShe wonders if I rememberI was wasted anywayIt's the next weekWe stop and speakHappens all the timesIt's like a trend and it totally drives me round the bendThese particular timesEveryone's out of line it makes no changeIt's strangeEverybody's walking around so deranged
