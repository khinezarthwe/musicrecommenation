I'm going down to the place tonightTo see if I can get a taste tonightA taste of something warm and sweetThat shivers your bones and rises to your heatI'm going down to the place tonightThe damp and hungry place tonightShould all the stars shine in the skyThey couldn't outshine your sparkling eyesBut it's so hard to be the oneTo touch and tease and to do it all for funBut it's too much for a young heart to takeCause hearts are the easiest things you could breakAnd I talk to the filth, and I walk to the doorI'm knee deep in myselfBut I want to get more of that stuffOf that stuffSome candy talkingSome candy talkingTalkAnd I wantAnd I wantSome candy talkingSome candy talkingSome candy talkingSome candy talkingSome candy talkSome candy talkSome candy talkSome candy talkI love the way she's walkingI love the way she's talkingIt's just the way she's walkingIt's just the way she's talkingAnd I needAll that stuffGive me someOf that stuffI want your candyI want your candyAnd I needGive me someOf your stuffGive me someI want your candyI want your candyI want your candyI want your candyI want stuff
