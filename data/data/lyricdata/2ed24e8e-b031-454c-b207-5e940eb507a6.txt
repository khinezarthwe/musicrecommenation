Oh, and when will our heartbeats fall into line,And the click-clack of our boot heels beat out the same time?Oh, and when will your hand find itself in mine?Oh, and when will your hand find itself in mine?And though I don't know your real nameYour real age, or your shoe sizeI will leave this bedroom chairAnd this keyboard behindAnd I will love you in reality and dreamsAnd I will love you in reality and dreamsAnd though it kills me to knowThat when we are throughYou go to your real loverWho'll put real kisses on youOh well, an 'X' is about the best that I can doOh well, an 'X' is about the best that I can doAnd so this lonely, lonely heartHas no use left for livingAfter finding her loveIn a heart so unpermittingAnd I will die and never ever hold your handAnd I will die and never ever hold your handBut I'll kiss my lips and I'll blow it to youIt'll be the last thing that I ever doAnd wherever you go and whatever you doThere's a man underground that will always love youOh, wherever you go and whatever you doThere's a man underground that will always love youWherever you go and whatever you doThere's a man underground that will always love you
