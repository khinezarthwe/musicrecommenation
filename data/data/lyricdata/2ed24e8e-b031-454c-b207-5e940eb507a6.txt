Oh, and when will our heartbeats fall into line, And the click-clack of our boot heels beat out the same time? Oh, and when will your hand find itself in mine? Oh, and when will your hand find itself in mine? And though I don't know your real name Your real age, or your shoe size I will leave this bedroom chair And this keyboard behind And I will love you in reality and dreams And I will love you in reality and dreams And though it kills me to know That when we are through You go to your real lover Who'll put real kisses on you Oh well, an ' X' is about the best that I can do Oh well, an ' X' is about the best that I can do And so this lonely, lonely heart Has no use left for living After finding her love In a heart so unpermitting And I will die and never ever hold your hand And I will die and never ever hold your hand But I'll kiss my lips and I'll blow it to you It'll be the last thing that I ever do And wherever you go and whatever you do There's a man underground that will always love you Oh, wherever you go and whatever you do There's a man underground that will always love you Wherever you go and whatever you do There's a man underground that will always love you
