Here it comes againCannot outrun my desireCover my descentAnd throw the beauty on the fireDrawn towards the edgeDo I assume I could fly?Every secret sharedWhy do I drink the feelings dry?Don't go too farLimitation scarsTonight, could I be lost foreverTo drown my soul in Sensory Pleasure?Here it comes againYou raise the bar even higherI cannot catch my breathSo throw the beauty on the fireDon't push too hardLimitation scarsTonight, could I be lost foreverTo drown my soul in Sensory Pleasure?Sensory PleasureSensory PleasureSensory PleasureCould I be lost forever?Do I assume I could fly?Tonight, could I be lost foreverTo drown my soul in Sensory Pleasure?Sensory PleasureSensory PleasureSensory PleasureCould I be lost forever?
