Hair blowing in the hot windTime hanging from a clothespinThere's no sorrow that the sun's not gonna healI smell the leather of your new carDrive through the desert after nightfallSleep on the shoulder, keep the stars all to ourselvesThe kind of love that makes my back hurtWearin' nothing but a T-shirtShe's turning over on a mattress made of airI close my eyes and see a staircaseLeading upwards into blank spaceAll of creation makes a sound too soft to hearSo I remain between her legsSheltered from all my fearsWhile bikers glide by highway shrinesWhere pilgrims disappearI know that trouble's been your good friendKept you company on the weekendsKept you company even once your mind was madeYou said, it's over and it's finishedNow a headache's all you're left withWe're no different, I've got debts I'd like to payWe should move to SausalitoLiving's easy on a house boatLet the ocean rock us back and forth to sleepAnd in the morning when the sunriseLook in the water, see the blue skyAs if heaven has been laid there at our feetSo we remain between these wavesSheltered for all our yearsWhile bikers glide by highway shrinesWhere pilgrims disappearWhere time takes icebergsWhere fields burn westwardWhere pilgrims disappear
