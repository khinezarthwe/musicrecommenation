I didn't know what a brute I wasI dipped my cigarette and rode the busVengeance built me hastilyAnd I dragged the clanging notionI was nobody, nobodyNobodyAll I had was my intentionAnd my love invented all of youOh look what thoughts can doWhat thoughts can doIf you're not run-out, dead and buriedYou're most certifiably married, oh marriedI'm sure you're sleeping soundWith the mistress of the hoursThe hours that grind your life to dustYour easy loves you keep like petsDenied them you are powerlessWhatever keeps you sleeping through the nightI'm not the man you thought I wasMy love has never lived indoorsI've had to drag it home by forceHired hounds at both my wristsDamp and bruised by strangers' kisses on my lipsBut you're the one that I still missYou're the one that I still missAnd it's ruthless that it comes as no surpriseI'm not the man you think I amI'm not the man you think I am
