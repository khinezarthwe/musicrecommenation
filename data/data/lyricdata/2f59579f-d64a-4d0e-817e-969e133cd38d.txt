Face death of an innocent young girl We face death of an innocent child Cold blood, put to death without meaning We don't care because we think we are god Blind rage, black evil The last betrayal of our own flesh and blood Wake up, stop screaming We sell our soul and we kill our own god Face death of a whole generation We face death of the human kind Face death of a whole generation We face death of the weak and the blind Slow death of a man killed in blind rage Slow death of the human race Tormented bodies cast away in a black cage Tormented bodies cast away in a cage Blind rage, black evil The last betrayal of our own flesh and blood Wake up, stop screaming We sell our soul and we kill our own god Face death of a whole generation We face death of the human kind Face death of a whole generation We face death of the weak and the blind Face death of a whole generation We face death of the human kind Face death of a whole generation We face death of the weak and the blind[x2]
