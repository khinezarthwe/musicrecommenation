Annan water, you loom so deep and wideI would cross over if you would stem the tideOr build a boat that I might ford the other sideTo reach the farther shore where my true love lies in wait for meIn wait for me, in wait for me, in wait for meO gray river, your waters ramble wildThe horses shiver and bite against the bridleBut I will cross if mine own horse is pulled from meThough my mother cries that if I try I sure will drowned beWill drowned be, will drowned be, will drowned beBut if you calm and let me passYou may render me a wreck when I come backSo calm your waves and slow the churnAnd you may have my precious bones on my returnAnnan water, oh hear my true love's callHear her holler above your water's pallGod that I could, that my two arms could give me wingAnd I would cross your breadth and rest my breast about her amber ringHer amber ring, her amber ring, her amber ringBut if you calm and let me passYou may render me a wreck when I come backSo calm your waves and slow the churnAnd you may have my precious bones on my, on my return
