Been thinking about youYour records are hereYour eyes are on my wallYour teeth are over thereBut I'm still no oneAnd you're now a starWhat do you care?Been thinking about youAnd there's no restShit, I still love youStill see you in bedBut I'm playing with myselfAnd what do you careWhen the other men are far, far better?All the things you've gotAll the things you needWho bought you cigarettesWho bribed the company to come andSee you, honey?I've been thinking about youSo how can you sleep?These people aren't your friendsThey're paid to kiss your feetThey don't know what I knowAnd why should you careWhen I'm not there?Been thinking about youAnd there's no restShould I still love youStill see you in bed?But I'm playing with myselfAnd what do you careWhen I'm not there?All the things you've gotShe'll never needAll the things you've gotI've bled and I bleed toPlease youBeen thinking about you
