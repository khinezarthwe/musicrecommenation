Through the warmest cord of careYour love was sent to meI'm not sure what to do with itOr where to put itI'm so close to tearAnd so close to simply calling you upAnd simply suggestingWe go to that hidden placeThat we go to that hidden placeWe go to that hidden placeWe go to a hidden placeNow, I have been slightly shyBut I can smell a pinch of hopeTo almost have allowed once fingersTo strokeThe fingers I was given to touch withBut careful, carefulThere lies my passion hiddenThere lies my loveI'll hide it under a blanketLull it to sleepI'll keep it in a hidden placeI'll keep it in a hidden placeKeep it in a hidden placeKeep it in a hidden placeHe's the beautifulestFragilestStill strongDark and divineAnd the littleness of his movementsHides himselfHe invents a charmThat makes him invisibleHides in the hairCan I hide there too?Hide in the hair of himSeek solaceSanctuaryIn that hidden placeIn a hidden placeIn a hidden placeWe'll stay in a hidden placeOh, in a hidden placeWe'll live in a hidden placeWe'll be in a hidden placeIn a hidden place
