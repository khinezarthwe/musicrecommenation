Have no fear For when I'm alone I'll be better off Than I was before I've got this light I'll be around to grow Who I was before I cannot recall Long nights allow Me to feel I'm falling I am falling The lights go out Let me feel I'm falling I am falling Safely to the ground I'll take this soul That's inside me now Like a brand new friend I'll forever know I've got this life And the will to show I will always be Better than before Long nights allow Me to feel I'm falling I am falling The lights go out Let me feel I'm falling I am falling Safely to the ground
