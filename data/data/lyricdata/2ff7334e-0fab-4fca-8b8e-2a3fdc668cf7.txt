Have no fearFor when I'm aloneI'll be better offThan I was beforeI've got this lightI'll be around to growWho I was beforeI cannot recallLong nights allowMe to feel I'm fallingI am fallingThe lights go outLet me feel I'm fallingI am fallingSafely to the groundI'll take this soulThat's inside me nowLike a brand new friendI'll forever knowI've got this lifeAnd the will to showI will always beBetter than beforeLong nights allowMe to feel I'm fallingI am fallingThe lights go outLet me feel I'm fallingI am fallingSafely to the ground
