They're waking you up to close the barThe street's wet, you can tell by the sound of the carsThe bartender's singing "Clementine"While he's turning around the open signDreadful sorry, ClementineThough you're still her man it seems a long time goneMaybe the whole thing's wrongWhat if she thinks so but just didn't say soYou drank yourself into slow-moMade an angel in the snowAnything to pass the timeAnd keep that song out of your mindOh my darlingOh my darling, oh my darling ClementineDreadful sorry, ClementineDreadful sorry, Clementine
