You know what they say about getting olderIt's only a doorway awayYou know what they say about getting colderIn the middle of the dayYou can live in the corner of my roomAnd I will live somewhere between the ceiling and the wallAnd if I need anything at allI'll call out to youThat's what I'll doOh here we go again (x4)I'll sit out on the front sofa while your hands they talk to meAll of this dragging around it's not as fun as it used to beOh here we go again (x4)All that I wanted all that I needed (x2)Oh here we go again (x4)
