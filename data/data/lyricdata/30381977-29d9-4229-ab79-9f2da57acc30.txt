Here I am with all the pleasures of the first worldLaid out before me, who am I to break down?Every day I wake upI choose loveI choose lightAnd I try, it's too easy just to fall apartOh my baby don't be so distressedWe're done with politesseIt's time to be so brutally honest aboutThe way we know we long for something fineWhen we pine for higher ceilingsAnd bourgeois happy feelingsAnd here we are in the center of the first worldIt's laid out before us, who are we to break down?Every day we wake upWe choose loveWe choose lightAnd we try, it's too easy just to fall apartPlastic bottlesImported waterCars we drive wherever we want toClothes we buy it's sweatshop laborDrugs from corporate enablersWe're not living the good lifeUnless we're fighting the good fightYou and me just trying to get it rightIn the center of the first worldIt's laid out before us, who are we to break down?Every day we wake upWe choose loveWe choose lightAnd we try, it's too easy just to fall apartLove can free us from all excessFrom our deepest debtsCause when our hearts are full we need much lessYea I know we long for something fineWhen we pine for higher ceilingsAnd bourgeois happy feelingsBut here we are in the center of the first worldIt's laid out before us, who are we to break down?Here we are in the center of the first worldIt's laid out before us, who are we to break down?Every day we wake upWe choose loveWe choose lightAnd we try, it's too easy just to fall apartEvery day we wake upWe choose loveWe choose lightAnd we try, it's too easy just to fall apart
