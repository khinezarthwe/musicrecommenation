Here I am with all the pleasures of the first world Laid out before me, who am I to break down? Every day I wake up I choose love I choose light And I try, it's too easy just to fall apart Oh my baby don't be so distressed We're done with politesse It's time to be so brutally honest about The way we know we long for something fine When we pine for higher ceilings And bourgeois happy feelings And here we are in the center of the first world It's laid out before us, who are we to break down? Every day we wake up We choose love We choose light And we try, it's too easy just to fall apart Plastic bottles Imported water Cars we drive wherever we want to Clothes we buy it's sweatshop labor Drugs from corporate enablers We're not living the good life Unless we're fighting the good fight You and me just trying to get it right In the center of the first world It's laid out before us, who are we to break down? Every day we wake up We choose love We choose light And we try, it's too easy just to fall apart Love can free us from all excess From our deepest debts Cause when our hearts are full we need much less Yea I know we long for something fine When we pine for higher ceilings And bourgeois happy feelings But here we are in the center of the first world It's laid out before us, who are we to break down? Here we are in the center of the first world It's laid out before us, who are we to break down? Every day we wake up We choose love We choose light And we try, it's too easy just to fall apart Every day we wake up We choose love We choose light And we try, it's too easy just to fall apart
