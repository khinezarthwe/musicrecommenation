These are the tools at handand this is what you came for. So rest your faith on somesolemn note. When I give up on you it's not me being callous. Send me a letter, tell mehow it's going. Just stay the fuck away from me, until you reachsome understanding, I give up. The first one is the worst one,took all I thought I ever had. Well, maybe it's supposed to hurt some, but I can face it knowing; That after all this there will be some kind of prize to find,but I'm not the man tochance it anymore. I spent a lifetime being locked upin expectancydreaming of truce. Without these chains and iron mask to drag me downthrough veils of bone and bloodline I can see the lie It's up to you nowcompletion of thiseyes staring blindlyback at nothing So this is where it ends, your promises mean nothing. I will leave you here to die. Alone. A pale shadow of what was once.
