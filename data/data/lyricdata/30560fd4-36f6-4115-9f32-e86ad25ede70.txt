Step out the front door like a ghost into the fogWhere no one notices the contrast of white on whiteAnd in between the moon and you, angels get a better viewOf the crumbling difference between wrong and rightWell I walk in the air between the rainThrough myself and back again, where? I don't knowMaria says she's dying, through the door I hear her cryingWhy? I don't knowRound here, we always stand up straightRound here, something radiatesMaria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her handShe said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like ElvisAnd she walked along the edge of where the ocean meets the landJust like she's walking on a wire in the circusShe parks her car outside of my house and takes her clothes offSays she's close to understanding JesusAnd she knows she's more than just a little misunderstoodShe has trouble acting normal when she's nervousRound here, we're carving out our namesRound here, we all look the sameRound here, we talk just like lionsBut we sacrifice like lambsRound here, she's slipping though my handsOh, sleeping children better run like the windOut of the lightning dreamMama's little baby better get herself inOut of the lightningShe says, it's only in my headShe says, shhh, I know, it's only in my headBut the girl on the car in the parking lotSays, man, you should try to take a shotCan't you see my walls are crumbling?Then she looks up at the buildingSays she's thinking of jumpingShe says she's tired of lifeShe must be tired of somethingRound here, she's always on my mindRound here, hey man, I got lots of timeRound here, we're never sent to bed earlyAnd nobody makes us waitRound here, we stay up very, very, very, very lateI... I can't see nothing, nothing, round hereOh, you catch me if I'm fallingYou catch me if I'm fallingYou catch me 'cause I'm falling down on youI said I'm under the gun, round hereOh man, I said I'm under the gun, round hereAnd I can't see nothing, nothing, round here
