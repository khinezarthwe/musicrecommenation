Every day I wake up and it's SundayWhatever's in my eye won't go awayThe radio is playing all the usualAnd what's a wonderwall anyway?Because my inside is outsideMy right side's on the left side'Cause I'm writing to reach you now butI might never reach youOnly want to teach youAbout youBut that's not youIt's good to know that you are home for ChristmasIt's good to know that you are doing wellIt's good to know that you all know I'm hurtingIt's good to know I'm feeling not so wellBecause my inside is outsideMy right side's on the left side'Cause I'm writing to reach you now butI might never reach youOnly want to teach youAbout youBut that's not youDo you know it's true?But that won't doMaybe then tomorrow will be MondayAnd whatever's in my eye should go awayBut still the radio keeps playing all the usualAnd what's a wonderwall anyway?Because my inside is outsideMy right side's on the left side'Cause I'm writing to reach you now butI might never reach youOnly want to teach youAbout youBut that's not youDo you know it's true?But that won't doAnd you know it's youI'm talking to
