Do you hear me? I'm talking to youAcross the water across the deep blue oceanUnder the open sky oh my, baby I'm tryingBoy I hear you in my dreamsI feel your whisper across the seaI keep you with me in my heartYou make it easier when life gets hardLucky I'm in love with my best friendLucky to have been where I have beenLucky to be coming home againThey don't know how long it takesWaiting for a love like thisEvery time we say goodbyeI wish we had one more kissI wait for you I promise you I willLucky I'm in love with my best friendLucky to have been where I have beenLucky to be coming home againLucky we're in love in every wayLucky to have stayed where we have stayedLucky to be coming home somedayAnd so I'm sailing through the seaTo an island where we'll meetYou'll hear the music, fill the airI'll put a flower in your hairAnd though the breeze is through the treesMove so pretty you're all I seeAs the world keeps spinning roundYou hold me right here right nowLucky I'm in love with my best friendLucky to have been where I have beenLucky to be coming home againLucky we're in love every wayLucky to have stayed where we have stayedLucky to be coming home someday
