Time takes care of the woundOr so I can believeYou had so much to giveYou thought I couldn't seeGifts for bootheels to crushPromises deceivedI had to send it awayTo bring us back againYour eyes and body brightenSilent waters deepYour precious daughter in theOther room asleepA kiss goodnight from everyStranger that I meetI had to send it awayTo bring us back againMorning theftUnpretender left,Ungrateful...True self is whatBrought you here to meA place where we canAccept this loveFriendship battered down byUseless historyUnexamined failureWhat am I still to youSome thief who stole from you?Or some fool drama queenWhose chances were few?Love brings us to who we needA place where we can saveA heart that beatsAs both siphon and reservoirYou're a woman, I'm a calfYou're a window, I'm a knifeWe come togetherMaking chance into starlightMeet me tomorrow nightOr any day you wantI have no more right to wonderJust how or whenYou know the meaning fitsThere's no relief in thisI miss my beautiful friendI had to send it awayTo bring her back again
