Don't try to tell me that my intentions are untrueMy eyes like butterflies you caught 'em and they're open wideClouded and hazy future clear whenever I'm with youJust think of all the things we could do to pass the timeIt's a walk in the park, it goesNa na na, na na na, na na na na na naNa na na, na na na, na na na na na naCuz everybody's got a little pieces of someone they hideIt's okay, it's the way we distract until the day that we dieAnd though our future's gone uncertain, it's gonna be alright'Cause though I'm leaving longing leaves me ever by your sideAnd all our time together is tearing me apartI can't hold you tomorrow but I hold you in my heartAnd all our time together is tearing me apartI can't hold out forever, but I hold you in my heartDon't try to tell me that my intentions are untrueDon't even bother tryin' to tell me 'cause you live a lie'Cause a moment or a minute I can see it throughAnd have a precious little second of you by my side, it goesNa na na, na na na, na na na na na naNa na na, na na na, na na na na na naAnd our future's lookin brightIn all the little pieces of the people that we keep inside'Cause you can do-make-say-think-laugh-sink-drink all nightAll the little visions all the little moments that we keep insideAnd all our time together is tearing me apartI can't hold you tomorrow but I hold you in my heartAnd all our time together is tearing me apartI can't hold out forever, but I hold you in my heart
