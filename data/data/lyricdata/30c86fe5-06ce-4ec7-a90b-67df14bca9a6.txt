When the wind picked up, the fire spreadAnd the grapevine seemed left for deadAnd the northern sky looked like the end of daysThe end of daysThe wake-up call to a rented roomSounded like an alarm of impending doomTo warn us it's only a matter of timeBefore we all burnBefore we all burnBefore we all burnBefore we all burnWe bought some wine and some paper cupsNear your daughter's school when we picked her upAnd drove to a cemetery on a hillOn a hillAnd we watched the plumes paint the sky grayAs she laughed and danced through the field of gravesThere I knew it would be alrightThat everything would be alrightWould be alrightWould be alrightWould be alrightAnd the news reports on the radio said it was getting worseAs the ocean air fanned the flamesBut I couldn't think of anywhere I would've rather beenTo watch it all burn away, to burn awayThe firemen worked in double shiftsWith prayers for rain on their lipsAnd they knew it was only a matter of time
