SometimesI feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clearAnd I can't help but ask myself how much I'll let the fearTake the wheel and steerIt's driven me before and seems to have a vagueHaunting mass appealBut lately I'm beginning to find that IShould be the one behind the wheelWhatever tomorrow brings, I'll be thereWith open arms and open eyes, yeahWhatever tomorrow brings, I'll be thereI'll be thereSo, if I decide to waiver myChance to be one of the hiveWill I choose water over wineAnd hold my own and drive? Aah ah oooIt's driven me before and it seems to be the wayThat everyone else gets aroundBut lately I'm beginning to findThat when I drive myself my light is foundWhatever tomorrow brings, I'll be thereWith open arms and open eyes, yeahWhatever tomorrow brings, I'll be thereI'll be thereWould you choose water over wine?Hold the wheel and driveWhatever tomorrow bringsI'll be there with open arms and open eyes, yeahWhatever tomorrow bringsI'll be there, I'll be thereDododooo dododo dododododo, bum bum bum bumDododooo dododo dododododo, bum bum bum bum
