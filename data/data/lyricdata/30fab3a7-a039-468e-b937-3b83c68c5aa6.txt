I'm cryingI'm dyingI can see what's wrong with meIt's in my headI can see what's gonna beAs I lie in my bedMan is not my brotherhoodI am of the deadI died as I lived, as I loved and was bornOn some distant hillThe reasons to hide were the reasons I criedFools pass laughing stillThere can be bad blood in all and I can seeIt's in my brainYou don't know the pain I feelAs I must live againRocks and stones can't bruise my soulBut tears will leave a stainThey smile to themselves as they lay down my headOn some distant hillThe blind and the child sweep a tear from their eyeFools smile as they killI got my own way to go and now I wantTo take your mindsI believe if you could seeThe blood between the linesI believe that you could beA better kindPlease lead the way so the unborn can playOn some greener hillLaugh as the flames, eat their burning remainsFools die laughing still
