The traveller is always leaving townHe never has the time to turn aroundAnd if the road he's taken isn't leading anywhereHe seems to be completely unawareThe traveller is always leaving homeThe only kind of life he's ever knownWhen every moment seems to beA race against the timeThere's always one more mountain left to climbDays are numbersWatch the starsWe can only see so farSomeday, you'll know where you areRememberDays are numbersCount the starsWe can only go so farOne day, you'll know where you areThe traveller awaits the morning tideHe doesn't know what's on the other sideBut something deep inside of himKeeps telling him to goHe hasn't found a reason to say noThe traveller is only passing throughHe cannot understand your point of viewAbandoning reality, unsure of what he'll findThe traveller in me is close behindDays are numbersWatch the starsWe can only see so farSomeday, you'll know where you areRememberDays are numbersCount the starsWe can only go so farOne day, you'll know where you are
