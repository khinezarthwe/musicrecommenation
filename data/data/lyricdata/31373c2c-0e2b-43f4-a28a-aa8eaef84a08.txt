Heaven on EarthWe need it nowI'm sick of all of thisHanging aroundSick of sorrowI'm sick of the painI'm sick of hearingAgain and againThat there's gonna bePeace on EarthWhere I grew upThere weren't many treesWhere there was we'd tear them downAnd use them on our enemiesThey say that what you mockWill surely overtake youAnd you become a monsterSo the monster will not break youAnd it's already gone too farWho said that if you go in hardYou won't get hurtJesus can you take the timeTo throw a drowning man a linePeace on EarthTell the ones who hear no soundWhose sons are living in the groundPeace on EarthNo whos or whysNo one cries like a mother criesFor peace on EarthShe never got to say goodbyeTo see the color in his eyesNow he's in the dirtPeace on EarthThey're reading names outOver the radioAll the folks the rest of usWon't get to knowSean and JuliaGareth, Anne and BritaTheir lives are bigger thanAny big ideaJesus can you take the timeTo throw a drowning man a linePeace on EarthTo tell the ones who hear no soundWhose sons are living in the groundPeace on EarthJesus in the song you wroteThe words are sticking in my throatPeace on EarthHear it every Christmas timeBut hope and history won't rhymeSo what's it worthThis peace on EarthPeace on EarthPeace on EarthPeace on Earth
