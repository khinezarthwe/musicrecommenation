I'm coming homeI've been gone for far too longDo you remember me at all?I'm leavingHave I fucked things up again?I'm dreamingToo much time without you spent!It hurtsWounds so soreNow I'm tornNow I'm tornI've been far awayWhen I see your face myHeart's burst into fireHeart's burst into fireYou're not aloneI know I'm far from homeDo you remember me at all?I'm leavingDo you wait for me again?I'm screamingNo more days without you spentIt hurtsWounds so soreNow I'm tornNow I'm tornI've been far awayWhen I see your face myHeart's burst into fireHeart's burst into fireMy bed's so cold, so lonelyNo arms, just sheets to hold meHas this world stopped turning?Are we forever to be apart?(Forever to be apart)It hurtsWounds so soreNow I'm tornNow I'm tornI've been far awayWhen I see your face myHeart's burst into fireHeart's burst into fireI'm coming homeI've been gone for far too long!(I'm coming home)Do you remember me at all?Do you remember me at all?I'm leavingI'm screamingI'm dreamingMy heart's burst into fire
