I used to see you every day I used to see you every day I danced around your folk and soul I danced to all your fucking soul I left you with your nose a bleedin' And your toes creepin' around Ah, so mundane and incomplete Hand me down my pants and get me off this street I'm passed out in your garden I'm in, I can't get off So soft I'd pop myself in your body I'd come into your party But I'm soft Behind the fringe of a whiskey high Mutilating cat like eyes And in your nose, blood decadence You try to drag me into your bohemian dancing You paint my fingers and you paint my toes You let your perfect nipple show I'm passed out in your garden I'm in, I can't get off So soft I'd pop myself in your body I'd come into your party But I'm soft But I'm soft I'm passed out in your garden I'm in, I can't get off, I'm so soft I'd pop myself in your body I'd come all over your party, but I'm soft
