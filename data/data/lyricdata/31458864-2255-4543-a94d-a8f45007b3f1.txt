I used to see you every dayI used to see you every dayI danced around your folk and soulI danced to all your fucking soulI left you with your nose a bleedin'And your toes creepin' aroundAh, so mundane and incompleteHand me down my pants and get me off this streetI'm passed out in your gardenI'm in, I can't get offSo softI'd pop myself in your bodyI'd come into your partyBut I'm softBehind the fringe of a whiskey highMutilating cat like eyesAnd in your nose, blood decadenceYou try to drag me into your bohemian dancingYou paint my fingers and you paint my toesYou let your perfect nipple showI'm passed out in your gardenI'm in, I can't get offSo softI'd pop myself in your bodyI'd come into your partyBut I'm softBut I'm softI'm passed out in your gardenI'm in, I can't get off, I'm so softI'd pop myself in your bodyI'd come all over your party, but I'm soft
