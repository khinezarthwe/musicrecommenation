Fall around the fire And I, fall around the fire A higher me for you Hire me for you Fall around town, down For the rest of the world to drown For you'll come down To the rest of your falling down On your head Falling down With your head unbound I'm falling down Down to your ground Fall around town, down For the rest of the world to drown For you'll come down To the rest of your falling down On your head And I said you could hurt me No more With your heart on the floor I said you could hurt me no more To the rest of the world it's sure That you will hurt me no more To the rest of the world You're surely hurting, surely hurting more Falling down I'm falling down Downtown to your ground
