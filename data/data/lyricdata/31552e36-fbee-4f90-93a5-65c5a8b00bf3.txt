There's gotta be a record of you someplaceYou gotta be on somebody's booksThe lowdown - a picture of your faceYour injured looksThe sacred and profaneThe pleasure and the painSomewhere your fingerprints remain concreteAnd it's your face I'm looking for on every streetA ladykiller - regulation tattooSilver spurs on his heelsSays - what can I tell you, as I'm standing next to youShe threw herself under my wheelsOh it's a dangerous roadAnd a hazardous loadAnd the fireworks over liberty explode in the heatAnd it's your face I'm looking for on every streetA three-chord symphony crashes into spaceThe moon is hanging upside downI don't know why it is I'm still on the caseIt's a ravenous townAnd you still refuse to be tracedSeems to me such a wasteAnd every victory has a taste that's bittersweetAnd it's your face I'm looking for on every streetAnd it's your face I'm looking for on every street
