This is our last goodbye I hate to feel the love between us die But it's over Just hear this and then I'll go You gave me more to live for More than you'll ever know This is our last embrace Must I dream and always see your face Why can't we overcome this wall Baby, maybe it is just because I didn't know you at all Kiss me Please kiss me But kiss me out of desire, babe And not consolation You know it makes me so angry' Cause I know that in time I'll only make you cry This is our last goodbye Did you say " No, this can't happen to me" And did you rush to your phone to call? Was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind saying" Maybe... you didn't know him at all" You didn't know him at all You didn't know The bells out in the church tower chime Burning clues into this heart of mine Thinking so hard on her soft eyes and the memory Offer signs that it's over It's over
