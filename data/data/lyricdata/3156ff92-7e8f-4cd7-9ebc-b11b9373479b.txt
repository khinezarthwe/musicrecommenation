This is our last goodbyeI hate to feel the love between us dieBut it's overJust hear this and then I'll goYou gave me more to live forMore than you'll ever knowThis is our last embraceMust I dream and always see your faceWhy can't we overcome this wallBaby, maybe it is just because I didn't know you at allKiss mePlease kiss meBut kiss me out of desire, babeAnd not consolationYou know it makes me so angry'Cause I know that in timeI'll only make you cryThis is our last goodbyeDid you say "No, this can't happen to me"And did you rush to your phone to call?Was there a voice unkind in the back of your mind saying"Maybe... you didn't know him at all"You didn't know him at allYou didn't knowThe bells out in the church tower chimeBurning clues into this heart of mineThinking so hard on her soft eyes and the memoryOffer signs that it's overIt's over
