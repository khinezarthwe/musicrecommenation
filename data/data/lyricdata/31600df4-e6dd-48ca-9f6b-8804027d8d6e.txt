Just as you take my handJust as you write my number downJust as the drinks arriveJust as they play your favorite songAs your bad day disappearsNo longer wound up like a springBefore you've had too muchCome back in focus againThe walls are bending shapeThey got a cheshire cat grinAll blurring into oneThis place is on a missionBefore the night owlBefore the animal noisesClosed circuit camerasBefore you're comatoseBefore you run away from meBefore you're lost between the notesThe beat goes 'round and 'roundThe beat goes 'round and 'roundI never really got thereI just pretended that I hadWords are blunt instrumentsWords are sawed off shotgunsCome on and let it outCome on and let it outCome on and let it outCome on and let it outBefore you run away from meBefore you're lost between the notesJust as you take the micJust as you dance, dance, danceA jigsaw falling into placeSo there is nothing to explainYou eye each other as you passShe looks back and you look backNot just onceAnd not just twiceWish away your nightmareWish away the nightmareYou got a light you can feel it on your backA light and you can feel it on your backYour jigsaw falling into place
