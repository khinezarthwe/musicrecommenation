I decree today that lifeIs simply taking and not givingEngland is mine, it owes me a livingBut ask me why and I'll spit in your eyeOh ask me why and I'll spit in your eyeBut we cannot cling to the old dreams anymoreNo, we cannot cling to those dreamsDoes the body rule the mindOr does the mind rule the body?I don't know..Under the iron bridge we kissedAnd although I ended up with sore lipsIt just wasn't like the old days anymoreNo, it wasn't like those daysAm I still ill?Oh am I still ill?Does the body rule the mindOr does the mind rule the body?I don't know..Ask me why and I'll dieOh ask me why and I'll dieAnd if you must go to work tomorrowWell, if I were you I wouldn't botherFor there are brighter sides to lifeAnd I should know because I've seen themBut not very oftenUnder the iron bridge we kissedAnd although I ended up with sore lipsIt just wasn't like the old days anymoreNo, it wasn't like those daysAm I still ill?Oh am I still ill?
