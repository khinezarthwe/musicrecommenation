In the morning where does all the pain goThe same place the fame goes straight to your headAh, it's not easy gettin you out my headIt wasn't easy getting outta bedSo much shame on the workman who blames his toolsThen so the saying goes so it's saidThe way you tease me, tease me outta my headAh, it's not easy forgettin what you saidI know you used to be into me now you've got it in for meIn the morning where does all the pain goThe same place the fame goes straight to your headIt wasn't easy gettin you outta my headAh, it's too easy gettin outta my headGiven up trying to explain I'll just put it in a song insteadAh, it's not easy gettin outta bedAh, it's too easy gettin outta my headI know where to find, where to find you my loveAt the same old place by the river, the only way in isthrough the window, trough the window
