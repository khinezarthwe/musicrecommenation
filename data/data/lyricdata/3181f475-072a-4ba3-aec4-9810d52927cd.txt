That night her kiss told me it was overI walked out late into the darkThe misty gloom seems to soak up my sorrowThe further I went onI felt a spreading calmThen suddenly my eyes were bathed in lightAnd the lovely lady in white was by my sideShe said "Like me I see you're walking aloneWon't you please stay?"I couldn't look awayShe saidI love the nightThe day is OK and the sun can be fun but I liveTo see those rays slip awayI love the nightThere's so much that I can show and give to youIf you will welcome me tonightIf only you had been there my dearWe could have shared this togetherNo mortal was meant to know such wonderOne look in the mirror told me soCome darkness I'll see her againYes I'm gonna go'Cause now I knowI love the nightThe day is OK and the sun can be fun but I liveTo see those rays slip awayI love the nightI love the nightI love the night
