After seven years behind these bars togetherI'll miss you more than a brother when you go when you goIf only I had not tried to escapeThey'd barred me with you I know yes I knowWon't you tell the folks back home I'll soon be comingAnd don't let them know I never will be free be freeSometimes write and tell me how they're doingAnd send a picture of mother back to meSay hello to Dad and shake his poor hardworking handAnd send a picture of mother if you canI'm happy for you that you got your freedomBut stay with me just another minute or so or soAfter all this sweating blood togetherWho'll be my fighting partner when you go when you goThe hardest time will be on Sunday morningChurch bells will ring on Heaven Hill Heaven HillPlease ask Reverend Garrett to pray for meAnd send a picture of mother if you willSay hello to Dad and shake his poor hardworking handAnd send a picture of mother if you can
