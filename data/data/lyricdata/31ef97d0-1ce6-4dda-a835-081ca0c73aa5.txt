Well, the rain keeps on coming downIt feels like a flood in my headAnd that road keeps on calling meScreaming to everything lying aheadAnd it's a winding roadI've been walking for a long timeI still don't knowWhere it goesAnd it's a long way homeI've been searching for a long timeI still have hopeI'm gonna find my way homeAnd I can see a little houseOn top of the hillAnd I can smell the oceanThe salt in the airAnd I can see youYou're standing thereAnd you're washing your carAnd I can see California sun in your hairAnd its a winding roadI've been walking for a long timeStill don't knowWhere it goesAnd it's a long way homeI've been searching for a long timeStill have hopeI'm gonna find my way homeAll these dreams took me so farAnd I felt I just couldn't go onAnd I want to hangOut the window of your carAnd see just how good this baby can run'Cause it's a winding roadI've been walking for a long timeAnd I still don't knowWhere it goesAnd it's a long way homeI've been searching for a long timeStill have hopeWe're gonna find our way homeIt's a winding roadStill have hopeOne day we'll find our way homeIt's a long way homeI've been searching for a long timeStill have hopeWe're gonna find our way homeIt's a long way homeIt's a long way home
