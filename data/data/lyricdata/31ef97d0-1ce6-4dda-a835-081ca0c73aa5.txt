Well, the rain keeps on coming down It feels like a flood in my head And that road keeps on calling me Screaming to everything lying ahead And it's a winding road I've been walking for a long time I still don't know Where it goes And it's a long way home I've been searching for a long time I still have hope I'm gonna find my way home And I can see a little house On top of the hill And I can smell the ocean The salt in the air And I can see you You're standing there And you're washing your car And I can see California sun in your hair And its a winding road I've been walking for a long time Still don't know Where it goes And it's a long way home I've been searching for a long time Still have hope I'm gonna find my way home All these dreams took me so far And I felt I just couldn't go on And I want to hang Out the window of your car And see just how good this baby can run' Cause it's a winding road I've been walking for a long time And I still don't know Where it goes And it's a long way home I've been searching for a long time Still have hope We're gonna find our way home It's a winding road Still have hope One day we'll find our way home It's a long way home I've been searching for a long time Still have hope We're gonna find our way home It's a long way home It's a long way home
