And here I am softer than a showerAnd here I am to garland you with flowersTo lay you down in clover bedThe stars, a roof above our headsAnd all my life I never felt the tremorAnd all my life that now disturbs my fingersI'll lay you down in clover bedThe stars, a roof above our headsAnd we'll lie 'til the corncrake crowsBereft the weight of our summer clothesAnd I'd wager all, the hazards of love, the hazards of loveAnd take my hand and cradle it in your handAnd take my hand to feel the pull, the quicksandI'll lay you down in clover bedThe stars, a roof above our headsAnd we'll lie till the corncrake crowsBereft the weight of our summer clothesAnd I'd wager all, the hazards of love, the hazards of loveThe hazards of love, the hazards of love
