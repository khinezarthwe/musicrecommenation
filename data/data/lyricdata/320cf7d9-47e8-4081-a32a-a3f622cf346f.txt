Here shall we live in this terrible townWhere the price for our eyes shall squeeze them tight like a fistAnd the walls shall have eyesAnd the doors shall have earsBut we'll dance in the darkAnd they'll play with our livesLike a Slow BurnLeading us on and on and onLike a Slow BurnTurning us round and round and roundBut who are weSo small in times such as theseSlow BurnSlow BurnOh, these are the daysThese are the strangest of allThese are the nightsThese are the darkest to fallBut who knows?Echoes in tenement hallsWho knows?Though the years snare them allLike a Slow BurnLeading us on and on and onLike a Slow BurnTwirling us round and round and upside downThere's fear overheadThere's fear overgroundSlow BurnSlow BurnLike a Slow BurnLeading us on and on and onLike a Slow BurnTurning us round and round and roundAnd here are weAt the center of it allSlow BurnSlow BurnSlow Burn
