I sleep with my hands across my chestAnd I dream of you with someone elseI feed my body with things that I don't needUntil I sink to the bottomDon't act like it came as a surpriseDon't believe me? Then look into these eyesThis can't go on so I should justRegret it, regret it, regret itAnd even though I led you onForget it, forget it, forget itI'm going missing for a whileI've got nothing left to loseI don't listen to anythingI still remember how you movedAnd I taste you scent upon my lipsHow it started, I will never knowBut now I've reached my limitThis can't go on so I should justRegret it, regret it, regret itAnd even though I led you onForget it, forget it, forget itI'm going missing for a whileI've got nothing left to loseI don't listen to anythingI'm going missing for a whileI've got nothing left to loseI don't listen to anythingDo you ever want to wear your body outUntil there's nothing left to take?The rain began to push you awayHas midnight come too soon again?I'm going missing for a whileI've got nothing left to loseI don't listen to anythingI've got nothing in defenceI've got nothing left to loseI don't listen to anythingI sleep with my hands across my chestAnd I dream of you with someone else
