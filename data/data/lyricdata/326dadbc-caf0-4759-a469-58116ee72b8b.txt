Now I smoke a lot of cigarettesAnd I've been drinking too much wineYou've been patient and understandingI guess I went to far this timeI cut you with my drunken wordsSo much sharper than a knifeBut, you turned the tables on me, babyJust by walking out of my lifeToo late to say I'm sorryIt won't happen anymoreBut you don't believe a word I say'Cause you've heard it all beforeBut all the sameWon't you take me back againDon't say it's overAfter all that we've been throughTake some time to think about it, babyWhile I sing my song to youYour suitcase by the back doorPacked with broken dreamsWhen night time comes to call on meI'll know what loneliness meansBut all the sameWon't you take me back againTake me back againTake me back againAll I'm asking is forgivenessWon't you take me back againTake me back againTake me back againAll I'm asking is forgivenessWon't you take me back againBut, baby, all the sameWon't you take me back againTake me back againTake me back againBut, baby, all the sameWon't you take me back againTake me back againTake me back againWon't you take me back againNo, no, no, no, take me back againDon't walk away from me, babyI begging you pleaseI begging you pleaseTake me back againTake me back again
