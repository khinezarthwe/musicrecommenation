There's something cold beyond my actionsIn front of you I feel lostAnd bloodlessLike a piece of glassLike an independent secondThe time has lost each meaningAnd I wait outside my dressJust likeA cold alien injectionI'm feeling insideMy own distortionSpinning aroundMy mind's connectionI feel voices insideLike an infectionThere's something cold beyond my actionsIn front of you I feel lostAnd bloodlessLike a piece of glassTryin' to make a transformationThere is no cureFor what I've beenAnd what I will be againThere is not a breath in this emptyNo one in my secret spaceI blast all around the worldEverything cannot belong to meI hear voices insideInside my headAnd then far away...The human race...Just likeA cold alien injectionI'm feeling insideMy own distortionSpinning aroundMy mind's connectionI feel voices insideLike an infection
