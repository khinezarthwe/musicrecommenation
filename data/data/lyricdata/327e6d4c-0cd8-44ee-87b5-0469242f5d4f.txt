There's something cold beyond my actions In front of you I feel lost And bloodless Like a piece of glass Like an independent second The time has lost each meaning And I wait outside my dress Just like A cold alien injection I'm feeling inside My own distortion Spinning around My mind's connection I feel voices inside Like an infection There's something cold beyond my actions In front of you I feel lost And bloodless Like a piece of glass Tryin' to make a transformation There is no cure For what I've been And what I will be again There is not a breath in this empty No one in my secret space I blast all around the world Everything cannot belong to me I hear voices inside Inside my head And then far away... The human race... Just like A cold alien injection I'm feeling inside My own distortion Spinning around My mind's connection I feel voices inside Like an infection
