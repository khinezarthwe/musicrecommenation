I do declare I was surprised to see you stayOnly to be betrayed by the one you gave all your love and trustAnd tell me how could I let goSince I caught a glimpse of your immense soulYou were dancing to northern soulJust one glance, ah well you knowThere she goes a little heartacheThere she goes a little painMake no mistake she sheds her skin like a snakeOn the dirty road to fameThere she goes a little heartacheThere she goes a little painMake no mistake she sheds her skin like a snakeYou're going to walk the plank again, walk the plank againI was to implore that you forget all you sawWhen you came through my door and from your bagYou pulled out more skag than I'd ever seenNo! How could I let go?Since I caught a glimpse of your white plimsolesTwisting and turning to northern soulJust one glance, ah well you knowEverybody knowsThere she goes a little heartacheThere she goes a little painMake no mistake she sheds her skin like a snakeOn the dirty road to fameThere she goes a little heartacheThere she goes a little painMake no mistake she sheds her skin like a snakeYou're going to walk the plank again, walk the plank againThere she goes a little, there she, there she, there she goes
