Brighten the corners and clear out the roomColor the flowers in rose and maroonLight up the fires and season this wineWe're gonna party like it's 1699Slaughter the rabbits,The doves and the boarsAnd lay all the tables and open the doorsThe Creme del a Creme will be waitingOn one guest of honorOh up go the curtainsAnd down go the virginsOh no, mothers are cryingLadies of virtue, will stand to accuse you of heartbreak and theftBells are gonna ringBirds are gonna singLet the people beginThe crowning of your big headYoung drunken girls in a hideous danceSing a heartfelt lamentOf the death of romanceBeautiful boys turn and offer their cheeksPreening and prancing,The outcome looks bleakGood times are rollingBut outside these wallsOur houses will crumble, this city will fallBut a few broken pawns don't mean nothingTo our guest of honorSo let's raise our glassesTo murderess asses like youMay you sleep soundlyOnce we had laughter,You got what you're afterOh you wear it wellBells are gonna ringBirds are gonna singLet the people beginHear how the hearts are poundingWe're all witnessing the crowningOf your big bleeding headBells are gonna ringBirds ar gonna singLet the people beginHear how the hearts are poundingYour rise, nothing but astoundingWe're all witnessing the crowningOn your useless, ruthless head
