This is my face: Covered in freckles, with the occasional spot and some veins... This is my body: Covered in skin, and not all of it you can see... And this is my mind: It goes over and over the same old lines... And this is my brain: Its torturous analytical thoughts make me go insane... And I use mouthwash - Sometimes I floss; I got a family, and I drink cups of tea... I've got nostalgic pavements, I've got familiar faces, I've got mixed-up memories, and I've got favourite places... And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night... And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night... And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night, and I hope everything's gonna be alright; And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night, and I hope everything's gonna be alright... This is my face: I've got a thousand opinions, and half the time, I'm trying to explain... And this is my body: No matter how you try and disable it, yes, I'll still be here... And this is my mind: And although you try to infringe, you cannot confine... And this is my brain: And even if you try and hold me back, there's nothing that you can gain...' Cause I use mouthwash - Sometimes I floss; I've got a family, and I drink cups of tea... I've got nostalgic pavements, I've got familiar faces, I've got mixed-up memories, and I've got favourite places... And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night... And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night... And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night, and I hope everything's gonna be alright; And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night, and I hope everything's gonna be alright... Oh, uh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ah, uh-oh, ah, ah, ah, ah...
