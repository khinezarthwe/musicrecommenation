This is my face:Covered in freckles, with the occasional spot and some veins...This is my body:Covered in skin, and not all of it you can see...And this is my mind:It goes over and over the same old lines...And this is my brain:Its torturous analytical thoughts make me go insane...And I use mouthwash - Sometimes I floss;I got a family, and I drink cups of tea...I've got nostalgic pavements, I've got familiar faces,I've got mixed-up memories, and I've got favourite places...And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night...And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night...And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night, and I hope everything's gonna be alright;And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night, and I hope everything's gonna be alright...This is my face:I've got a thousand opinions, and half the time, I'm trying to explain...And this is my body:No matter how you try and disable it, yes, I'll still be here...And this is my mind:And although you try to infringe, you cannot confine...And this is my brain:And even if you try and hold me back, there's nothing that you can gain...'Cause I use mouthwash - Sometimes I floss;I've got a family, and I drink cups of tea...I've got nostalgic pavements, I've got familiar faces,I've got mixed-up memories, and I've got favourite places...And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night...And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night...And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night, and I hope everything's gonna be alright;And I'm singing "oh oh" on a Friday night, and I hope everything's gonna be alright...Oh, uh-oh, oh-oh-oh, ah, uh-oh, ah, ah, ah, ah...
