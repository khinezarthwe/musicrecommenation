I got two strong armsBlessings of BabylonTime to carry on and tryFor sins and false alarmsSo to America the braveWise men saveNear a tree by a riverThere's a hole in the groundWhere an old man of AranGoes around and aroundAnd his mind is a beaconIn the veil of the nightFor a strange kind of fashionThere's a wrong and a rightBut he'll never, never fight over youI got plans for usNights in the sculleryAnd days instead of meI only know what to discussOh, for anything but lightWise men fighting over youIt's not me you seePieces of valentineAnd just a song of mineTo keep from burning historySeasons of gasoline and goldWise men foldNear a tree by a riverThere's a hole in the groundWhere an old man of AranGoes around and aroundAnd his mind is a beaconIn the veil of the nightFor a strange kind of fashionThere's a wrong and a rightBut he'll never, never fight over youI got time to killSly looks in corridorsWithout a plan of yoursA blackbird sings on bluebird hillThanks to the calling of the wildWise men's childNear a tree by a riverThere's a hole in the groundWhere an old man of AranGoes around and aroundAnd his mind is a beaconIn the veil of the nightFor a strange kind of fashionThere's a wrong and a rightBut he'll never, never fightNear a tree by a riverThere's a hole in the groundWhere an old man of AranGoes around and aroundAnd his mind is a beaconIn the veil of the nightFor a strange kind of fashionThere's a wrong and a rightBut he'll never, never fight over youNo he'll never, never fight over you
