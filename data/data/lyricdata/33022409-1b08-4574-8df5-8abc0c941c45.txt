I feel like a quote out of contextWithholding the restSo I can be for you what you want to seeI've got the gesture and soundsGot the timing downIt's uncanny, yeah, you'd think it was meDo you think I should take a classTo lose my southern accentDid I make me up, or make the face till it stuckI do the best imitation of myselfThe "problem with you" speechYou gave me was fineI liked the theories about my little stageAnd I swore I was listeningBut I started driftingAround the part about me acting my ageNow if it's all the sameI've people to entertainYou know I juggle one handedDo some magic tricks andThe best imitation of myselfMaybe I'm thinking myself in a holeWondering who I am, when I ought to knowStraighten up now time to goFool somebody elseFool somebody elseLast night I was east with them and west withinTrying to be for you what you wanna seeBut I can't help it with youThe good and bad comes throughDon't want you hanging out with no one but meNow if it's all the sameIt comes from the same placeAnd if my mind's somewhere elseYou won't be able to tellI do the best imitation of myselfYes it's uncanny to seeYou'd really think it was meThe best imitation of myselfThe best imitation of myself
