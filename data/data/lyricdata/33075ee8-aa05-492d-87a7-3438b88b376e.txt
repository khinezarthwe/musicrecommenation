Bursting through the fires avengingFatal warning battles are ragingPower of darkness rise for the fightWe'll be strong and stand our groundDeath is all around us and my heart is beating weakerFight the day with power of immortal souls ariseFire in our hearts the evil rages on forever moreBurning until the battle rage is goneThrough damnation we rise sign of the times master of bleeding eyesThunder on high look to the sky you never gonna take us downAnd we will crush the evil standing on the temple in the fire stormingFly beyond the lost horizons highHeroes of the night are callingSee the promised land is fallingReaching for the powers deep insideOn through the nightBlinded by the hate and desireBurning in your heart like a fireChallenging all the suffer and fear our horizons take controlBlood spills all around us and our enemies draw nearerSacrifice your life to have them carry you awayTake us to the place of death and carry on forever moreBurning on the dreams of memories long goneAnd you'll die for your crimes sign of the times master of endless liesFight to the end now we ascend together we will take them downAnd we will crush the evil standing on the temple in the fire stormingFly beyond the lost horizons highHeroes of the night are callingSee the promised land is fallingReaching for the powers deep insideOn through the nightInstrumental BridgeSolos: Herman/Sam/Herman/SamAnd we will crush the evil standing on the temple in the fire stormingFly beyond the lost horizons highHeroes of the night are callingSee the promised land is fallingReaching for the powers deep insideOn through the night
