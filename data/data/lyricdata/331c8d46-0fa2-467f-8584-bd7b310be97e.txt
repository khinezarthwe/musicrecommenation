Come on, oh my star is fadingAnd I swerve out of controlAnd if I, oh if I'd only waitedI'd not be stuck here in this holeCome here, oh my star is fadingAnd I swerve out of controlAnd I swear, I waited and waitedI've got to get out of this holeBut time is on your sideIt's on your side nowNot pushing you down and all aroundIt's no cause for concernCome on, oh my star is fadingAnd I see no chance of releaseAnd I know I'm dead on the surfaceBut I am screaming underneathAnd time is on your sideIt's on your side nowNot pushing you down and all aroundOh, it's no cause for concernStuck on the endOf this ball and chainAnd I'm on my way back down againStood on a bridgeTied to a nooseSick to the stomachYou can say what you meanBut it won't change a thingI'm sick of the secretsStood on the edgeTied to a nooseAnd you came alongAnd you cut me looseYou came alongAnd you cut me looseYou came alongAnd you cut me loose
