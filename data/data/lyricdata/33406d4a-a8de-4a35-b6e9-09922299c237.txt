Come into these arms againAnd lay your body downThe rhythm of this trembling heartIs beating like a drum.It beats for you - It bleeds for youIt knows not how it soundsFor it is the drum of drumsIt is the song of songs...Once I had the rarest roseThat ever deigned to bloom.Cruel winter chilled the budAnd stole my flower too soon.Oh loneliness - oh hopelessnessTo search the ends of timeFor there is in all the worldNo greater love than mine.Love, oh love, oh love...Still falls the rain... (still falls the rain)Love, oh love, oh, love...Still falls the night...Love, oh love, oh love...Be mine forever... (be mine forever)Love, oh love, oh love...Let me be the only oneTo keep you from the coldNow the floor of heaven's lainWith stars of brightest gold.They shine for you - they shine for youThey burn for all to seeCome into these arms againAnd set this spirit free.
