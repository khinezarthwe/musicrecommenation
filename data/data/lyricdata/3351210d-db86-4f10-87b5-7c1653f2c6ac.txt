There's a story in your eyesI can see the hurt behind your smileFor every sign I recognizeAnother one escapes meLet me know what plagues your mindLet me be the one to know you bestBe the one to hold you upWhen you feel like you're sinkingTell me once againWhat's beneath the pain you're feelingDon't abandon meOr think you can't be savedI walk beside youWherever you areWhatever it takesNo matter how farThrough all that may comeAnd all that may goI walk beside youI walk beside youSummon up your ghosts from meRest your tired thoughts upon my handsStep inside this sacred placeWhen all your dreams seem brokenResonate inside this templeLet me be the one who understandsBe the one to carry youWhen you can walk no furtherTell me once againWhat's below the surface bleedingIf you've lost your wayI will take you inI walk beside youWherever you areWhatever it takesNo matter how farThrough all that may comeAnd all that may goI walk beside youI walk beside youOh when everything is wrongOh when hopelessness surrounds youOh the sun will rise againThe tide you swim against will carry you back homeSo don't give upDon't give inI walk beside youWherever you areWhatever it takesNo matter how farThrough all that may comeAnd all that may goI walk beside youI walk beside you
