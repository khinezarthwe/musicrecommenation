You make the scene like you always do Going upstream down the avenue To fuck some trophy boy that you won tonight at the bar So bad, so far You'll make him sad, shooting star When it was me I was momentarily proud Drunk on dreams, now I'm glad I didn't say out loud You said you'd be for real but I don't believe that you are So bad, so far You made me sad, shooting star You're distant and cold and a sight to behold Everybody just sighs No one gets on with you very long' Cause you don't feel bad when you lie I'm going to sleep now, going back to find square one Square two will be where I can deal with the shit you've just done It won't be soon To say the least it's gonna be hard So bad, so far Your love is sad, shooting star Your love is sad, shooting star
