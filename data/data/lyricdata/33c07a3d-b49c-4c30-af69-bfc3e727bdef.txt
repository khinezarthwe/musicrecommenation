You make the scene like you always doGoing upstream down the avenueTo fuck some trophy boy that you won tonight at the barSo bad, so farYou'll make him sad, shooting starWhen it was me I was momentarily proudDrunk on dreams, now I'm glad I didn't say out loudYou said you'd be for real but I don't believe that you areSo bad, so farYou made me sad, shooting starYou're distant and cold and a sight to beholdEverybody just sighsNo one gets on with you very long'Cause you don't feel bad when you lieI'm going to sleep now, going back to find square oneSquare two will be where I can deal with the shit you've just doneIt won't be soonTo say the least it's gonna be hardSo bad, so farYour love is sad, shooting starYour love is sad, shooting star
