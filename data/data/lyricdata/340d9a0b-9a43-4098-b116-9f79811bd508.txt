Is that you?Is that, is that really you?To call between my lipsTwo kangaroo fingers pushThrough and scratch my back in rhythmSlow footSlow, fastWaiting for a night to wrap around usI could go in thereGet some sweet stuffAll these thingsIn me, in meAll these thingsIn me, in meIs that you?Is that, is that really you?To hold beneath my skinTwo numbers click between her touchWhen you pull me down into themRising and risingBird on the inside of a glass eye beatingCalling me in thereGet that sweet stuffAll these thingsIn me, in meAll these thingsIn me, in me(Did you come around...)
