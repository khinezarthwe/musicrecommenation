Oh, this morning sure could've changed our pastOh, please just make this moment lastOh, this morning sure couldn't changed our pastIf this feeling stays I will remember last night foreverI try to hold it insideSo why are you happening?One moment two sensesAll that I want is no more fallingNo moreSo why just change your heart?We're losing our minds'Cause conscious minds make mistakesStop wasting my timeDidn't think things could change this fastOh, this morning sure could've changed our pastOh, please just make this moment lastOh, this morning sure could've changed our pastIf this feeling stays I will remember last night forever
