Oh, this morning sure could've changed our past Oh, please just make this moment last Oh, this morning sure couldn't changed our past If this feeling stays I will remember last night forever I try to hold it inside So why are you happening? One moment two senses All that I want is no more falling No more So why just change your heart? We're losing our minds' Cause conscious minds make mistakes Stop wasting my time Didn't think things could change this fast Oh, this morning sure could've changed our past Oh, please just make this moment last Oh, this morning sure could've changed our past If this feeling stays I will remember last night forever
