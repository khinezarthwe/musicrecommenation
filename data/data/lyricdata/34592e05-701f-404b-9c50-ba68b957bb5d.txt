NOW!Persian night! BabeSee the light! BabeSave us!Jesus!Save us!So when the music's overWhen the music's over, yeahWhen the music's overTurn out the lightsTurn out the lightsTurn out the lightsWell, the music is your special friendDance on fire as it intendsMusic is your only friendUntil the endUntil the endUntil the end
