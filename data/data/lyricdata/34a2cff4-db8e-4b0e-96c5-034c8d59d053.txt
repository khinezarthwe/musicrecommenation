It feels like I'm water What do you mean son? It feels like I'm crying flesh It looks like tears have dropped on Messiah And all of the flood can fit into your screen It must be the soil I was using To stop ghosts from feeding my brain, Lost in the woods where my generation grows And where they write That every kid owns every house Well it's gonna be different now that I'm gone And the tilted bodyguards took your wife and your dog Life is better now when you Own every tree, own every yard Well it's gonna be different now that I'm gone To shot some aliens for kingdom and glory For welfare and for life itself Take me away son; wash all the years' son Away with the tears of my youth Today I'm sober, today I'm clean Today I feel like I'm stuck in between It must be the soil you where using To stop ghosts from feeding my brain, Lost in the woods where my generation grows And where they write That every kid owns every house Well it's gonna be different now that I'm gone And the tilted bodyguards took your wife and your dog Life is better now when you Own every tree, own every yard Well it's gonna be different now that I'm gone To shot some aliens for kingdom and glory For welfare and for life itself Birthdays are your days The first days of your days We're gonna be having some fun That every kid owns every house Well it's gonna be different now that I'm gone And the tilted bodyguards took your wife and your dog Life is better now when you Own every tree, own every yard Well it's gonna be different now that I'm gone To shot some aliens for kingdom and glory For welfare and for life itself For welfare and for life itself
