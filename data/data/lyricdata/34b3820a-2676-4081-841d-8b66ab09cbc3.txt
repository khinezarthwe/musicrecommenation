If it's true a rich man leads a sad life That's what they say from day to day Then what do all the poor do with their lives? On Judgment Day with nothing to say? I've been beat up, I've been thrown out But I'm not down, I'm not down I've been shown up, but I've grown up And I'm not down, no I'm not down On my own I faced a gang of jeering In strange streets When my nerves were pumping and I fought my fear in I didn't run, I was not done I've been beat up, I've been thrown out But I'm not down, no I'm not down I've been shown up, but I've grown up And I'm not down, no I'm not down And I have lived that kind of day When none of your sorrows will go away Go down and down and hit the floor Down and down and down some more, depression But I know there'll be some way When I can swing everything back my way Like skyscrapers rising up Floor by floor, not giving up So you rock around and think that you're the toughest In the world, the whole wide world But you're streets away from where it gets the roughest You ain't been there I've been beat up, I've been thrown out But I'm not down, no I'm not down I've been shown up, but I've grown up And I'm not down, no I'm not down I'm not down No, I'm not down
