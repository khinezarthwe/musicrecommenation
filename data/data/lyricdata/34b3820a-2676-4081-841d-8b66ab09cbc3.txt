If it's true a rich man leads a sad lifeThat's what they say from day to dayThen what do all the poor do with their lives?On Judgment Day with nothing to say?I've been beat up, I've been thrown outBut I'm not down, I'm not downI've been shown up, but I've grown upAnd I'm not down, no I'm not downOn my own I faced a gang of jeeringIn strange streetsWhen my nerves were pumping and I fought my fear inI didn't run, I was not doneI've been beat up, I've been thrown outBut I'm not down, no I'm not downI've been shown up, but I've grown upAnd I'm not down, no I'm not downAnd I have lived that kind of dayWhen none of your sorrows will go awayGo down and down and hit the floorDown and down and down some more, depressionBut I know there'll be some wayWhen I can swing everything back my wayLike skyscrapers rising upFloor by floor, not giving upSo you rock around and think that you're the toughestIn the world, the whole wide worldBut you're streets away from where it gets the roughestYou ain't been thereI've been beat up, I've been thrown outBut I'm not down, no I'm not downI've been shown up, but I've grown upAnd I'm not down, no I'm not downI'm not downNo, I'm not down
