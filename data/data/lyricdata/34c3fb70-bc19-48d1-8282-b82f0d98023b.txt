What a performance tonightShould I react or turn off the light?Looks like you're picking a fightIn a blurring of wrong and rightBut how your mood changesYou're a devil, now an angelSuddenly subtle and solemn and silent as a monkYou only tell me you love me when you're drunkIt's better than nothing, I supposeSome doors have opened, others closedBut I couldn't see you exposedTo the horrors behind some of thoseSomebody said, "Listen,Don't you know what you're missing?You should be kissing him instead of dissing him likeA punk"But you only tell me you love me when you're drunkYou only tell me you love me when you're drunkAll of my friends keep asking me"Why?  Oh, whyDo you not say goodbye?If you don't even tryYou'll be sunk"'Cause you only tell me you love me when you're drunkWhat's the meaningWhen you speak with so much feeling?Is it over when you're sober?Is it junk?You only tell me you love me when you're drunkYou only tell me you love me when you're drunk
