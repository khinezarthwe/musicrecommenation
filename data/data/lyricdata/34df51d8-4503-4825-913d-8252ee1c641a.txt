Nobody really knowsWhere they're supposed to goHiding behind a wallAfraid that they'll lose it allBut it's alrightJust follow the lightAnd don't be afraid of the darkIn the moonlight you'll dance till you fallAnd always be here in my heartBut nobody wants to know'Cause nobody even caresEveryone's on the makeOh and everyone's out for themselvesMe I'm on the longest roadWhere everything's overloadBut I've got my heart and soulSo don't throw me overboard'Cause it's alrightJust follow the lightAnd don't be afraid of the darkIn the moonlightYou'll dance till you fallAnd always be here in my heart'Cause it's alrightJust follow the lightAnd don't be afraid of the darkIn the moonlightYou'll dance till you fallAnd always be here in my heart'Cause it's alrightAlright nowAnd you're alrightYeah we're alright now
