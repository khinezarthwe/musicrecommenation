My cup runneth overLike blood from a stoneThese stand for meName your god and bleed the freakI'd like to seeHow you all would bleed for meWhen the pig runs slowerLet the arrow flyWhen the sin lies bolderI'll pluck out thine eyeThese stand for meName your god and bleed the freakI'd like to seeHow you all would bleed for meIf you scorn my loverSatan got your thighIf you steal in hungerI will kick you when you tryThese stand for meName your god and bleed the freakI'd like to seeHow you all would bleed for meThese stand for meName your god and bleed the freakI'd like to seeHow you all would bleed for me
