Tell me how do I get to know you? You untie me as if i were a shoelace You let out all I could hold between my buttons But from you I get nothing Even if I gave you a mountain on a bad day You don’t think you’re worth the top of And how can I change that When it’s in your fundament You can’t take a compliment Take a rest with me After a long day Foot is on the table Don’t take them down, down, down Don’t take them down Is it your parents? Or just the past? Is it your parents? Or just the past? If you should reach what you aim for Don’t give yourself the blame for what’s obviously not your fault And don’t laugh this away You won’t get to hear what I really have to say What I see is not what you think I see And what I think is not what you think I think I know me but you don’t know me As I don’t know you but.. Take a rest with me After a long day Foot is on the table Don’t take them down, down, down Don’t take them down Is it your parents? Or just the past? Is it your parents? Or just the past?
