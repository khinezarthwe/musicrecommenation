You will know by the way That he cuts his eyes Looks away from the door That walked in you You will know it will go Down in history How sweet he was to you And all the others So hand it over Cause we don't own it It's in the mystery Our silent fantasy' Cause I Nor you Could ever Know what it's like To have the night fall And be felled by the night No, we don't own it All you know is the way That he made you feel He made you feel safe enough To feel at all It's all there in the moment You understood That he's not going on And you're still going on So hand it over' Cause we don't own it It's in the mystery Our silent fantasy' Cause I Nor you Could ever Know what it's like To have the night fall And be felled by the night No, we don't own it It's his story Our subtle jealousy' Cause I Nor you Could ever Know what it's like To have the night fall And be felled by the night No, we don't own it
