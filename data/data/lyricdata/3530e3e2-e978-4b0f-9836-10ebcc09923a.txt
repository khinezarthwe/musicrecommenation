In the shuffling madness of the locomotive breathRuns the all-time loser headlong to his deathOh, he feels the pistons scrapingSteam breaking on his browOld Charlie stole the handleAnd the train, it won't stop goingNo way to slow downHe sees his children jumpin' off at stations, one by oneHis woman and his best friend in bed and having funOh, he's crawling down the corridorOn his hands and kneesOld Charlie stole the handleAnd the train, it won't stop goingNo way to slow downHe hears the silence howling, catches angels as they fallAnd the all time winner has got him by the ballsOh, he picks up Gideon's BibleOpen at page oneI thank God, he stole the handleAnd the train, it won't stop goingNo way to slow downNo way to slow downNo way to slow downNo way to slow downNo way to slow downNo way to slow downNo way to slow down
