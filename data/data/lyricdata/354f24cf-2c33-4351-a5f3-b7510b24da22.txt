Oh the leaves are falling from the trees And the snow is coming don't you know But I still remember which way to go I'm on the road, the road to home Oh the sound is fading in my ears And I can't believe I've lasted all these years But I still remember which way to go I'm on the road, the road to home Oh the light is fading all the time And this life I'm in, it seemed to pass me by But I still remember which way to go I'm on the road, the road to home Now I must say goodbye Keep telling myself now don't you cry But I'm here where I belong I'll see you soon, it won't be long I'll see you soon, it won't be long I'll see you soon It won't be long I don't know if you can see The changes that have come over me In these last few days I've been afraid That I might drift away So I've been telling old stories, singing songs That make me think about where I came from And that's the reason why I seem So far away today Oh, but let me tell you that I love you That I think about you all the time Caledonia you're calling me And now I'm going home If I should become a stranger You know that it would make me more than sad Caledonia's been everything I've ever had
