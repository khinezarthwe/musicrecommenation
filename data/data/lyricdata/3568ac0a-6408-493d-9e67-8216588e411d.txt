Beauty is what eyes beholdAnd you burn brighter than mostI chased you through the midnight streetsTo be where I could speak freelyI didn't care what tomorrow heldI felt the world turning only for usOnly bliss now for you and meRise up, let life's kiss send us reelingAnd unlike the times beforeFrom yesterday comes tomorrowWhen life comes alive the past moves asideNo regrets and no remorseCome onCome onCome onWe have more than everythingMore than man or machineMore than luck, more than fictionHigher than any religionAnd not like the times beforeFrom yesterday comes tomorrowWhen life comes alive the past moves asideNo regrets and no remorseWe'll squeeze the blood out of lifeAnd say goodnight to the silver of oldAnd even when wrong we're rightFar beyond the world of diamonds and goldI've come to realizeWhere happiness liesI want you to know I knowCome onCome onCome onAnd not like the times beforeFrom yesterday comes tomorrowWhen life comes alive the past moves asideNo regrets and no remorseCome onCome onCome on
