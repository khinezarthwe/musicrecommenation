Krill edible oceans at their feetA troublesome troop out on safari, a lullabyHolds their drones in sleepFor tatteling clearly indiscreetFive fallible flags in hypersonic are told toStay nearly out of reachAnd in space... two receivers turn awayJust in case... two receivers turn awayTo displace... two receivers turn awayAnd in space...Submissions in outer regions pleased a gatheringOf teens in old sargasso who's aim is toFall flat at their feetWhile sat on a sparsely crowded beachMarine noticed change in perfect timingA widow to all but her pasticheAnd in space... two receivers turn awayJust in case... two receivers turn awayTo displace... two receivers turn awayAnd in space...Eternal flow, strings to your bowRoam through the globe.
