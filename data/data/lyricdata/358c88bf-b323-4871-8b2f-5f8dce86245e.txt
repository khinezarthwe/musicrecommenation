Krill edible oceans at their feet A troublesome troop out on safari, a lullaby Holds their drones in sleep For tatteling clearly indiscreet Five fallible flags in hypersonic are told to Stay nearly out of reach And in space... two receivers turn away Just in case... two receivers turn away To displace... two receivers turn away And in space... Submissions in outer regions pleased a gathering Of teens in old sargasso who's aim is to Fall flat at their feet While sat on a sparsely crowded beach Marine noticed change in perfect timing A widow to all but her pastiche And in space... two receivers turn away Just in case... two receivers turn away To displace... two receivers turn away And in space... Eternal flow, strings to your bow Roam through the globe.
