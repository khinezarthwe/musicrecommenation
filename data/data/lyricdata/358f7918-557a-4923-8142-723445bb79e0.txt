We began by sharing more together Black against white made it alright Things are different now, we've grown apart So it's ok, call it a day What can I say Let's just remember what we had Keep on looking for that rainbow, rainbow, Rainbow's end And when you find that rainbow, rainbow, Start again I know now that it all seems wrong But we had no choice Change is a thing we can't avoid And even though we're singing different songs Love still lasts, time will pass You and I will always get by So keep on looking for that rainbow, rainbow, Rainbow's end And when you find that rainbow, rainbow, Start again Keep on looking for that rainbow, rainbow, Start again I hope you find that rainbow, rainbow, Rainbow's end
