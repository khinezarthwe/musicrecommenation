I know that you want the candy Gimme candy I've never had Tastes so sweet Makes good love bad Sweet, sweet lips The taste of you tonight Turn me on Strangers in delight Sugar done melt the day The dark comes bittersweet Black lollipops Come on, gimme a dirty treat I know that you want the candy Gimme candy I've never had Tastes so sweet Makes good love bad Fallen out with my love A grievous time to pass Sugar done break my heart A heart not meant to last In spite of saddened days I hooked myself on you But all my troubled ways Still walked with me boo hoo I know that you want the candy Gimme candy I've never had Tastes so sweet Makes good love bad Gimme some C to kill Gimme some C to tease Gimme some C so I can wrap Myself in you, oh please But everything came around Candy done taste sweet Made me think what I found An expired love treat I gave myself to you I wanted nothing back I plowed my way through hell For a sweet, sweet love attack I know that you want the candy Gimme some candy I've never had Taste so sweet Makes good love bad
