If we burn our wingsFlying too close to the sunIf the moment of gloryIs over before it's begunIf the dream is wonThough everything is lostWe will pay the priceBut we will not count the costWe will pay the priceBut we will not count the costWhen the dust has clearedAnd victory deniedA summit too loftyRiver a little too wideIf we keep our prideThough paradise is lostWe will pay the priceBut we will not count the costWe will pay the priceBut we will not count the costOh, ohAnd if the music stopsThere's only the sound of the rainAll the hope and gloryAll the sacrifice in vainAnd if love remainsThough everything is lostWe will pay the priceBut we will not count the costWe will pay the priceBut we will not count the costAnd if love remainsThough everything is lostWe will pay the priceBut we will not count the costAnd if love remainsThough everything is lostWe will pay the priceBut we will not count the costAnd if love remains
