Only know what I'm told, only know what I'm toldFast asleep daydreamingStart to push, break your own glass ceilingCan't count, catch the pieces fallingWho let it end up on the groundHow am I gonna know you're letting me downHow did I end up on the groundOnly do what I'm told, only do what I'm toldLast to leave, cold callingYou're gonna lose your arms, amputate plasticineThere's no knight in silver armor shiningWho let it end up on the groundHow am I gonna know I'm letting you downWho let it end up on the groundHow did it end up on the groundFace down on the groundOnly go where I'm told, only know what I'm toldInch to inches crowdingWe can't leave, it's the last road openEvery speed on our knees is crawling
