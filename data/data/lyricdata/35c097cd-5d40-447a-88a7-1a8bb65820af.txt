A low riding junkie girlRode down south to your little world, like a dreamYou can do it if you want to, you can do it if you want toYou can do it if you want to be like meI wouldn't need a heroIf I wasn't such a zeroIf I wasn't such a zeroGood to goAll I ever see around hereIs things of hers that you left lying aroundIt's all I ever see around hereShe kicked New York like a curseAnd you traced her footsteps in reverse up to QueensYou can do it if you want to, you can do it if you want toYou can do it if you want to be like meI wouldn't need a heroIf I wasn't such a zeroIf I wasn't such a zeroGood to goAll I ever see around hereIs things of hers that you left lying aroundIt's all I ever see around hereIs some empty envelopes from some other townIt's all I ever see around hereI'm waiting for something that's not coming
