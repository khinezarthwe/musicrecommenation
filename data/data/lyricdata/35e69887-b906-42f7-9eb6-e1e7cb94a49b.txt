Reverend, reverendIs this some conspiracy?Crucified for no sinsNo revenge beneath meLost within my plans for lifeIt all seems so unrealI'm a man cut in half in this worldLeft in my miseryThe reverend he turned to meWithout a tear in his eyesNothing new for him to seeI didn't ask him whyI will rememberThe love our souls had sworn to makeNow I watch the falling rainAll my mind can see now is yourWell, I guess you took my youthAnd gave it all awayLike the birth of a new found joyThis love would end in rageAnd when she died, I couldn't cryThe pride within my soulYou left me incompleteAll alone as the memories now unfoldBelieve the wordI will unlock my doorAnd pass the cemetery gatesSometimes when I'm aloneI wonder aloudIf you're watching over meSome place far aboundI must reverse my lifeI can't live in the pastThen set my soul freeBelong to me at lastThrough all those complex yearsI thought I was aloneI didn't care to look aroundAnd make this world my ownAnd when she died, I should've criedAnd spared myself some painYou left me incompleteAll alone as the memories still remainThe way we wereA chance to save my soulAnd my concern is now in vainBelieve the wordI will unlock my doorAnd pass the cemetery gatesThe way we wereThe chance to save my soulAnd my concern is now in vainBelieve the wordI will unlock my doorAnd pass the cemeteryGatesGatesGates
