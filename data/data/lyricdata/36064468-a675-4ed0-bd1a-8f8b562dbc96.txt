Please forgive me If I act alittle strange For I know not what I do. Feels like lightning running through my veins Everytime I look at you Everytime I look at you Help me out here All my words are falling short And there's so much I want to say Want to tell you just how good it feels When you look at me that way When you look at me that way Throw a stone and watch the ripples flow Moving out across the bay Like a stone I fall into your eyes Deep into some mystery Deep into that mystery I got half a mind to scream out loud I got half a mind to die So I won't ever have to lose you girl Won't ever have to say goodbye I won't ever have to lie Won't ever have to say goodbye Yeah na na na na Yeah na na na na Please forgive me If I act alittle strange For I know not what I do It's like my head is filled with lightning girl Everytime I look at you Everytime I look at you Everytime I look at you Everytime I look at you
