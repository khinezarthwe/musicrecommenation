Please forgive meIf I act alittle strangeFor I know not what I do.Feels like lightning running through my veinsEverytime I look at youEverytime I look at youHelp me out hereAll my words are falling shortAnd there's so much I want to sayWant to tell you just how good it feelsWhen you look at me that wayWhen you look at me that wayThrow a stone and watch the ripples flowMoving out across the bayLike a stone I fall into your eyesDeep into some mysteryDeep into that mysteryI got half a mind to scream out loudI got half a mind to dieSo I won't ever have to lose you girlWon't ever have to say goodbyeI won't ever have to lieWon't ever have to say goodbyeYeah na na na naYeah na na na naPlease forgive meIf I act alittle strangeFor I know not what I doIt's like my head is filled with lightning girlEverytime I look at youEverytime I look at youEverytime I look at youEverytime I look at you
