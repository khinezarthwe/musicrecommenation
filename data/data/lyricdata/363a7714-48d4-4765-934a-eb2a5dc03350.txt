As the music roaredWe moved through the crowdI kissed your lipsThere was no one aroundThere was no one aroundIn a house made of glassThere's a boy throwing rocksEvery love's like his lastCause you're heart's all you gotYeah your heart's all you gotCause it's been so long since you've been aroundI've never missed a stranger beforeI think it's loveit's Judas' callI've never missed a stranger before like youShe wore lace 'round her hairYeah she looked like queenWith eyes so fairShe was something of a dreamShe was something of a dreamCause it's been so long since you've been aroundI've never missed a stranger beforeI think it's loveit's Judas' callI've never missed a stranger before like youCause it's been so long since you've been aroundI've never missed a stranger beforeI think it's loveit's Judas' callI've never missed a stranger before like you
