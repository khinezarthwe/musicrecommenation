As the music roared We moved through the crowd I kissed your lips There was no one around There was no one around In a house made of glass There's a boy throwing rocks Every love's like his last Cause you're heart's all you got Yeah your heart's all you got Cause it's been so long since you've been around I've never missed a stranger before I think it's loveit's Judas' call I've never missed a stranger before like you She wore lace 'round her hair Yeah she looked like queen With eyes so fair She was something of a dream She was something of a dream Cause it's been so long since you've been around I've never missed a stranger before I think it's loveit's Judas' call I've never missed a stranger before like you Cause it's been so long since you've been around I've never missed a stranger before I think it's loveit's Judas' call I've never missed a stranger before like you
