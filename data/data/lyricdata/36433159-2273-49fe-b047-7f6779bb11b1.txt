She put $900On the fifth horse in the sixth raceI think its name was Chips AhoyCame in six lengths aheadWe spent the whole next week getting highAt first I thought that she hitOn some tip that she got from some other boyWe were overjoyedI got a girl and she don't have to workShe can tell which horse is gonna finish in firstSome nights the painkillers make the pain even worseCame in six lengths aheadWe spent the whole next week getting highI love this girl but I can't tell if she's having a good timeHow am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't let me touch you?How am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't even dance?How am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't let me touch you?How am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't even dance?She's hard on the heart and she's soft to the touchShe gets migraine headaches when she does it too muchShe always does it too muchHow am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't let me touch you?How am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't even dance?How am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't let me touch you?How am I supposed to know that you're high if you won't even dance?And you won't even dance
