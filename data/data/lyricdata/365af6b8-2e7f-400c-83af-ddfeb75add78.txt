See me, I see you too There's no strings to what we do It's a wireless phase and the camera stays I bend into place, a Maria full of Grace And I wonder if you could do All I do for you And it's so original and it's so beautiful I can see me in the way you are Knowing everywhere I go you're my picture on the wall I see me in the way I am When I reach town, baby I'm a touchdown I see us in the way we are And I'm running for a train and I'm coming home again And then maybe I can slowdown Walk in a circle Trying to find our way home It's cruel to detain me Unbuckle and deplane me A wireless phase and the camera says I bend into place a Maria full of Grace Do you know what I do for you Know what I do, do you And it's so beautiful and it's so original I can see me in the way you are Knowing everywhere I go you're my picture on the wall I see me in the way I am When I reach town, baby I'm a touchdown I see us in the way we are And I'm running for a train and I'm coming home again And then maybe I can slow down Walk in a circle Finding our way home Run in a circle Finding our way home
