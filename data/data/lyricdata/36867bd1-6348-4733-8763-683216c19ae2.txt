Last time I saw you, you were on stageYour hair was wild, your eyes were brightAnd you were in a rageYou were swinging your guitar aroundCuz they wanted to hear that soundBut you didn't want to playAnd I don't blame youI don't blame youBeen around the world, in many situationsBeen inside many heads in different positionsBut you never wanted them that wayWhat a cruel price you thought that you had to payThem back for all that shit on stageBut it never made sense to them anywayCould you imagine when they turned their backsThey were only scratching their headsCuz you simply deserve the bestAnd I don't blame youI don't blame youThey said you were the bestBut then they were only kidsThen you would recall the deadly houses you grew up inJust because they knew your nameDoesn't mean they know from where you cameWhat a sad trick you thought that you had to playBut I don't blame youThey never owned itAnd you never owed it to them anywayI don't blame you
