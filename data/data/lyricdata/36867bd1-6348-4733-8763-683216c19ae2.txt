Last time I saw you, you were on stage Your hair was wild, your eyes were bright And you were in a rage You were swinging your guitar around Cuz they wanted to hear that sound But you didn't want to play And I don't blame you I don't blame you Been around the world, in many situations Been inside many heads in different positions But you never wanted them that way What a cruel price you thought that you had to pay Them back for all that shit on stage But it never made sense to them anyway Could you imagine when they turned their backs They were only scratching their heads Cuz you simply deserve the best And I don't blame you I don't blame you They said you were the best But then they were only kids Then you would recall the deadly houses you grew up in Just because they knew your name Doesn't mean they know from where you came What a sad trick you thought that you had to play But I don't blame you They never owned it And you never owed it to them anyway I don't blame you
