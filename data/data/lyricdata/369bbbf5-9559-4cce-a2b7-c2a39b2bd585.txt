The marriage has come to my headThe wedding trumpets are deadReplaced by a static noiseSo loud that I can't hear my own voiceWill those signs lead me out of hereWell, just take me somewhereTo the plains where angels singThrough the chime and the clatteringFor what it's worth the truth might hurt youThere is a little you can doWhen shadows fall I will desert youThen that's what you will doFor what it's worth the truth might hurt youAnd with a tear of morning dew...My temples born anewLead me insideLead me insideLead me inside out of the coldLet me insideFeel me insideWhen the seed is sownOur love's dead by dawnAnd as the day beginsThe sun is soothing my skinAnd I am dividedI am dividedFor loveI have to sayThat all of this timeI waited for someone like youYour are my dreamYour are my dreamYour are my dream
