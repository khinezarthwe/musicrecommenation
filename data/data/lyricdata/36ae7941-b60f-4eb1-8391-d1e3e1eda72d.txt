I dreamed I was missingYou were so scaredBut no one would listen'Cause no one else caredAfter my dreamingI woke with this fearWhat am I leavingWhen I'm done here?So if you're asking me I want you to knowWhen my time comesForget the wrong that I've doneHelp me leave behind someReasons to be missedAnd don't resent meAnd when you're feeling emptyKeep me in your memoryLeave out all the restLeave out all the restDon't be afraidI've taken my beatingI've shed what I madeI'm strong on the surfaceNot all the way throughI've never been perfectBut neither have youSo if you're asking me I want you to knowWhen my time comesForget the wrong that I've doneHelp me leave behind someReasons to be missedDon't resent meAnd when you're feeling emptyKeep me in your memoryLeave out all the restLeave out all the restForgettingAll the hurt inside you've learned to hide so wellPretendingSomeone else can come and save me from myselfI can't be who you areWhen my time comesForget the wrong that I've doneHelp me leave behind someReasons to be missedDon't resent meAnd when you're feeling emptyKeep me in your memoryLeave out all the restLeave out all the restForgettingAll the hurt inside you've learned to hide so wellPretendingSomeone else can come and save me from myselfI can't be who you areI can't be who you are
