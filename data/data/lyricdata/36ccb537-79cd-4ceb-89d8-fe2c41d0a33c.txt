Baby, I'm stuck in the middle, and I don't know whyFind the words you sing to beSweeter than the words of the bird in the skyOh, the days you came aroundI feel so good for meI can take most anything'Cause what you bringI find it to be magicalI feel like I'm loving you in 1963Flowers in my hairLittle bitty hearts upon my cheekBaby, you'll be on my mind'Til I kiss you next timeBaby, come on, take a ride in my little blue bugKeep the windows downDon't forget to celebrate the radio's upOh, the way you hold my handThere is no other wayWe could take a thousand walksAnd laugh all dayI find it to be magicalI feel like I'm loving you in 1963Flowers in my hair nowLittle bitty hearts upon my cheekBaby, you'll be on my mind'Til I kiss you next time
