Baby, I'm stuck in the middle, and I don't know why Find the words you sing to be Sweeter than the words of the bird in the sky Oh, the days you came around I feel so good for me I can take most anything' Cause what you bring I find it to be magical I feel like I'm loving you in 1963 Flowers in my hair Little bitty hearts upon my cheek Baby, you'll be on my mind' Til I kiss you next time Baby, come on, take a ride in my little blue bug Keep the windows down Don't forget to celebrate the radio's up Oh, the way you hold my hand There is no other way We could take a thousand walks And laugh all day I find it to be magical I feel like I'm loving you in 1963 Flowers in my hair now Little bitty hearts upon my cheek Baby, you'll be on my mind' Til I kiss you next time
