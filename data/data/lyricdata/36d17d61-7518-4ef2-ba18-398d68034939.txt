It's all coming back to me nowThat strange and almost endless dreamWhere I was you and you were meYou opened up your eyes and I could seeThat you were falling from the worldAs aimless as a shooting star in orbit around meThinking I was somebody elseAnd terrified to look at me and see yourself, well...You are like a dreamAnd I am just a trip that you are onWhen the trip is over you will go backTo the places that you once belovedYou will look for comfort thereAnd when you do you'll find that it has goneThat is when you'll dream a dreamWhere I am you and you are meAnd then you'll know my loveSo don't be afraidYour heart is in meAnd it's racing so fast now'Cause everything we ever were or ever will beIs shapeless as a changing cloudYour letter written on the skyI'm needing now to read it through my eyesWhen you see just what I seeThen tenderly watch it changeAnd just let it be'Cause I am like a dreamAnd you are just a trip that I am onWhen the trip is over I will go backTo the places that I once belovedAnd I will look for comfort thereAnd when I do I know it will be goneThat is when I'll dream a dreamWhere I am you and you are meAnd then I'll know your love...so quiet now...This is just some trip that we are onWhen the trip is over we will think of thisAs someplace that we once belovedWhen I find no comfort hereI'll look again to find it in your armsThat is where I'll dream a dreamWhere I am you and you are meAnd that's where I know love
