It's all coming back to me now That strange and almost endless dream Where I was you and you were me You opened up your eyes and I could see That you were falling from the world As aimless as a shooting star in orbit around me Thinking I was somebody else And terrified to look at me and see yourself, well... You are like a dream And I am just a trip that you are on When the trip is over you will go back To the places that you once beloved You will look for comfort there And when you do you'll find that it has gone That is when you'll dream a dream Where I am you and you are me And then you'll know my love So don't be afraid Your heart is in me And it's racing so fast now' Cause everything we ever were or ever will be Is shapeless as a changing cloud Your letter written on the sky I'm needing now to read it through my eyes When you see just what I see Then tenderly watch it change And just let it be' Cause I am like a dream And you are just a trip that I am on When the trip is over I will go back To the places that I once beloved And I will look for comfort there And when I do I know it will be gone That is when I'll dream a dream Where I am you and you are me And then I'll know your love...so quiet now... This is just some trip that we are on When the trip is over we will think of this As someplace that we once beloved When I find no comfort here I'll look again to find it in your arms That is where I'll dream a dream Where I am you and you are me And that's where I know love
