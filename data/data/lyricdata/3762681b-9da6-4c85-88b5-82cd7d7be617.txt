Cheers darlin' Here's to you and your lover boy Cheers darlin' I got years to wait around for you Cheers darlin' I've got your wedding bells in my ear Cheers darlin' You give me three cigarettes To smoke my tears away And I die when you mention his name And I lied, I should have kissed you When we were running in the rains What am I, darlin'? A whisper in your ear? A piece of your cake? What am I, darlin'? The boy you can fear? Or your biggest mistake? Cheers darlin' Here's to you and your lover man Cheers darlin' I just hang around and eat from a can Cheers darlin' I got a ribbon of green on my guitar Cheers darlin' I got a beauty queen To sit not very far from here I die when he comes around To take you home I'm too shy, I should have kissed you When we were alone What am I, darlin'? A whisper in your ear? A piece of your cake? What am I, darlin'? The boy you can fear? Or your biggest mistake? What am I? What am I, darlin'? I got years to wait around for you
