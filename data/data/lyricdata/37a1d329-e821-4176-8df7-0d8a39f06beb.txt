Just last night I woke from some unconscionable dreamAnd had it nailed to my forehead againTo keep this boat afloat, there are things you can't afford to knowSo I save all my breath for the sailsBut you'll find those lingering voicesAre just your ego's attempt to make it all clean and nice and make a moron out of youWalking a bridge on weakening cablesHuddled up in fear and hate because we know our fate and it's a lot to put us throughMost ideas turn to dust, as there are few in which we all can trustHaven't you noticed I've been shedding all of mine?So let's abandon that track and leave our fathers fighting in a sack'Cause we're way too wise-assed for thatYou might find some fools at your doorstepHustling the latest changes to the book that's the strangest in an attempt to multiplyMarionettes on weakening cablesHuddled up with fear and hate because they know their fate and it's a lot to put them throughWe've taken on a climbAnd it's long enough to put the best of us on our backsWalking up a slideAnd there are those we know who'd have us five miles off the trackYou will find those lingering voicesAre just your ego's attempt to make it all clean and nice and make a moron out of youCrossing a bridge on weakening cablesHuddled up with fear and hate because we know our fate and it's a lot to put us through
