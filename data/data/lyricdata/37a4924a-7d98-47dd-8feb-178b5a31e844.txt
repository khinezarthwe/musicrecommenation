I'm going round, I'm going downTo my friend's house to get myself highIt takes me to a different placeWhere nothing leaves my mindBut the men in blue knocked on my doorHe said I've come to kill off your kindIt's the killing of the mindThe circus came then packed up their thingsWhen there's no one aroundWe'll be high as kings, without the thingsLike jewels and goldI'm rolling down, I'm rolling down to my hotelBetween the linesThe paperboy still looks the sameAs the old get old and the young are feeling fineA soldier came, knocked on my wallHe said I've come to kill off your kindIt's the killing of the mindThe circus came then packed up their thingsWhen there's no one aroundWe'll be high as kings, without the thingsLike jewels and goldThe circus came then packed up their thingsWhen there's no one aroundWe'll be high as kings, without the thingsLike jewels and gold
