Faster moments spent spread tales of change within the soundCounting form through rhythm electric freedomMoves to counter-balance stars expound our conscienceAll to know and see the look in your eyesPassing time will reach as nature relays to set the sceneNew encounters spark a true fruitionGuiding lines we touch them, our bodies balance out the wavesAs we accelerate our days to the look in your eyesFrom the moment I reached out to hold, I felt a soundAnd what touches our soul slowly moves as touch reboundsAnd to know that tempo will continueLost in the trance of dances as rhythm takes another turnAs is my want, I only reach to look in your eyesCHA-CHA-CHA CHA-CHA
