Fly like an eagle,An outlaw of the sun,Stealing 'round your bedroom doorA case of hit 'n run.Sinner, sinner,I'm no angel you can see.So I will tell you nowAnd I won't say it again,Don't mess with meOh baby, don't mess with me.Ride like a demon,The devil's only son.A whiskey drinking son of a bitch,I've only just begun.Sinner, sinner,I'm no angel you can see.I told you once beforeAnd I won't say it again,Don't mess with me,Don't mess with me.(Solo)Soothe me baby like I soothe you,Treat me baby like I treat you.Soothe me baby like I soothe you,Treat me baby like I...Fly like an eagleAn outlaw of the sun,Never take what sleeps aroundBut, always get your fun.Sinner, sinner,You're no angel I can see.I told you once beforeAnd I won't say it again,Don't mess with me,Don't mess with me.'Cos I'm a sinnerAnd sinners ain't the loving kind.
