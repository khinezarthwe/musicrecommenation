Here comes the Rumour Mill And I'm not even trying It's a game of Cat and Mouse But I can't tell who's lying You can tell in the way that I walk that I am frightened They're bearing down on me What have I done to spite them? They keep on lying like no one really matters And then those lies they just scatter and scatter Can't hear my thoughts above the sound of the chatter They keep on lying to you They keep on lying to you Here comes the vanguard man It seems he is delirious He keeps mocking me I can't tell if he's serious Have you seen how he jokes and he smiles Yet he sleeps like a child Tall tales, cliques and whispers Tell of secret kisses They keep on lying like no one really matters And then those lies they just scatter and scatter They keep on lying like no one really matters And then those lies they just scatter and scatter Can't hear my thoughts above the sound of the chatter They keep on lying to you They keep on lying to you Here comes a bitter pill But I don't think I'll take it Like you I'm scared of everything they're saying But I know there is no other way, there is no other way Tall tales, cliques and whispers Tell of secret kisses They keep on lying like no one really matters And then those lies they just scatter and scatter Can't hear my thoughts above the sound of the chatter And you'll be sorry when you They keep on lying like no one really matters And then those lies they just scatter and scatter They keep on lying like no one really matters And then those lies they just scatter and scatter Can't hear my thoughts above the sound of the chatter They keep on lying to you (x9) And you'll be sorry when you Come to your senses
