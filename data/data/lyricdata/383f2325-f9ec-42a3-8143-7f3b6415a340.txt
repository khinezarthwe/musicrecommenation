(Ronnie VanZant)"Well when I was a young-un they used to teach me to play music like this here..."When I look in your face babyWhen I look in your eyesI can tell pretty mama I been wastin' time'Cause you don't really love meYou just love me for what I amBut you best treat me right, womanGonna lose your money manWell when I first met you baby, you was a red light girlBut I tried to take you to better worldBut you would not listenStill you think I am a foolWell you had it made in the shade, babyDon't let that tree fall down on youWell I work the railroad each and every dayWell I work real hard tryin' to make my payLord I never tell you what you supposed to sayGirl you had it made in the shadeDon't let that tree fall down on you
