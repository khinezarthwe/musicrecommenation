Here he comesWith his 12 o'clock junkHis camels ridesAnd his stars are drunkWho's that dressed in black?Who's that in his apartment?With his crazy walk?Don't let him come backThe two of us hereDoes that constitute a crowdHe needs some helpBut his prideMuch too proudWho's that dressed in black?Who's that in his apartment?With his crazy walk?Don't let him come backI'm dead or I'm deadHe thinks dark skies hold jewelsHe wants an excuseTo be what king Richard rulesWho's that dressed in black?Who's that in his apartment?With his crazy walk?Don't let him come back
