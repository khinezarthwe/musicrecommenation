Here he comes With his 12 o'clock junk His camels rides And his stars are drunk Who's that dressed in black? Who's that in his apartment? With his crazy walk? Don't let him come back The two of us here Does that constitute a crowd He needs some help But his pride Much too proud Who's that dressed in black? Who's that in his apartment? With his crazy walk? Don't let him come back I'm dead or I'm dead He thinks dark skies hold jewels He wants an excuse To be what king Richard rules Who's that dressed in black? Who's that in his apartment? With his crazy walk? Don't let him come back
