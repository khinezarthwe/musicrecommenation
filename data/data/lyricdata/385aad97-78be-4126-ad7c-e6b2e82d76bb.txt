Blood runs free, down the river I'm the weeper, the life beriever I cross the Styx, with coins of onyx Without the trumphets and horns and pyres Empracing the Styx Life is floating out, wave after wave Empracing the Styx I sail with Charon this day Embracing the Styx Life is floating out, wave after wave Embracing the Styx Me, my wrists and a blade The final curtain, death is certain Harpy's sing, my soul is hurting Razors, rope, mountains of dope Does it matter, there's no hope Empracing the Styx Life is floating out, wave after wave Empracing the Styx I sail with Charon this day Embracing the Styx Life is floating out, wave after wave Embracing the Styx Me, my wrists and a blade In times of eternal darkness In times of peace and embrace When the minstrel of atrophy mock us There's need for love and there's need for death Too late for understanding Too late for your tears I wait for the last descending To the opal city and the flaming stairs I surrender, I return to dust It must end here, in daze and dusk So I cry, for all of us And I smile, as I die...
