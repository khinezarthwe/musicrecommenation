You bit your lip and on the tip Of your tongue was your view You hadn't dealt with how you felt In ways that suited you The paper cuts From the love letters You never gave him could not meet Your new found needs for misbehaving Why? Why would you say sorry? Oh, why would you? Why would you say? You said there Was a nagging lack of smiles When dancing on your back Tenderness a-plenty But that wasn't what you craved There's holes in hearts Desire starts to make demands And, dear boy, you'd be a fool To make your plans with her Why would you say sorry? Oh, why would you? Why would you say sorry? Oh, why would you say sorry? Oh, why would you? When it's just one of many bullets You will bite While waiting for a ray of light Waiting for a ray of light Waiting for a ray of light The paper cuts from the love letters You never gave him Could not meet your new found meat A misbehaving lie Why would you say sorry? Oh, why would you? Why would you say sorry? Oh, why would you say sorry? Oh, why would you?( Why would you?) Why would you say sorry?( Why would you?) Why would you say sorry?( Why would you?) Why would you say sorry?( Why would you?) Why would you say sorry?( Why would you?)( Why would you?)( Why would you?)( Why would you?)
