Did you believe them when they told you they discovered you?And that everything is free as long as you do what they tell you toYou think it's trueBut nothing could be farther from the truth, my loveDid you even listen when they told you to change your name?And how nobody wants honesty when looking at a perfect framePlay the gameBut nothing could be further from the truth, my loveAnd nothing is more powerful than beauty in a wicked worldPlay it girlPlay it girlPlay it girlDoes it make you feel good when they tell you what you want to hear?And after they suck all your soul, well, that's when they'll disappearDisappear forever, and everLike a prince in your little fairy taleAnd you will find, the day when they put your soul on saleThat nothing could be further from the truth, my loveAnd nothing is more powerful than beauty in a wicked world.
