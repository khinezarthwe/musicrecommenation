When I look into your eyesI can see a love restrainedBut darling, when I hold youDon't you know I feel the sameNothing lasts foreverAnd we both know hearts can changeAnd it's hard to hold a candleIn the cold November rainWe've been through this such a long, long timeJust trying to kill the pain, ooh yeahBut lovers always come and lovers always goAnd no one's really sure who's letting go today, walking awayIf we could take the time to lay it on the lineI could rest my head just knowing that you were mine, all mineSo if you want to love meThen darling, don't refrainOr I'll just end up walkingIn the cold November rainDo you need some time on your own?Do you need some time all alone?Ooh, everybody needs some time on their ownOoh, don't you know you need some time all alone?I know it's hard to keep an open heartWhen even friends seem out to harm youBut if you could heal a broken heartWouldn't time be out to charm you?Oh!Sometimes I need some time on my ownSometimes I need some time all aloneOoh, everybody needs some time on their ownOoh, don't you know you need some time all alone?And when your fears subsideAnd shadows still remainI know that you can love meWhen there's no one left to blameSo never mind the darknessWe still can find a wayNothing lasts foreverEven cold November rainDon't you think that you need somebody?Don't you think that you need someone?Everybody needs somebodyYou're not the only oneYou're not the only oneDon't you think that you need somebody?Don't you think that you need someone?Everybody needs somebodyYou're not the only oneYou're not the only oneDon't you think that you need somebody?Don't you think that you need someone?Everybody needs somebodyYou're not the only oneYou're not the only oneDon't you think that you need somebody?Don't you think that you need someone?Everybody needs somebody
