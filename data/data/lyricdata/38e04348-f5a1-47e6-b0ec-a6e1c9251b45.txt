It's been seven hours and fifteen daysSince you took your love awayI go out every night and sleep all daySince you took your love awaySince you been gone I can do whatever I wantI can see whomever I chooseI can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurantBut nothing, I said nothing can take away these blues'Cause nothing comparesNothing compares to youIt's been so lonely without you hereLike a bird without a songNothing can stop these lonely tears from fallingTell me baby, where did I go wrongI could put my arms around every boy I seeBut they'd only remind me of youI went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told meHe said,But he's a fool'Cause nothing comparesNothing compares to youAll the flowers that you planted mama, in the back yardAll died when you went awayI know that living with you baby was sometimes hardBut I'm willing to give it another tryNothing comparesNothing compares to youNothing comparesNothing compares to youNothing comparesNothing compares to you
