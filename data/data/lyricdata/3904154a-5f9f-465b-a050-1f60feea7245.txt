Flying over darkened skies the battle will callDistant angels crying in the eye of the stormAnd the world falls under the starlightShining from heavens belowLong years of pain and sorrow searching for moreCry for the touch of angels never beforeAnd the stars fall on the horizonOnwards and up through the painRide the wind and fight the demon, steel shining brightStanding together forever onward, flames burning strongHot wind in hell of pain and sorrow now and ever onwardsWe stare into the dawn of a new worldCry out for the fallen heroesLost in time agoIn our minds they still belongWhen the sands of time are goneRise over shadow mountains blazing with powerCrossing valleys, endless tears, in unity we standFar and wide across the land, the victory is oursOn towards the gates of reasonFight for the truth and the freedomGloriaSearching through the memories to open the doorLiving on the edge of life like never beforeAnd the crowd chants under the moonlight, facing their fears all the sameHeavens fear now open wide and up for the callAll in stark reality the angels will fallAnd the world cries out for the silence lost in the voices unknownBlinded by the force of evil, cries into the nightNever before have they seen the darkness, now they are all goneOut from the shadows storming on the wings of revelationsYour soul will feel no mercy come the dawnHold on for the morning afterNever to let goIn the fires burning strongWhen the tides of time roll onRise over shadow mountains blazing with powerCrossing valleys, endless tears, in unity we standFar and wide across the land, the victory is oursOn towards the gates of reasonFight for the truth and the freedomGloriaSolos: Herman/Twin/Sam/Herman/Twin/Twin Blast/Herman/Sam/Herman/SamWoh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohWoh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohWoh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohWoh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohCry out for the fallen heroesLost in time agoIn our minds they still belongWhen the sands of time are goneRise over shadow mountains blazing with powerCrossing valleys, endless tears, in unity we standFar and wide across the land, the victory is oursOn towards the gates of reasonFight for the truth and the freedomGloriaGloriaGloria
