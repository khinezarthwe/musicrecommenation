Flying over darkened skies the battle will call Distant angels crying in the eye of the storm And the world falls under the starlight Shining from heavens below Long years of pain and sorrow searching for more Cry for the touch of angels never before And the stars fall on the horizon Onwards and up through the pain Ride the wind and fight the demon, steel shining bright Standing together forever onward, flames burning strong Hot wind in hell of pain and sorrow now and ever onwards We stare into the dawn of a new world Cry out for the fallen heroes Lost in time ago In our minds they still belong When the sands of time are gone Rise over shadow mountains blazing with power Crossing valleys, endless tears, in unity we stand Far and wide across the land, the victory is ours On towards the gates of reason Fight for the truth and the freedom Gloria Searching through the memories to open the door Living on the edge of life like never before And the crowd chants under the moonlight, facing their fears all the same Heavens fear now open wide and up for the call All in stark reality the angels will fall And the world cries out for the silence lost in the voices unknown Blinded by the force of evil, cries into the night Never before have they seen the darkness, now they are all gone Out from the shadows storming on the wings of revelations Your soul will feel no mercy come the dawn Hold on for the morning after Never to let go In the fires burning strong When the tides of time roll on Rise over shadow mountains blazing with power Crossing valleys, endless tears, in unity we stand Far and wide across the land, the victory is ours On towards the gates of reason Fight for the truth and the freedom Gloria Solos: Herman/ Twin/ Sam/ Herman/ Twin/ Twin Blast/ Herman/ Sam/ Herman/ Sam Woh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Woh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Woh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Woh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Cry out for the fallen heroes Lost in time ago In our minds they still belong When the sands of time are gone Rise over shadow mountains blazing with power Crossing valleys, endless tears, in unity we stand Far and wide across the land, the victory is ours On towards the gates of reason Fight for the truth and the freedom Gloria Gloria Gloria
