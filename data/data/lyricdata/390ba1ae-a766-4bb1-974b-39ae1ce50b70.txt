Looking down on empty streets, all she can seeAre the dreams all made solidAre the dreams made realAll of the buildings, all of the carsWere once just a dreamIn somebody's headShe pictures the broken glass, pictures the steamShe pictures a soulWith no leak at the seamLet's take the boat outWait until darknessLet's take the boat outWait until darkness comesNowhere in the corridors of pale green and grayNowhere in the suburbsIn the cold light of dayThere in the midst of it, so alive and aloneWords support like boneDreaming of Mercy StreetWear your inside outDreaming of mercyIn your daddy's arms againDreaming of Mercy StreetSwear they moved that signDreaming of mercyIn your daddy's armsPulling out the papers from the drawers that slide smoothTugging at the darkness, word upon wordConfessing all the secret things in the warm velvet boxTo the priest, he's the doctorHe can handle the shocksDreaming of the tendernessThe tremble in the hipsOf kissing Mary's lipsDreaming of Mercy StreetWear your inside outDreaming of mercyIn your daddy's arms againDreaming of Mercy StreetSwear they moved that signLooking for mercyIn your daddy's armsMercy, mercy, looking for mercyLooking for mercyMercy, looking for mercyMercy, looking for mercyLooking for mercyOh, mercyLooking for mercyAnne, with her father, is out in the boatRiding the waterRiding the waves on the sea
