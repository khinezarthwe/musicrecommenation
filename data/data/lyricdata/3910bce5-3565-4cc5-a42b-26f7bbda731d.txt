Little deuce coupe, you don't know what I gotWell I'm not braggin' babe, so don't put me downBut I've got the fastest set of wheels in townWhen somethin' comes up to me, he don't even try'Cause if I had a set of wings, man, I know she could flyShe's my little deuce coupe, you don't know what I gotJust a little deuce coupe with a flat head millBut she'll walk a Thunderbird like she's standin' stillShe's ported and relieved and she's stroked and boredShe'll do a hundred and forty in the top end flooredShe's my little deuce coupe, you don't know what I gotShe's got a competition clutch with a four-on-the-floorAnd she purrs like a kitten 'til the Lake pipes roarAnd if that ain't enough to make you flip your lidThere's one more thing, I got the big slip, daddyAnd comin' off the line when the light turns greenWell she blows 'em outta the water like you never seenI get pushed out of shape and it's hard to steerWhen I get rubber in all four gearsShe's my little deuce coupe, you don't know what I gotShe's my little deuce coupe, you don't know what I gotShe's my little deuce coupe, you don't know what I gotShe's my little deuce coupe, you don't know what I got
