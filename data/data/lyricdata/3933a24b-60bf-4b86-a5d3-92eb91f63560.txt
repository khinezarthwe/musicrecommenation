Crazy... Stone cold crazy, yo! Hey! Walking down the street, shootin' people that I meet Fully loaded Tommy Gun Here come The Deputy... Try fucking gettin' me! Gotta' fucking get up and run They got the sirens loose I ran right out of juice They're gonna' put me in a cell If I can't go to Heaven... Let me go to Hell! Crazy... Stone cold crazy, ya' know!
