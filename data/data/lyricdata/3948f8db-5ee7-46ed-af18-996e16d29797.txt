The lazy way they turned your headInto a rest stop for the deadAnd did it all in gold and blue and greyThe efforts to allay your dreadIn spite of all you knew and saidWere hard to see and harder still to sayA comfort plush all laced in leadWas sent to quell your sentimentAnd keep your trembling sentinel hand at bayAnd when a sudden silhouetteEscaped the top-side of your bedI knew you'd never ever be the sameOh, is it not me?Am I not folded by your touch?The words you spokeI know too muchIt's over nowAnd not enoughOh, is it not me?The damage you hold inside your blush?The load you towedYou showed it upIt's over nowAnd I'm insaneWild spirits winds from out your chestCollides with world and wildernessIt needs a gentle hand to call it homeNow surfs the sun and scales the moonAnd winds the waistband of her wombAll eyes ablaze the day you break your moldOh, is it not me?Am I not culled into your clutch?The words you spokeI know too muchWe're closer nowAnd said enoughOh, is it not me?Am I not rolled into your crush?The road you choseUnloads controlSee it take me soGo on throw this stoneInto this halfway home
