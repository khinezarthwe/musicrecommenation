Fine white sheep and candles tooBets in a straight row, one each for youNo one talks straight at you just outside the hallwayFlowers in the window, red and blueMost people here still think of youNo bleeding eyes, and they passBang your head, against the glassWhat can I do, I am losing youWhat can I do, I am losing youWhat can I do, I am losing youWhat can I do, I am losing youFrom the doorway watching you sleepBefore you wake up, not when you eatKeep it straight, wipe your mouthKeep it down, boys don't shoutWhat can I do, I am losing youWhat can I do, I am losing youWhat can I do, I am losing youWhat can I do, I am losing youFrom the doorway watching you sleepBefore you wake up, not when you eatKeep it straight, wipe your mouthKeep it down, boys don't shoutWhat can I do, I am losing youWhat can I do, I am losing youWhat can I do, I am losing youWhat can I do, I am losing you
