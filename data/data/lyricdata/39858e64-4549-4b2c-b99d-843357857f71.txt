I remember it well, the first time that I saw Your head 'round the door' Cause mine stopped working I remember it well, there was wet in your hair I was stood in the stair And time stopped moving I want you here tonight, I want you here' Cause I can't believe what I found I want you here tonight, want you here Nothing is taking me down, down, down I remember it well, taxied out of the storm To watch you perform And my ships were sailing I remember it well, I was stood in your line And your mouth, your mouth, your mind Want you here tonight, want you here' Cause I can't believe what I found I want you here tonight, want you here Nothing is taking me down, down, down' Cept you my love' Cept you my love Come all ye lost Dive into moss And hope that my sanity covers the cost To remove the stain of my love Paper mach√© Come all ye reborn Blow off my horn I'm driving real hard This is love, this is porn God would forgive me But I, I whip myself scorn, scorn And I wanna hear what you have to say about me Hear if you're gonna live without me I wanna hear what you want I remember December And I wanna hear what you have to say about me Hear if you're gonna live without me I wanna hear what you want What the hell do you want?
