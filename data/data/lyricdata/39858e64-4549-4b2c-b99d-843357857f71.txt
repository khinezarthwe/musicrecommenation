I remember it well, the first time that I sawYour head 'round the door'Cause mine stopped workingI remember it well, there was wet in your hairI was stood in the stairAnd time stopped movingI want you here tonight, I want you here'Cause I can't believe what I foundI want you here tonight, want you hereNothing is taking me down, down, downI remember it well, taxied out of the stormTo watch you performAnd my ships were sailingI remember it well, I was stood in your lineAnd your mouth, your mouth, your mindWant you here tonight, want you here'Cause I can't believe what I foundI want you here tonight, want you hereNothing is taking me down, down, down'Cept you my love'Cept you my loveCome all ye lostDive into mossAnd hope that my sanity covers the costTo remove the stain of my lovePaper mach√©Come all ye rebornBlow off my hornI'm driving real hardThis is love, this is pornGod would forgive meBut I, I whip myself scorn, scornAnd I wanna hear what you have to say about meHear if you're gonna live without meI wanna hear what you wantI remember DecemberAnd I wanna hear what you have to say about meHear if you're gonna live without meI wanna hear what you wantWhat the hell do you want?
