Grab my knee andlook at me and try to tell meI'll be home soonAsleep in my bed and unstonedI'm tired of me this wayI don't know what I've gotten intoBut I'm glad that it's now instead of soonerThis desert heat has crowded me strongWith a wish that I had for winterIt's not as gentle as it soundsAs though is sounded yesterdayWhen I heard a leaf of my life hit the groundAs a bottle cap flew from my fingersI don't know what I've gotten intoBut I'm glad that it's now instead of soonerThis desert heat has crowded me strongWith a wish that I had for winter...and the sand blew in my eyesAs I stood on the edge and looked down to seeThe light of a new life shining up on meI don't know what I've gotten intoBut I'm glad that it's now instead of soonerThis desert heat has crowded me strongWith a wish that I had for winter...and the sand blew in my eyes
