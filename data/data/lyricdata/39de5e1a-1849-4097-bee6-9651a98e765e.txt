Memphis comes creeping down my backSomehow this place tastes just like an attackA hundred-yard-stare of a kissLord, I know I'll never miss itThey told me start scouting the fieldThey told me how to look in Commercial AppealAnd start getting that hair cut sharpSometimes I think that I'll find a loveOne that's gonna change my heartI'll find it in Commercial AppealAnd then this heartache'll get chased awayI was part-time at the Tasty PrawnThat and moving furniture and cutting lawnsCovered in newsprint, staying up real lateJust holding out for some fateSometimes I think that I'll find a loveOne that's gonna change my heartI'll find it in Commercial AppealAnd then this heartache'll get chased awaySometimes I think that I'll find a loveOne that's gonna change my heartI'll find it in Commercial AppealAnd then this heartache'll get chased awayI was dreaming in the driver's seatWhen the right words just came to meAnd all my finer feelings came upAlways out on some witch's huntFor the one who never lets me wantBefore you know it it's all fussSometimes I think that I'll find a loveOne that's gonna change my heartI'll find it in Commercial AppealAnd then this heartache'll get chased awaySometimes I think that I'll find a loveOne that's gonna change my heartI'll find it in Commercial AppealAnd then this heartache'll get chased away
