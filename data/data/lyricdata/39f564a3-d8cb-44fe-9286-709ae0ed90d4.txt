If I made it through Christmas without smoking'Til your parents went to bedIf you made it through tooWithout sticking your nail scissors in my neckI'll buy you bras instead of pickled eggsChocolate instead of chutneyGood red wine instead of bad red wineNext time I remember your birthdayI ate peaches straight from the canThe juice ran down my tongueOver my lipSlipped down my chinDripped onto your parents' carpetThe air in here is deadBut we're not finished yetThrow the back door openLet me see your breathI love you like a madmanI miss you all the timeI wait for the morningI will wait all nightI mixed rum and coke and lemonadeAsked for my presents in the kitchenAlone again at 3amI listened to themWith sugar round the rim and ash around the edgesOf the tiles and the tablesYou didn't sit up waitingBut somehow slept sober
