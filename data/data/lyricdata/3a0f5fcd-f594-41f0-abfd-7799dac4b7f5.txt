I wrote this songyears agolate at nightsomewhere on the Goldhawk RoadI was never sure how or whyBefore the warand the tidal waveengulfed us all it's truehow the world has changedAnd I was learning how to change with youWe saw the green fieldsTurn into stoneSuch lonely homesAll in a badman's dreamHe ain't asleepIt's just a dreamIn the darkest hourthe song had goneit passed among the peopleI hardly knewI was losing it all the timeBut she stayed with meand found me outand above all things I've learntIt's that honestythat secures the bond in the heartWe saw the green fieldsTurn into stoneSuch lonely homesAll in a badman's dreamHe ain't asleepIt's just a dream
