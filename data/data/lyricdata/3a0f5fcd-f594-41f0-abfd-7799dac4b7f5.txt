I wrote this songyears agolate at nightsomewhere on the Goldhawk Road I was never sure how or why Before the warand the tidal waveengulfed us all it's truehow the world has changed And I was learning how to change with you We saw the green fields Turn into stone Such lonely homes All in a badman's dream He ain't asleep It's just a dream In the darkest hourthe song had goneit passed among the people I hardly knew I was losing it all the time But she stayed with meand found me outand above all things I've learnt It's that honestythat secures the bond in the heart We saw the green fields Turn into stone Such lonely homes All in a badman's dream He ain't asleep It's just a dream
