I don't put a smile upon your face no more I can't make your heart shine like it did before You don't listen to my stories anymore You can't comfort me the way you did before Was I too loud? Was I too bad? Was I too open? Was I too high? Was I too fast? Was I too close? I don't feel your lips like the first kiss I'd rather run away, than sit to face the truth Was I too proud? Was I too hopeful? Was I too needing? Was I too crazy? Was I too long? Was I too giving? No matter how far, no matter how long - I will be there No matter how far, no matter how long - I will be there No matter how far, no matter how long - I will be there No matter how far, no matter how long - I will be there
