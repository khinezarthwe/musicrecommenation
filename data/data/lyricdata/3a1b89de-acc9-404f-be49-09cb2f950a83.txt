I don't put a smile upon your face no moreI can't make your heart shine like it did beforeYou don't listen to my stories anymoreYou can't comfort me the way you did beforeWas I too loud? Was I too bad? Was I too open?Was I too high? Was I too fast? Was I too close?I don't feel your lips like the first kissI'd rather run away, than sit to face the truthWas I too proud? Was I too hopeful? Was I too needing?Was I too crazy? Was I too long? Was I too giving?No matter how far, no matter how long - I will be thereNo matter how far, no matter how long - I will be thereNo matter how far, no matter how long - I will be thereNo matter how far, no matter how long - I will be there
