Athena, she's not a man or boy She's is a 'survisa' These guns are fighting for Athena, she offers frozen shine She taught me how to make Make my lost reflex show How are your born with wisdom I look at every face The way ours a gentile kiss I look for the same thing Athena, not perfect but so strong War is in her own heart Singing a woman's song Athena, with her now she can give To the battles of the light She's strong enough to win How are your born with wisdom I look at every face The way ours a gentile kiss I look for the same thing How are your born with wisdom I look at every face The way ours a gentile kiss I look for the same thing How are your born with wisdom I look at every face The way ours a gentile kiss I look for the same thing
