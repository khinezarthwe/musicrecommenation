I would tell you about the things they put me throughThe pain I've been subjected toBut the Lord himself, oh, would blushThe countless feasts laid at my feetForbidden fruits for me to eatBut I think your pulse would start to rushNow I'm not looking for absolutionForgiveness for the things I doBut before you come to any conclusionsTry walking in my shoesTry walking in my shoesYou'll stumble in my footstepsKeep the same appointments I keptIf you try walking in my shoesIf you try walking in my shoesMorality would frown uponDecency look down uponThe scapegoat fate's made of meBut I promise now, my judge and jurorsMy intentions couldn't have been purerMy case is easy to seeI'm not looking for a clearer consciencePeace of mind after what I've been throughAnd before we talk of any repentanceTry walking in my shoesTry walking in my shoesYou'll stumble in my footstepsKeep the same appointments I keptIf you try walking in my shoesIf you try walking in my shoesTry walking in my shoesNow I'm not looking for absolutionForgiveness for the things I doBut before you come to any conclusionsTry walking in my shoesTry walking in my shoesYou'll stumble in my footstepsKeep the same appointments I keptIf you try walking in my shoesYou'll stumble in my footstepsKeep the same appointments I keptIf you try walking in my shoesTry walking in my shoesIf you try walking in my shoesTry walking in my shoes
