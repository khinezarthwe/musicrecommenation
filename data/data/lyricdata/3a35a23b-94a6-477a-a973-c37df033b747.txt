Oh!There goes my valentine againSoaked in red for what she saidAnd now she's goneOh my god, have I done it again?There's a pulse and it's deafeningI can't help what I hear in my headIt's the switch that I flick (when he says)Hand of bloodI don't wanna feelMy heart is breakingHand of bloodI don't wanna seeMy life is burningI saw you look awayIs what you've seen too much to takeOr are you blind and seeing nothing?I saw you run, I saw you run awayIs what I've done too much to takeOr are you scared of being nothing?There's a stain on my hand and it's redOh my god, am I losing it?I can't help what I've done or I saidIt's the buttons I push (when he says)Hand of bloodI don't wanna feelMy heart is breakingHand of bloodI don't wanna seeMy life is burningI saw you look awayIs what you've seen too much to takeOr are you blind and seeing nothing?I saw you run, I saw you run awayIs what I've done too much to takeOr are you scared of being nothing?Oh!I saw you look awayIs what you've seen too much to takeOr are you blind and seeing nothing?I saw you run, I saw you run awayIs what I've done too much to takeOr are you scared of being nothing?
