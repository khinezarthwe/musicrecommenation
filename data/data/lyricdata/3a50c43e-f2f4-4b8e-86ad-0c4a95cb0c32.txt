I've become impossibleHolding on to whenWhen everything seemed to matter moreThe two of usAll used and beaten upWatching fate as it flowsDown the path we have choseYou and meWe're in this together nowNone of them can stop us nowWe will make it through somehowYou and meIf the world should break in twoUntil the very end of meUntil the very end of youAwake to the soundAs they peel apart the skinThey pick and they pullTrying to get their fingers inWell, they've got to kill what we've foundWell, they've got to hate what they fearWell, they've got to make it go awayWell, they've got to make it disappearThe further I fall I'm beside youAs lost as I get I will find youThe deeper the wound, I'm inside youForever and ever I am a part ofYou and meWe're in this together nowNone of them can stop us nowWe will make it through somehowYou and meIf the world should break in twoUntil the very end of meUntil the very end of youThe world is gone, we have to hold onThe world is gone, we have to hold onThe world is gone, we have to hold onThe world is gone, but we can hold onYou and meWe're in this together nowNone of them can stop us nowWe will make it through somehowYou and meEven after everythingYou're the queen and I'm the kingNothing else means anything
