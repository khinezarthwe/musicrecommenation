I've become impossible Holding on to when When everything seemed to matter more The two of us All used and beaten up Watching fate as it flows Down the path we have chose You and me We're in this together now None of them can stop us now We will make it through somehow You and me If the world should break in two Until the very end of me Until the very end of you Awake to the sound As they peel apart the skin They pick and they pull Trying to get their fingers in Well, they've got to kill what we've found Well, they've got to hate what they fear Well, they've got to make it go away Well, they've got to make it disappear The further I fall I'm beside you As lost as I get I will find you The deeper the wound, I'm inside you Forever and ever I am a part of You and me We're in this together now None of them can stop us now We will make it through somehow You and me If the world should break in two Until the very end of me Until the very end of you The world is gone, we have to hold on The world is gone, we have to hold on The world is gone, we have to hold on The world is gone, but we can hold on You and me We're in this together now None of them can stop us now We will make it through somehow You and me Even after everything You're the queen and I'm the king Nothing else means anything
