Can you feel me comingOpen the door it's only meI have that desperate feelingTrouble is where I'm going to beI know you hear me knockingSo open the door and set me freeIf there's a kingdom behind it allIs there a God that loves us allDo we believe in love at allI'm still pretending I'm not a foolSo in your infinite wisdomShow me how this life should beAll your love and gloryDoesn't mean that much to meIf there's a kingdom behind it allIs there a God that loves us allDo we believe in love at allI'm still pretending I'm not a fool
