(Gary Rossington, Johnny Van-Zant, Ed King, Donnie Van Zant)There's an old man sittin' on a front porch nowTalkin' 'bout how it used to beWhen I was young I was a hell of a manMy father died when I was tenI hit the road to find a jobHad to feed my familyTimes were hard my hands are still scarredFrom the life I've had to leadI was born to runDrove a tractor and trailer all my lifeSix kids and a hell of a wifeMade lots of money it all slipped awayA large family that's the price you payI always dreamed never gave upSon, even when times got toughThat's when I'd push it a little bit moreYou should've heard that engine roar(chorus)I was born to runCan't slow downNo regrets, I've been blessedBorn to runIn time you'll see what the good Lord's done for meBorn to runI can't slow downNo regrets, I did my bestBorn to runIn time you'll seeWhat the good Lord's done, done for meThe old man, he passed awayAnd all he said never crossed my mindUntil I saw the price he payedWas a lot like mineI'm full and though it's miles awayGotta hit the city right on timeAnd when I'm on I'll always sing little song of mineI was born to run(repeat chorus)
