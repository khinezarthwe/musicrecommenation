Death by chocolate is mythThis I know because I livedI've been around for broken hearts and howLay your head in my hands little girlThis is only right nowDeath by crying doesn't existThough the headaches feel a bit like itYou might explodeBut you reach the end of the roadAnd you, little treeI'm certain you will growTears on your pillow will dry and you will learnJust how to love againOh, my weeping willow let your leaves fall and returnOh, darling the seasons are your friendDeath by anger this is trueOh, just let him go, he can't hurt youOh little girl, this is such a cruel, cruel worldThis is the first of a million broken heartsTears on your pillow will dry and you will learnJust how to love againOh, my weeping willow let your leaves fall and returnOh, darling the seasons are your friendOh, it won't be long, you will grow strongUp, up and awayOh, it won't be long, you will grow strongUp, up and awayOh, it won't be long, you will grow strongUp, up and awayOh, it won't be long, you will grow strongUp, up and awayOh, it won't be long, you will grow strongUp, up and awayOh, it won't be long you will grow strongUp, up and awayHe's but a falling leafHe's but a falling leafHe's but a falling leaf
