My secret love Keeps me awake at night My secret love of the man My secret fight They put you down They pushed your face down They fucked you aver and around You kissed the ground Oh raise me up I forgot to dance your name Oh raise me up I will never dance again[ Repeat: x4] Before I dance again You're the one I waited for your return I slept with rocks I slept with stones Stone was my home Energy Life danced right out of me When my father busted you free He also killed me Oh raise me up To dance upon your head Oh raise me up To dance in the holes of your head[ Repeat in background] Oh raise me up To dance in the cavities of Your eyes
