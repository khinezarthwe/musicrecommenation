My secret loveKeeps me awake at nightMy secret love of the manMy secret fightThey put you downThey pushed your face downThey fucked you aver and aroundYou kissed the groundOh raise me upI forgot to dance your nameOh raise me upI will never dance again[Repeat: x4]Before I dance againYou're the oneI waited for your returnI slept with rocksI slept with stonesStone was my homeEnergyLife danced right out of meWhen my father busted you freeHe also killed meOh raise me upTo dance upon your headOh raise me upTo dance in the holes of your head[Repeat in background]Oh raise me upTo dance in the cavities ofYour eyes
