Transmission, Third World War, third roundA decade of the weapon of sound above groundAin't no shelter if you're looking for shadeI lick shots at the brutal charadeAs the polls close like a casketOur truth devours a silent play in the shadow of powerA spectacle monopolizedThe camera's eyes on choice disguisedWas it cast for the mass who burn and toil?Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?It's a spectacle monopolizedThey hold the reins, stole your eyesThe Fistagon's bullets and bombsWho stuff the banks, who staff the party ranksMore for Gore or the son of a drug lord?None of the above, fuck it, cut the cordLights out, guerrilla radioTurn that shit upLights out, guerrilla radioTurn that shit upLights out, guerrilla radioTurn that shit upLights out, guerrilla radioContact, I hijack the frequenciesBlockin' the Beltway, move on D.
