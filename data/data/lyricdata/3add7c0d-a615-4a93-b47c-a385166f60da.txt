Early one mornin' while makin' the roundsI took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman downI went right home and I went to bedI stuck that lovin' .44 beneath my headGot up next mornin' and I grabbed that gunTook a shot of cocaine and away I runMade a good run but I run too slowThey overtook me down in Juarez, MexicoLate in the hot joints takin' the pillsIn walked the sheriff from Jericho HillHe said Willy Lee your name is not Jack BrownYou're the dirty heck that shot your woman downSaid yes, oh yes my name is Willy LeeIf you've got a warrant just a-read it to meShot her down because she made me slowI thought I was her daddy but she had five moreWhen I was arrested I was dressed in blackThey put me on a train and they took me backHad no friend for to go my bailThey slapped my dried up carcass in that county jailEarly next mornin' bout a half past nineI spied the sheriff coming down the lineUp then he coughed as he cleared his throatHe said, "Come on you dirty heck into that district court"Into the courtroom my trial beganWhere I was handled by twelve honest menJust before the jury started outI saw that little judge commence to look aboutIn about five minutes in walked the manHolding the verdict in his right handThe verdict read in the first degreeI hollered, "Lawdy Lawdy, have mercy on me"The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen99 years in the Folsom pen99 years underneath that groundI can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch downCome on you've gotta listen unto meLay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be
