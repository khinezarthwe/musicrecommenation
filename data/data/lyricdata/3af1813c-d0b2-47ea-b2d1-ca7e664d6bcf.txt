Feel I'm on the verge of some greath truthWhere I'm finally in my placeBut I'm fumbling still for proofAnd it's cluttering my spaceCasting shadows on my faceI know I have the strength to move a hillBut I can hardly leave my roomSo I'll sit here perfecty stillAnd I'll listen for a tuneWhen the mind is on the moonAnd if I stumbleAnd if I stallAnd if I slip nowAnd if I should fallAnd if I cant be all that I could beWill you, will you wait for meCause everywhere I seem to beI am only passing throughI dream these days about the seaAlways wake up feeling blueWishing I could dream of youSo if I stumbleAnd if I fallAnd if I slip nowAnd loose it allAnd if I can't be all that I could beWill you, will you wait for meAnd wait for meAnd wait for meAnd wait for meWon't you wait for meAnd wait for mePlease wait for mePlease wait for meWon't you wait for meAnd wait for mePlease wait for mePlease wait for meWon't you wait for meAnd wait for mePlease wait for mePlease wait for meWon't you wait for meAnd wait for mePlease wait for mePlease wait for meWon't you wait for mePlease wait for mePlease wait for mePlease wait for meWon't you wait for me
