I met a girl; snowball in HellShe was scarred and as cracked as the Liberty bellI got her to come on, move in with meAnd I said I'd find a better place we could spend eternityDon't go downDon't go downStay with me, baby, stayHer momma called me a thiefAnd her dad called himself Commander in ChiefI fought him off with my loveBut I knew the sense of worthlessness she'd have to rise aboveDon't go downDon't go downStay with me, baby, stayDon't go downDon't go downStay with me, baby, stayShe had a dream; woke up in shockShe had seen her own body outlined in chalkAnd I split the scene; the globe's been spunAnd her ghost beamed down to kiss me with a message from the SunDon't go downDon't go downStay with me, baby, stayDon't go downStay with me, baby, stayDon't go downStay with me, baby, stayStayStayStay
