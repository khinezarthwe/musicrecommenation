I met a girl; snowball in Hell She was scarred and as cracked as the Liberty bell I got her to come on, move in with me And I said I'd find a better place we could spend eternity Don't go down Don't go down Stay with me, baby, stay Her momma called me a thief And her dad called himself Commander in Chief I fought him off with my love But I knew the sense of worthlessness she'd have to rise above Don't go down Don't go down Stay with me, baby, stay Don't go down Don't go down Stay with me, baby, stay She had a dream; woke up in shock She had seen her own body outlined in chalk And I split the scene; the globe's been spun And her ghost beamed down to kiss me with a message from the Sun Don't go down Don't go down Stay with me, baby, stay Don't go down Stay with me, baby, stay Don't go down Stay with me, baby, stay Stay Stay Stay
