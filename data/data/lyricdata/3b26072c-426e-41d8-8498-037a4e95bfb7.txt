I saw you this morningYou were moving so fastCan't seem to loosen my gripOn the pastAnd I miss you so muchThere's no one in sightAnd we're still making loveIn my secret lifeI smile when I'm angryI cheat and I lieI do what I have to doTo get byBut I know what is wrongAnd I know what is rightAnd I'd die for the truthIn my secret lifeHold on, hold on, my brotherMy sister, hold on tightI finally got my ordersI'll be marching through the morningMarching through the nightMoving cross the bordersOf my secret lifeLooked through the paperMakes you want to cryNobody cares if the peopleLive or dieAnd the dealer wants you thinkingThat it's either black or whiteThank God it's not that simpleIn my secret lifeI bite my lipI buy what I'm toldFrom the latest hitTo the wisdom of oldBut I'm always aloneAnd my heart is like iceAnd it's crowded and coldIn my secret life
