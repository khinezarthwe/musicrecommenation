I lived a quiet life A stranger to champagne I never dared to venture out To cities of the plain I'd heard about their way of life Took it with a pinch of salt The freedom and the time to play A life so easy It intrigued me When you called to say:" Are you gonna go To the Sodom and Gomorrah Show? It's got everything you need for your complete Entertainment and instruction Sun, sex, sin, divine intervention, Death and destruction The Sodom and Gomorrah show Is a once-in-a-lifetime production" I think it's true to say My life was changed that night In the liberated Atmosphere All around me Someone found me Whispered in my ear" Are you gonna go To the Sodom and Gomorrah Show? It's got everything you need for your complete Entertainment and instruction Sun, sex, sin, divine intervention, Death and destruction The Sodom and Gomorrah Show Is a once-in-a-lifetime production" Then we went on After-hours There was place down below It was there I realised The meaning of the show You've got to love To learn to live Where angels fear to tread I did it and I don't regret the day Even now I think of how You turned to me to say" Are you gonna go To the Sodom and Gomorrah Show? It's got everything you need for your complete Entertainment and instruction Sun, sex, sin, divine intervention, Death and destruction The Sodom and Gomorrah Show Is a once-in-a-lifetime production"
