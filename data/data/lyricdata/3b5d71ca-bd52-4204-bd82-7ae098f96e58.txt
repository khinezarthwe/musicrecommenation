When you hide next to me With your eyes up close to me I hear footsteps in the dark When you hijack my heart Cool breeze down the hall I can feel you breathe Outside my door Bang bang bang On the wall From dusk ' til dawn Do do do do Do do do do Bang bang bang On the wall From dusk ' til dawn Do do do do Do do do do Bang bang bang On the wall From dusk ' til dawn When you sense you're not alone And the darkness starts to moan Who's there? Shadows all around But you don't make a sound Voices in my head Playing like an echo, echo Bang bang bang On the wall From dusk ' til dawn Do do do do Do do do do
