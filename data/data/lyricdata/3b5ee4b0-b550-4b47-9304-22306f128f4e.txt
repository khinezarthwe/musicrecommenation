Give me two strong arms to fight my enemiesGive me two strong eyes to see the truthGive me two strong legs I think I have to runAnd fill my heart will faith that I won't loseI don't wanna loseGive me one real love that I don't freeze out thereMake me feel your presence in the nightGive me one strong heart that tells me when I lieAnd take my soul so I won't have to hideI don't wanna hideit's so cold deep down hereI know we had to fallSouls are dying everywhereBut whatever I do I believe(Solo)There'll be no reason to liveWithout you giving me lightThere is so much that you giveYour love is shining so brightI believe...I wanna love but I always hateI wanna give but I always takeWant you to laugh but I make you cryNo I won't change until I dieIt's so much easier said than doneI know I can't just always runGot so much anger inside of meI understand but I think I see what I'm notI know it's true what J.C. saidI got it all clear in my headSeems we were born to be unfairI am a sinner that's starting to dare to believeGive me your hand until the endAnd I will walk into the promised landI don't deserve anything you doBut I can't stop loving youNo more lies, no false religionsNo more whys and wrong God missionsNo shiny TV priests begging for cashNo more wars that no God's never asked forThere's a way back out of hereOne day we're going homeTell everyone who wants to hearWhatever you do:Do believe, I believe, we believe, believe oh!
