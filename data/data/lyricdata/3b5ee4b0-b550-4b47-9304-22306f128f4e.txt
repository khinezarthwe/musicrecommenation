Give me two strong arms to fight my enemies Give me two strong eyes to see the truth Give me two strong legs I think I have to run And fill my heart will faith that I won't lose I don't wanna lose Give me one real love that I don't freeze out there Make me feel your presence in the night Give me one strong heart that tells me when I lie And take my soul so I won't have to hide I don't wanna hideit's so cold deep down here I know we had to fall Souls are dying everywhere But whatever I do I believe( Solo) There'll be no reason to live Without you giving me light There is so much that you give Your love is shining so bright I believe... I wanna love but I always hate I wanna give but I always take Want you to laugh but I make you cry No I won't change until I die It's so much easier said than done I know I can't just always run Got so much anger inside of me I understand but I think I see what I'm not I know it's true what J. C. said I got it all clear in my head Seems we were born to be unfair I am a sinner that's starting to dare to believe Give me your hand until the end And I will walk into the promised land I don't deserve anything you do But I can't stop loving you No more lies, no false religions No more whys and wrong God missions No shiny T V priests begging for cash No more wars that no God's never asked for There's a way back out of here One day we're going home Tell everyone who wants to hear Whatever you do: Do believe, I believe, we believe, believe oh!
