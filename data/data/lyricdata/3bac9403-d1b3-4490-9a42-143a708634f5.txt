Once you're lostIn twilight's blueYou don't find your wayThe way finds youTempt the fatesBeware the smileIt hides all the teeth, my dearAnd what's behind themSo glad you could stay foreverSo glad you could stay foreverSo glad you could stay foreverSo glad you could stay foreverHe steps between the treesA crooked manThere's blood on the bladeDon't take his handYou warm by the firelightIn twilight's blueShadows creep and dance the wallsHe's creeping, tooSo glad you could stay foreverSo glad you could stay foreverSo glad you could stay foreverSo glad you could stay foreverSo glad you could staySo glad you couldSo gladSo glad you could staySo glad you could stay forever
