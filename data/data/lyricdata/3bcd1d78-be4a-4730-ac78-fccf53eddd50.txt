You may tire of me as our December sun is setting'Cause I'm not who I used to beNo longer easy on the eyesBut these wrinkles masterfully disguiseThe youthful boy belowWho turned your way and sawSomething he was not looking forBoth a beginning and an endBut now he lives inside someone he does not recognizeWhen he catches his reflection on accidentOn the back of a motor bikeWith your arms outstretched trying to take flightLeaving everything behindBut even at our swiftest speedWe couldn't break from the concreteIn the city where we still resideAnd I have learned that even landlocked lovers yearnFor the sea like navy men'Cause now we say goodnightFrom our own separate sidesLike brothers on a hotel bedLike brothers on a hotel bedLike brothers on a hotel bedLike brothers on a hotel bedYou may tire of me as our December sun is setting'Cause I'm not who I used to be
