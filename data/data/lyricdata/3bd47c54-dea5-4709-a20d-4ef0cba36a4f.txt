It's the same old story all over again You turn a lover into just another friend I want to love you, I want to make you mine Won't you lay it on the line I'm tired of playing foolish games I'm tired of all of your lies making me insane I don't ask for much, the truth will do just fine Won't you lay it on the line Lay it on the line Lay it on the line Lay it on the line Don't waste my time You got no right to make me wait We better talk, girl, before it gets too late I never, ever thought you could be so unkind Won't you lay it on the line Lay it on the line Lay it on the line Lay it on the line Don't waste my time You know I love you (you know I love you), you know it's true (you know it's true) It's up to you, girl, now what have I got to do Don't hold me up, girl, don't waste my precious time Won't you lay it on the line Lay it on the line Lay it on the line (lay it on the line) Lay it on the line (don't hold me up, girl) Lay it on the line Lay it on the line (lay it on the line, girl) Lay it on the line (no, don't hold me up) Lay it on the line (lay it on the line) Lay it on the line Lay it on the line
