Raindrops are falling on my headAnd just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bedNothing seems to fitThose raindrops are falling on my head, they keep fallingSo I just did me some talking to the sunAnd I said I didn't like the way he got things doneHe's sleeping on the jobThose raindrops are falling on my head, they keep fallin'But there's one thing I knowThe blues they send to meet meWon't defeat meIt won't be long 'till happiness steps up to greet meRaindrops keep falling on my headBut that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning redCrying's not for me'Cause, I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainingBecause I'm freeNothing's worrying meIt won't be long 'till happiness steps up to greet meRaindrops keep falling on my headBut that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning redCrying's not for me, 'cause,I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainingBecause I'm freeNothing's worrying me
