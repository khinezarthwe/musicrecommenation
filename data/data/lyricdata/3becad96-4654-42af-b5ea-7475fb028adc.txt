I've lost my battle before it startsMy first breath wasn't doneMy spirit's sunken deepInto the groundWhy am I aloneI can hear my heartbeatSilence's all aroundSee hate will riseSo don't come closerFear your childBorn with a king's heartBut fate fooled meAnd changed my cardsNo one asked if I want itIf I like itPain inside is risingI am the fallen oneA figure in an old gameNo Jokers on my sideI plunged into miseryI'll turn off the lightAnd murder the dawnTurn off the lightAnd murder the dawnNothing else,But laughter is around meForevermoreNo one can heal meNothing can save meNo one can heal meI've gone beyond the truthIt's just another lieWash away the blood on my handsMy father's bloodIn agony we're unifiedI never wanted to beWhat they told me to beFulfill my fate then I'll be freeGod knows how longI tried to change fatePain inside is risingI am the fallen oneA figure in an old gameNo Jokers on my sideI plunged into miseryI'll turn off the lightAnd murder the dawnTurn off the lightAnd murder the dawnI plunged into miseryI'll turn off the lightAnd murder the dawnTurn off the lightAnd murder the dawn
