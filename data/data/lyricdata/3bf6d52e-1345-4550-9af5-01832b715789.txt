Lucy, rememberThe smell of that fallThe fires of fungusAnd the rotting leavesI fell off the wagonInto your armsInto this long month of sundaysAnd you were my husbandMy wife, my heroinNow this is our final DecemberNow deep in a forestLosing all thought of springAnd nothing can help me rememberAnd I'm going nowhere fastA darker day has holed at lastDeep in a dream I set the calmness to spinningAnd your love has come too lateAway from the garden gateWake me up when the blue bells are ringingHow can it be over after all that we had, now comesA river runs through the rafters down, down, downDoes it leave me sleeping? Dreaming only of springThe phone rings out and I rememberBut I'm going nowhere fastThe darker days has holed at lastDeep in this dream I let the compass keep spinningAnd your love has come too lateNow wave to the garden gateWake me up when the blue bells are ringingRinging, ringing, ringingWanna hear them ringing, my loveWanna hear them ringingRinging...
