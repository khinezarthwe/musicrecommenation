You can fight the fire that's in your headLay it down, the hour has come to endWalk around without her just for a bitLooking back upon the way things had beenMan, I've been wasting so much timeWalking the same street every nightDon't you think maybe it's about time?You can light the fire that's in your headPut it off, tomorrow will come insteadWe don't watch the tower that tells us whenPull the wicked flower out from its bedMan's been wasting so much timeSending the children out to fightDon't you think maybe it's about time?
