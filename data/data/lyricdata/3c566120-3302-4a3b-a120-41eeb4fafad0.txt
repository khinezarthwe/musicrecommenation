Out on the wall sounds of bangingIs constant, coming from your headAnd desperate the calls came in ringingFrom those who wanna wring your neckYour neckOpen your mouth, sounds of breathingFound it spilling from your faceBest to be dim to the humbling trafficStomping on your nameCount on us allFalling on our own swords tonightA chilling walk home down the portions of roads thereLeading straight to your placeIt looked like the tin can would swallowThe kitchen plugging up your spaceCount on us allStepping on our own toes tonightCount on us allStepping on our own toesCount on us allFalling on our own swords tonight
