I don't care if you won'tTalk to meYou know I'm not that kind of girl.And I don't care if you won'tWalk with meIt don't give me such a thrill.And I don't care about the way you lookYou should know I'm not impressed'Cause there's just one thingThat I'm looking forAnd he don't wear a dress.I need a man...I need a man...Baby baby babyDon't you shave your legsDon't you double comb your hairDon't powder puffJust leave it roughI like your fingers bare.When the night comes downI can turn it roundI can take you anywhere.I don't need loveForget that stuffYou know that I don't careI need a man...I need a man...I don't need a heartbreakerFifty-faced trouble makerTwo timing time takerDirty little money makerMuscle bound cheap skateLow down woman haterTriple crossing double daterYella bellied alligator...I don't care if you won'tTalk to meYou know I'm not that kind of girl.And I don't care if you won'tWalk with meIt don't give me such a thrill.And I don't care about the way you lookYou should know I'm not impressed'Cause there's just one thingThat I'm looking forAnd he don't wear a dress.
