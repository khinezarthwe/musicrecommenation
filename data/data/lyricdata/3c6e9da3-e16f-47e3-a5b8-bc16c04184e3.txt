He sewed his eyes shut because he is afraid to seeHe tries to tell me what I put inside of meHe's got the answers to ease my curiosityHe dreamed a god up and called it ChristianityYour god is dead and no one caresIf there is a Hell I'll see you thereHe flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in lineHe made a virus that would kill off all the swineHis perfect kingdom of killing, suffering and painDemands devotion, atrocities done in his nameYour god is dead and no one caresIf there is a Hell I'll see you thereYour god is dead and no one caresIf there is a Hell I'll see you thereBurning with your god in humilityWill you die for this?
