He sewed his eyes shut because he is afraid to see He tries to tell me what I put inside of me He's got the answers to ease my curiosity He dreamed a god up and called it Christianity Your god is dead and no one cares If there is a Hell I'll see you there He flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in line He made a virus that would kill off all the swine His perfect kingdom of killing, suffering and pain Demands devotion, atrocities done in his name Your god is dead and no one cares If there is a Hell I'll see you there Your god is dead and no one cares If there is a Hell I'll see you there Burning with your god in humility Will you die for this?
