Lost John's sittin' on a railroad trackSomething's out of whackBlues this mornin' fallin' down like hailGonna leave a greasy trailGonna travel the world is what I'm gonna doThen come back and see youAll I ever do is struggle and striveIf I don't do anybody any harm, I might make it back home aliveI'm the oldest son of a crazy manI'm in a cowboy bandGot a pile of sins to pay for and I ain't got time to hideI'd walk through a blazing fire, baby, if I knew you was on the other sideOh, I miss you, Nettie MooreAnd my happiness is overWinter's gone, the river's on the riseI loved you then and ever shallBut there's no one left here to tellThe world has gone black before my eyesWell, the world of research has gone berserkToo much paperworkAlbert's in the graveyard, Frankie's raising hellI'm beginning to believe what the scriptures tellI've gone where the Southern crosses The Yellow DogGet away from all these demagoguesAnd these bad luck women stick like glueIt's either one or the other or neither of the twoShe says,They say whisky'll kill you, but I don't think it willI'm ridin' with you to the top of the hillOh, I miss you, Nettie MooreAnd my happiness is overWinter's gone, the river's on the riseI loved you then and ever shallBut there's no one left here to tellThe world has gone black before my eyesDon't know why my baby never looked so good beforeDon't have to wonder no moreShe been cooking all day, it gonna take me all nightI can't eat all that stuff in a single biteThe judge is coming in, everybody riseLift up your eyesYou can do what you please, you don't need my advice'Fore you call me any dirty names, you better think twiceGettin' light outside, the temperature droppedI think the rain has stoppedI'm gonna make you come to grips with fateWhen I'm through with you, you'll learn to keep your business straightOh, I miss you, Nettie MooreAnd my happiness is overWinter's gone, the river's on the riseI loved you then and ever shallBut there's no one left here to tellThe world has gone black before my eyesThe bright spark of the steady lightsHas dimmed my sightsWhen you're around me all my grief gives wayA lifetime with you is like some heavenly dayEverything I've ever known to be right has been proven wrongI'll be drifting alongThe woman I'm a-loving, she rules my heartNo knife could ever cut our love apartToday I'll stand in faith and raiseThe voice of praiseThe sun is strong, I'm standing in the lightI wish to God that it were nightOh, I miss you, Nettie MooreAnd my happiness is overWinter's gone, the river's on the riseI loved you then and ever shallBut there's no one here left to tellThe world has gone black before my eyes
