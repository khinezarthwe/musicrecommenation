"No more runnin'," says my mindAll this movement has just proved, your kisses are too fineAll the harmony that I'd seenFriends I once had turn their thoughts away from meNo more runnin', I've got to breatheOn back porches with the torch of a firefly-lit treeIt's what I'd hoped forIt's what I'd hoped forNo more runnin'No more runnin'Well, lock my bones and trip my feetTell them, find a place to beStick like candy in your teethWill you lose your faith in me?"No more runnin'," says my mindAll this movement has just proved, your kisses hard to findIt's what I'd hoped forIt's what I'd hoped forNo more runnin'No more runnin'No more runnin'No more runnin'
