I've been a bad, bad girlI've been careless with a delicate manAnd it's a sad, sad worldWhen a girl will break a boyJust because she canDon't you tell me to deny itI've done wrong and I wanna suffer for my sinsI've come to you cause I need guidance to be trueAnd I just don't know where I can beginWhat I need is a good defenseCause I'm feelin' like a criminalAnd I need to be redeemedTo the one I've sinned againstBecause he's all I ever knew of loveHeaven help me for the way I amSave me from these evil deeds before I get them doneI know tomorrow brings the consequence at handBut I keep livin' this dayLike the next will never comeOh help me, but don't tell me to deny itI've got to cleanse myselfOf all these lies til I'm good enough for himI've got a lot to loseAnd I'm bettin' high so I'm beggin' youBefore it endsJust tell me where to beginWhat I need is a good defenseCause I'm feelin' like a criminalAnd I need to be redeemedTo the one I've sinned againstBecause he's all I ever knew of loveLet me know the wayBefore there's hell to payGive me room to lay the law and let me goI've got to make a playTo make my lover staySo what would an angel sayThe devil wants to knowWhat I need is a good defenseCause I'm feelin' like a criminalAnd I need to be redeemedTo the one I've sinned againstBecause he's all I ever knew of love
