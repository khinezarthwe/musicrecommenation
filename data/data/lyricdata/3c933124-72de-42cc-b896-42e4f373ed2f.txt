Revolution rock, it is a brand new rock A bad, bad rock, this here revolution rock Careful how you move, Mac, you dig me in me back And I'm so pilled up that I rattle I have got the sharpest knife So I cut the biggest slice I have no time to do battle Everybody smash up your seats And rock to this brand new beat This here music mash up the nation This here music cause a sensation Tell your ma, tell your pa Everything's gonna be all right Can't you feel it? Don't ignore it Gonna be alright Revolution rock, I am in a state of shock So bad, bad rock, this here revolution rock Careful how you slide, Clyde, all you did was glide And you poured your beer in me hat With my good eye on the beat, living on sensation street I ain't got no time for that To the cruellist mobsters in Kingstown, with the hardest eyes and the coldest tongue: Is your heart so made of rock that the blood must flow 'round the block? Are you listening mobsters? Hey! All people grow old, gotta die, while those kinda fools go rolling by It's food for thought, mobsters Young people shoot their days away I've seen talent thrown away All you loan sharks! The organ plays and they're dancing to the brand new beat This here music mash up the nation This here music cause a sensation Tell your ma-ma-ma-ma, tell your pa-pa-pa-pa everything's gonna be all right Can't you feel it? Don't ignore it Everything's gonna be alright I say, revolution rock There's that old cheese grater Rubbing me down This must be the way out Here's the cheap bit O O la oo la oo la Any song you want Playing requests now on the bandstand El Clash Combo Paid fifteen dollars a day Weddings, parties, anything And Bongo Jazz a speciality
