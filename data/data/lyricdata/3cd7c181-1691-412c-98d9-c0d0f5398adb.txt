How I wish I could surrender my soulShed the clothes that become my skinSee the liar that burns within my needingHow I wish I'd chosen darkness from coldHow I wish I had screamed out loudInstead I've found no meaningI guess it's time I run far, far away, find comfort in painAll pleasures the same, it just keeps me from troubleHides my true shape, like Dorian GrayI've heard what they say, but I'm not here for troubleIt's more than just words, it's just tears and rainHow I wish I could walk through the doors of my mindHold memory close at handHelp me understand the yearsHow I wish I could choose between Heaven and HellHow I wish I would save my soulI'm so cold from fearI guess it's time I run far, far away, find comfort in painAll pleasures the same, it just keeps me from troubleHides my true shape, like Dorian GrayI've heard what they say, but I'm not here for troubleFar, far away, find comfort in painAll pleasures the same, it just keeps me from troubleIt's more than just words, it's just tears and rainTears and rainTears and rainFar, far away, find comfort in painAll pleasures the same, it just keeps me from troubleIt's more than just words, it's just tears and rain
