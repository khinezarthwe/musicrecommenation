EverythingIs catching up with meI awakeTo find I'm not at all where IShould beAnd it feelsI'm getting to the endAnd it's hardTo figure out what's realAnd what'sPretendTo break from whatWe're tied toGod knowsHow much I've tried toAnd I am still inside youAnd I am still inside youI escapeEvery now and thenAnd to thinkI find myselfBack here againAnd againI used to know who I wasUntil you came alongI returnTo the only placeI've ever feltThat I belongTo break from whatWe're tied toGod knowsHow much I've tried toAnd I am still inside youAnd I am still inside you
