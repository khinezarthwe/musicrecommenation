Chorus. From here to Salvador the ladies dance To fill us reckless sons with the passions of the heart I've been around this town for so long She's been dancing since the first day I've been all around but I love coming back to see Lucy She swings me over to pull me out twirls around And I fall about in giggles and laughter Oh I'm plastered and can't deal help it I'm sorry love Bridge. What's to falling feeling feet but you know Who dancing around these streets there Lonely like you and your falling to ask For a dance or two With a heart of gold and a face so pale With a second hand dress and the lips of a tempress With a barstool banshee who howled at me The kings and queens of the clubs evolved from pubs And too much broken heart love And singing up the blues in a locked box bedroom A whap bopalu bop to whap bam boo Are you gonna take the chance Why do you care no one play fare And neither do the lords of the dance Chorus. Well a bang bang Anglo Saxons at the disco atishoo you all fall down Hound dogs rowl on the prowl for the next young girl Who told her daddy I'm going round Gemma's to learn and study Cos I'm young so free and I'm kinda sexy and when I'm on the floor All the boys that feel me and old dear diaries never been a friend of mine Chorus.
