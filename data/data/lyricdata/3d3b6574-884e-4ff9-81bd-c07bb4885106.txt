Chorus.From here to Salvador the ladies danceTo fill us reckless sons with the passions of the heartI've been around this town for so longShe's been dancing since the first dayI've been all around but I love coming back to see LucyShe swings me over to pull me out twirls aroundAnd I fall about in giggles and laughterOh I'm plastered and can't deal help itI'm sorry loveBridge.What's to falling feeling feet but you knowWho dancing around these streets thereLonely like you and your falling to askFor a dance or twoWith a heart of gold and a face so paleWith a second hand dress and the lips of a tempressWith a barstool banshee who howled at meThe kings and queens of the clubs evolved from pubsAnd too much broken heart loveAnd singing up the blues in a locked box bedroomA whap bopalu bop to whap bam booAre you gonna take the chanceWhy do you care no one play fareAnd neither do the lords of the danceChorus.Well a bang bang Anglo Saxons at the disco atishoo you all fall downHound dogs rowl on the prowl for the next young girlWho told her daddy I'm going round Gemma's to learn and studyCos I'm young so free and I'm kinda sexy and when I'm on the floorAll the boys that feel me and old dear diaries never been a friend of mineChorus.
