Oh oh oh oh, little China girlOh oh oh oh, little China girlI could escape this feeling with my China girlI feel a wreck without my little China girlI hear her heart beating loud as thunderSaw these stars crashingI'm a mess without my little China girlWake up in the morning, where's my little China girl?I hear her heart's beating loud as thunderSaw these stars crashing downI feel tragic like I'm Marlon BrandoWhen I look at my China girlI could pretend that nothing really meant too muchWhen I look at my China girlI stumble into town just like a sacred cowVisions of swastikas in my headPlans for everyoneIt's in the white of my eyesMy little China girlYou shouldn't mess with meI'll ruin everything you areYou knowI'll give you televisionI'll give you eyes of blueI'll give you a man who wants to rule the worldAnd when I get excitedMy little China girl saysShe says,She says,She saysShe saysOh oh oh oh, little China girlOh oh oh oh, little China girl
