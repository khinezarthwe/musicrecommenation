Cath, she standsWith a well-intentioned manBut she can't relaxWith his hand on the small of her backAnd as the flashbulbs burstShe holds a smileLike someone would holdA crying childAnd soon everybody will askWhat became of you'Cause your heart was dying fastAnd you didn't know what to doCath, it seemsThat you lived in someone else's dreamIn a hand-me-down wedding dressWith the things that could've been all repressedBut you said your vowsAnd you closed the doorOn so many menWho would have loved you moreAnd soon everybody will askWhat became of you'Cause your heart was dying fastAnd you didn't know what to doThe whispers that it won't lastRoll up and down the pewsBut if their hearts were dying that fastThey'd have done the same as youAnd I'd have done the same as you
