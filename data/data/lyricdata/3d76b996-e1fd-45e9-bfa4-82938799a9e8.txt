Since we're feeling so anaesthetised In our comfort zone Reminds me of the second time That I followed you home We're running out of alibis On the second of May Reminds me of the summertime On this winter's day See you at the bitter end See you at the bitter end Every step we take that's synchronised Every broken bone Reminds me of the second time That I followed you home You shower me with lullabies As you're walking away Reminds me that it's killing time On this fateful day See you at the bitter end See you at the bitter end See you at the bitter end See you at the bitter end From the time we intercepted Feels a lot like suicide Slow and sad, come in silence Arise a bitter mine See you at the bitter end I love to see you run around And I can see you now Running to me Arms wide out See you at the bitter end Come on reach inside Grab the gentleness inside Heard a cry Six months time In six months time Prepare the end See you at the bitter end
