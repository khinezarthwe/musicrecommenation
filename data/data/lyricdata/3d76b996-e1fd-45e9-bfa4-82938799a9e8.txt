Since we're feeling so anaesthetisedIn our comfort zoneReminds me of the second timeThat I followed you homeWe're running out of alibisOn the second of MayReminds me of the summertimeOn this winter's daySee you at the bitter endSee you at the bitter endEvery step we take that's synchronisedEvery broken boneReminds me of the second timeThat I followed you homeYou shower me with lullabiesAs you're walking awayReminds me that it's killing timeOn this fateful daySee you at the bitter endSee you at the bitter endSee you at the bitter endSee you at the bitter endFrom the time we interceptedFeels a lot like suicideSlow and sad, come in silenceArise a bitter mineSee you at the bitter endI love to see you run aroundAnd I can see you nowRunning to meArms wide outSee you at the bitter endCome on reach insideGrab the gentleness insideHeard a crySix months timeIn six months timePrepare the endSee you at the bitter end
