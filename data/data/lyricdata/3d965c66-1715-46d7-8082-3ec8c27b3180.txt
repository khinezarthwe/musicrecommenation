Twilight City gonna set my soul It's gonna set my soul on fire Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn So get those stakes up higher There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there They're all waiting, the devil may care And I'm just the devil with a lung to spare So viva Las Vegas Viva Las Vegas Viva Las Vegas How I wish that there were more Than the 24 hours in the day Even if I ran out of speed, boy I wouldn't sleep a minute of the way Oh, that blackjack and poker and the roulette wheel I'll poach your money lost on every deal All you need is sonar and nerves of steel So viva Las Vegas Viva Las Vegas Viva Las Vegas Viva Las Vegas where the neon signs flash your name The one-arm bandits cash in, all soap's down the drain Viva Las Vegas, turning day into nighttime, turning night into daytime If you see it once you'll never be the same again Gotta keep on running, gonna have me some money If it costs me my very last dime If I wind up broke then I'll always remember that I had a swinging time Oh, I'm gonna give it everything I've got Lady Luck's with me, the dice stay hot Got coke up my nose to dry away the snot So viva Las Vegas Viva Las Vegas Viva Las Vegas Viva, viva Las Vegas
