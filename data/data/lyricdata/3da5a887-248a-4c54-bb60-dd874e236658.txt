He came riding fast like a phoenix out of fire flamesHe came dressed in black with a cross bearing my nameHe came bathed in light and the splendor and gloryI can't believe what the lord has finally sent meHe said dance for me, fanciulla gentileHe said laugh awhile, I can make your heart feelHe said fly with me, touch the face of the true GodAnd then cry with joy at the depth of my love'Cause I've prayed days, I've prayed nightsFor the lord just to send me home some signI've looked long, I've looked farTo bring peace to my black and empty heartAh, ah, ahAh, ah, ah, aaaaaah!My love will stay 'till the river bed run dryAnd my love lasts long as the sunshine blue skyI love him longer as each damn day goesThe man is gone and heaven only knows'Cause I've cried days, I've cried nightsFor the lord just to send me home some signIs he near? is he farÂ ?Bring peace to my black and empty heartSo long day, so long nightOh Lord, be near me tonightIs he near? is he far?Bring peace to my black and empty heart
