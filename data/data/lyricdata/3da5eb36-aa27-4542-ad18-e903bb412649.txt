Settle down now and sit with meLet me tell you how this all came to beA yellow flower with your petals to the airAnd flying on paper wings that brought you hereSummer rolls on in the lazy hoursAn ether dream way of hummingbirds and cloudsMidnight swims in the cool black wavesAnd you in my arms as it rolls awayLittle dandelionLet your heart keep timeNow the clouds are goneAll your tomorrows shineAll your tomorrows shineAll your tomorrows shineBorn of restless nights, the moon as a pearlPlaying games down inside your soft warm worldHear my voice, I know that you canYou're the fire in my eyes, the sun as a manSeasons come along and seasons goAnd what they'll leave behindI don't pretend to knowI'm afraid that all I have missedWill loom very large when the darkness liftsLittle dandelionLet your heart keep timeNow the clouds are goneAll your tomorrows shineAll your tomorrows shineAll your tomorrowsI will ride by your sideWherever you goI won't run, I won't hideJust letting you knowJust letting you knowLittle dandelionLet your heart keep timeNow the clouds are goneAll your tomorrows shineAll your tomorrows shineAll your tomorrows shineAll your tomorrows shineAll your tomorrows shine
