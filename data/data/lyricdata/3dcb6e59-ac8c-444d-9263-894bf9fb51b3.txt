I got a question markYou got a need to always take some shot in the darkI don't have to make pretend, the picture I'm inIs totally clearYou think that all things have a way they ought to appear'Cause you know, you know, you know, you knowYou know, you know, you know, you knowYou know, I don't, I dreamDon't know what you meanPanic called you out and took you inGiving you an easy game and letting you winYou're giving back a little hatred now to the world'Cause it treated you bad'Cause you couldn't keep the great unknown from making you mad'Cause you know, you know, you know, you knowYou know, you know, you know, you knowYou know, I don't, I dreamDon't know what you meanSaid your final word, but honesty and love could've kept us togetherOne day you'll see it's worth it after allIf you ever want to say you're sorry you can give me a call, oohAhhAhh
