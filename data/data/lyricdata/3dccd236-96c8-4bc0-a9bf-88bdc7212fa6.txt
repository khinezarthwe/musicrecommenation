I was born a child of graceNothing else about the placeEverything was ugly but your beautiful faceAnd it left me no illusionI saw you in the curve of the moonIn the shadow cast across my roomYou heard me in my tuneWhen I just heard confusionAll because of youAll because of youAll because of youI am... I amI like the sound of my own voiceI didn't give anyone else a choiceAn intellectual tortoiseRacing with your bullet trainSome people get squashed crossing the tracksSome people got high rises on their backsI'm not broke but you can see the cracksYou can make me perfect againAll because of youAll because of youAll because of youI am... I amI'm aliveI'm being bornI just arrived, I'm at the doorOf the place I started out fromAnd I want back insideAll because of youAll because of youAll because of youI am
