Man! Clean town if you want to get away You pack your cases and you hope for a better day Mama's alright she said she didn't want you love Clean town if you want to get away, you pack your cases And you hope for a better day Joni's alright she said she didn't want your love Won't you walk down the main street Take the bridge over never ending rails And even if you're falling down That's an open door to the outside world So you live in a bubble So you've wasting your life On a system you never will understand Are you the one I dreamed of. Man! Clean town if you want to get away' You can drive to the east cost Disappear for a while Put the band-echo on, then we'll give him a ride Are you the one I dreamed of. Man! Clean town if you want to get away' Won't you get away'
