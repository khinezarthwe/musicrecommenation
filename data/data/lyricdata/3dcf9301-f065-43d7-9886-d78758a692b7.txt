You wanna worship its feelingsThe ones who's squeezing the shame from every manAnd if mama says it's dinner time, if she ruins your love, run awaySo you live in a prisonSo you're wasting your lifeOn a system you never will understandAre you the one I dreamed of. Man!Clean town if you want to get awayYou pack your cases and you hope for a better dayMama's alright she said she didn't want you loveClean town if you want to get away, you pack your casesAnd you hope for a better dayJoni's alright she said she didn't want your loveWon't you walk down the main streetTake the bridge over never ending railsAnd even if you're falling downThat's an open door to the outside worldSo you live in a bubbleSo you've wasting your lifeOn a system you never will understandAre you the one I dreamed of. Man!Clean town if you want to get away' You can drive to the east costDisappear for a whilePut the band-echo on, then we'll give him a rideAre you the one I dreamed of. Man!Clean town if you want to get away'Won't you get away'
