I don't want to spend the rest of my lifeLooking at the barrel of an ArmaliteI don't want to spend the rest of my daysKeeping out of trouble like the soldiers sayI don't want to spend my time in hellLooking at the walls of a prison cellI don't ever want to play the partOf a statistic on a government chartThere has to be an invisible sunIt gives its heat to everyoneThere has to be an invisible sunThat gives us hope when the whole day's doneIt's dark all day and it glows all nightFactory smoke and acetylene lightI face the day with me head caved inLooking like something that the cat brought inThere has to be an invisible sunIt gives its heat to everyoneThere has to be an invisible sunThat gives us hope when the whole day's doneAnd they're only going to change this placeBy killing everybody in the human raceThey would kill me for a cigaretteBut I don't even wanna die just yetThere has to be an invisible sunIt gives its heat to everyoneThere has to be an invisible sunIt gives us hope when the whole day's done
