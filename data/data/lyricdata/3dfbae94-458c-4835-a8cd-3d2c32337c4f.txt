Bored holes through our tonguesSo sing a song about itHeld our breath for too long‘Til we're half sick about itTell us what we did wrongAnd you can blame us for itTurn a clamp on our thumbsWe'll sew a doll about itAnd tell us all about itHow ‘bout some credit nowWhere credit is dueFor the damage that we've done?Wrought upon ourselves and othersWith a slow and vicious gunAnd although pratfalls can be funEncores can be fatalAnd then I hear you say"Thank God it's fatalNot shyNot shy of fatalThank God."Wait just a second nowIt's not all that badAre we not having fun?You're making mountains of handkerchiefsWhere the mascara always runsSo be careful when you're doneYou're bound to get post-natalWhat, did I just hear you say?"Thank God it's fatal."We don't want to hear the sound of a doorAnd we don't want to read the signs that you boreYou know, the kind of sign you hang on the doorSaying, "we'll be back"- what a crackNow don't you think we might have heard that before?Bored holes through our tonguesSo sing a song about itHeld our breath for too long‘Til we're half sick about itTell us what we did wrongAnd you can blame us for itTurn a clamp on our thumbsWe'll sew a doll about it
