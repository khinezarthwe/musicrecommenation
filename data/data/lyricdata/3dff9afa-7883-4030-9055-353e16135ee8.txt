I'm being dragged down, down by the handThe hand of a golden, giant manHe's crushing my knuckles and splitting my skinHe says he will let go if only I'd ask it of himHe says, "Girl, it's your callYou wanna fly? You wanna fall?"So I shout, "I wanna get away from you as fast as I canI'd tell my feet to move it, I hope they have a plan"These little black sandals are walking me awayThese little black sandals are heading the right wayThese little black sandals are walking me awayThese little black sandals saved my life todaySo now I'm free, freeFrom the big, bad giant who was stalking meThank you feet for guiding me, yeahI'm glad somehow I got brains down there, at leastThese little black sandals are walking me awayThese little black sandals are heading the right wayThese little black sandals are walking me awayThese little black sandals saved my life todaySometimes I'm tempted, sometimes I amI would be lying if I said I didn't miss that giant manOh, he was the line between pleasure and painBut me and the feet have some years to reclaimThese little black sandals are walking me awayThese little black sandals are heading the right wayThese little black sandals are walking me awayThese little black sandals saved my life todayOhThese little black sandals are walking me awayOhThese little black sandals are heading the right wayOh, yeahThese little black sandals are walking me awayOhThese little black sandals saved my life todayThese little black sandals are walking me awayThese little black sandals are heading the right wayThese little black sandals are walking me awayThese little black sandals saved my life today
