Every breath you takeAnd every move you makeEvery bond you break, every step you takeI'll be watching youEvery single dayAnd every word you sayEvery game you play, every night you stayI'll be watching youOh, can't you seeYou belong to me?How my poor heart achesWith every step you takeEvery move you makeEvery vow you breakEvery smile you fake, every claim you stakeI'll be watching youSince you've gone, I've been lost without a traceI dream at night, I can only see your faceI look around, but it's you I can't replaceI feel so cold and I long for your embraceI keep crying baby, baby, pleaseOh, can't you seeYou belong to me?How my poor heart achesWith every step you takeEvery move you makeAnd every vow you breakEvery smile you fake, every claim you stakeI'll be watching youEvery move you make, every step you takeI'll be watching youI'll be watching youI'll be watching youI'll be watching youI'll be watching youI'll be watching youI'll be watching youI'll be watching youI'll be watching youI'll be watching you
