Gazing through the window at the world outsideWondering will Mother Earth surviveHoping that mankind will stop abusing herSometimeAfter all there's only just the two of usAnd here we are still fighting for our livesWatching all of history repeat itselfI'm just a dreamerI dream my life awayI'm just a dreamerWho dreams of better daysI watch the sun go down like everyone of usI'm hoping that the dawn will bring a signA better place for those who will come after usThis timeI'm just a dreamerI dream my life away, oh yeahI'm just a dreamerWho dreams of better daysYour higher power may be God or Jesus ChristIt doesn't really matter much to meWithout each others help there ain't no hope for usI'm living in a dream, a fantasy, oh yeah yeah yeahIf only we could all just find serenityIt would be nice if we could live as oneWhen will all this anger, hate and bigotryBe gone?I'm just a dreamerI dream my life away todayI'm just a dreamerWho dreams of better days, oh yeahI'm just a dreamerWho's searching for the way, todayI'm just a dreamerDreaming my life awayOh, yeah yeah yeah
