You cannot quit me so quicklyThere's no hope in you for meNo corner you could squeeze meBut I got all the time for you loveThe space betweenThe tears we cry...Is the laughter that keeps us coming back for moreThe space between...The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the painBut will I hold you againThese fickle fuddled words confuse meLike will it rain todayWe waste the hours with talking, talkingThese twisted games we're playingWe're strange alliesWith warring heartsWhat a wild eyed beast you beThe space betweenThe wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the painBut will I hold you againWill I holdLook at us spinning out in the madness of a roller coasterYou know you went off like the devil in the churchIn the middle of a crowded roomAll we can do my loveIs hope we don't take this ship downThe space betweenWhere you smile and hideIs where you'll find me if I get to goThe space betweenThe bullets in our fire fightIs where I'll be hiding waiting for youThe rain that fallsSplashed in your heartRan like sadness down the window into your roomThe space betweenOur wicked lies isWhere we hope to keep safe from painTake my handCause we're walking out of hereRight out of hereLove is all we need dearThe space betweenWhat's wrong and rightIs where you'll find me hidingWaiting for youThe space betweenIn your heart and mineIs the space we'll fill with timeThe space between
