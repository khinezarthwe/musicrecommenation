You cannot quit me so quickly There's no hope in you for me No corner you could squeeze me But I got all the time for you love The space between The tears we cry... Is the laughter that keeps us coming back for more The space between... The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain But will I hold you again These fickle fuddled words confuse me Like will it rain today We waste the hours with talking, talking These twisted games we're playing We're strange allies With warring hearts What a wild eyed beast you be The space between The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain But will I hold you again Will I hold Look at us spinning out in the madness of a roller coaster You know you went off like the devil in the church In the middle of a crowded room All we can do my love Is hope we don't take this ship down The space between Where you smile and hide Is where you'll find me if I get to go The space between The bullets in our fire fight Is where I'll be hiding waiting for you The rain that falls Splashed in your heart Ran like sadness down the window into your room The space between Our wicked lies is Where we hope to keep safe from pain Take my hand Cause we're walking out of here Right out of here Love is all we need dear The space between What's wrong and right Is where you'll find me hiding Waiting for you The space between In your heart and mine Is the space we'll fill with time The space between
