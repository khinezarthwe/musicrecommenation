My head is a-spinning roundMy heart is in my shoes, yeahI went and set the Thames on fireNow I must come back downShe's laughing in her sleeve, boysI can feel it in my bonesOh, but anywhere, anywhere I'm gonna lay my headI'm gonna call my homeWell I see that the world is upside-downSeems that my pockets were filled up with goldAnd now the clouds, well they've covered everything, ohAnd the wind is blowing coldWell I don't need anybodybecause I learned, I learned to be aloneWell I said anywhere, anywhere, anywhere I lay my head, boysWell I gonna call my home
