My true love went riding out in white and green and grayPast the pale of Offa's wall where she was wont to strayAnd there she came upon a white and wounded fawnSinging,She, being full of charity, a credit to her sex,Sought to right the fawn's hind legs when here her plans were vexedThe taiga shifted strange the beast began to changeSinging,Singing,You'll learn soon enough the prettiest whistles won't wrestle the thistles undone, undoneFifteen lithesome maidens lay alone in their bowerFourteen occupations paid to pass the idle hourBut Margaret heaves a sigh her hands clasped to her thighSinging,Singing,You'll learn soon enough the prettiest whistles won't wrestle the thistles  undone, undoneUndone, undone, undone
