You almost always pick the best timesTo drop the worst linesYou almost made me cry again this timeAnother false alarmRed flashing lightsWell this time I'm not going to watch myself dieI think I made it a game to play your gameAnd let myself cryI buried myself alive on the insideSo I could shut you outAnd let you go away for a long time(Chorus)I guess it's okay I puked the day awayI guess it's better you trapped yourself in your own wayAnd if you want me backYou're gonna have to askI think the chain broke awayAnd I felt it the day that I had my own time.I took advantage of myself and felt fineBut it was worth the nightI caught an early flight and I made it home(Repeat Chorus)Nicer than that (2x)With my foot on your neckI finally have youRight where I want you (4x)(repeat chorus)Nicer than thatI guess it's okay I puked the day away. (Nicer than that)I guess it's better you trapped yourself in your own way.(Nicer then that)And if you want me back,You're gonna have to askNicer than thatNicer!Nicer!
