Breathe a little bit Breathe a little bit for me now Dance a little bit Dance a little bit for me now And when the storm come's late And turns out the lights There is no need to worry Everything is alright You've got your dog and your blanket And your candles for light Yeah, everythings gonna be alright Give a little bit Give a little piece of your heart Dance around now baby Dance around and play the part Make your grandma happy Roll it around... And when the storm come's late And turns out the lights There is no need to worry Everything is alright You've got your dog and your blanket And your candles for light Yeah, everythings gonna be alright
