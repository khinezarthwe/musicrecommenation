Last nightI dreamed that I was dreaming of youAnd from a window across the lawn I watched you undressWearing a sunset of purple tightly woven around your hairThat rose and strangled ebony curls moving in a yellow bedroom lightThe air is wet with soundThe faraway yelping of a wounded dogAnd the ground is drinking a slow faucet leakYour house is so soft and fading as it soaks the black summer heatA light goes on and a door opensAnd a yellow cat runs out on the stream of hall light and into the yardA wooden cherry scent is faintly breathing the airI hear your champagne laughYou wear two lavender orchids one in your hair and one on your hipA string of yellow carnival lights comes on with the duskCircling the lake with a slowly dipping haloAnd I hear a Banjo tangoAnd you dance into the shadow of a Black Poplar TreeAnd I watched you as you disappearedI watched you as you disappearedI watched you as you disappearedI watched you as you disappearedI watched you as you disappeared...
