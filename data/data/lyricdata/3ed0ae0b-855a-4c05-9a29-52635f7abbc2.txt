The perfect words never crossed my mind'cause there was nothing in there but you I felt every ounce of me screaming out But the sound was trapped deep in me All I wanted just sped right past me While I was rooted fast to the earth I could be stuck here for a thousand years Without your arms to drag me out There you are standing right in front of me There you are standing right in front of me All this fear falls away to leave me naked Hold me close cause I need you to guide me to safety No I don't wanna wait forever No I don't wanna wait forever In the confusion and the aftermath You are my signal fire The only resolution and the only joy Is the faint spark of forgiveness in your eyes There you are standing right in front of me There you are standing right in front of me All this fear falls away to leave me naked Hold me close cause I need you to guide me to safety There you are standing right in front of me There you are standing right in front of me All this fear falls away to leave me naked Hold me close cause I need you to guide me to safety No I don't wanna wait forever No I don't wanna wait forever No I don't wanna wait forever
