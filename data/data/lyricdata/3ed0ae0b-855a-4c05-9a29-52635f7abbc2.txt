The perfect words never crossed my mind'cause there was nothing in there but youI felt every ounce of me screaming outBut the sound was trapped deep in meAll I wanted just sped right past meWhile I was rooted fast to the earthI could be stuck here for a thousand yearsWithout your arms to drag me outThere you are standing right in front of meThere you are standing right in front of meAll this fear falls away to leave me nakedHold me close cause I need you to guide me to safetyNo I don't wanna wait foreverNo I don't wanna wait foreverIn the confusion and the aftermathYou are my signal fireThe only resolution and the only joyIs the faint spark of forgiveness in your eyesThere you are standing right in front of meThere you are standing right in front of meAll this fear falls away to leave me nakedHold me close cause I need you to guide me to safetyThere you are standing right in front of meThere you are standing right in front of meAll this fear falls away to leave me nakedHold me close cause I need you to guide me to safetyNo I don't wanna wait foreverNo I don't wanna wait foreverNo I don't wanna wait forever
