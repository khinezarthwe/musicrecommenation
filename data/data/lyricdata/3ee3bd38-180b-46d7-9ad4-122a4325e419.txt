I'm here, you're thereCome closer, tonight I'm lonelyCome here with meI want it the way it used to beWhat is left of love?Tell me, who would even care?So much time has passedI'd still meet you anywhereWater under bridgeEvening after dayWhat is left of loveHere that didn't drift away?I can remember days of sunWe knew our lives had just begunWe could do anything, we're fearless when we're youngUnder the moon, address unknownI can remember nights in RomeI thought that love would last, a promise set in stoneI'd survive with only memoriesIf I could change the way I feelBut I want more than only memoriesA human touch to make them realAnother day, another dreamOver the bridge an empty sceneWe'd spend the weekend lost in bed and float upstreamI don't know why we moved awayLost in the here and now we strayedInto a New York zone, our promise was betrayedI was there, caught on Tenth AvenueYou elsewhere with Culver City bluesThen and there I knew that I'd lost youWhat is left of love?Tell me, who will even care?So much time has passedI'd still meet you anywhereWater under bridgeEvening after dayWhat is left of loveHere that didn't drift away?Don't give me all your love and painDon't sell me New York in the rainLet's leave our promises behindRewind and try againWhat remains in time that didn't fade away?Sometimes I need to seeThe way it used to be
