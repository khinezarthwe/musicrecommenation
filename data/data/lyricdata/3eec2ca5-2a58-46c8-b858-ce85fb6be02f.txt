You said I began This messy state of love affair And I drink too much and smoke too fast And this city's cleared my innocence Coffee is pouring out my ears It's the only thing they have in here And my heart stops beating And when it stops it stops My heart stopped beating And when it stops it stops My heart stopped beating Number tree still on my plate I heard the trains are running late And I laugh out loud My life is a mess I have gone too far In my lifelessness Another coffee it's on the house The poor girl look is on the owners spouse And my heart stopped beating And when it stops it stops My heart stopped beating And when it stops it stops My heart stopped beating Outside your house To make a scene In my head you grabbed me passionately But the lights are out And in an hour I walked on home In the pouring shower Lost my keys in front of me My neighbor's smile he's handing me The blackest coffee you will ever see And my hearts stopped beating And when it stops it stops My heart stopped beating And when it stops it stops My heart stopped beating
