You said I beganThis messy state of love affairAnd I drink too much and smoke too fastAnd this city's cleared my innocenceCoffee is pouring out my earsIt's the only thing they have in hereAnd my heart stops beatingAnd when it stops it stopsMy heart stopped beatingAnd when it stops it stopsMy heart stopped beatingNumber tree still on my plateI heard the trains are running lateAnd I laugh out loudMy life is a messI have gone too farIn my lifelessnessAnother coffee it's on the houseThe poor girl look is on the owners spouseAnd my heart stopped beatingAnd when it stops it stopsMy heart stopped beatingAnd when it stops it stopsMy heart stopped beatingOutside your houseTo make a sceneIn my head you grabbed me passionatelyBut the lights are outAnd in an hour I walked on homeIn the pouring showerLost my keys in front of meMy neighbor's smile he's handing meThe blackest coffee you will ever seeAnd my hearts stopped beatingAnd when it stops it stopsMy heart stopped beatingAnd when it stops it stopsMy heart stopped beating
