You're feelin' oldIt's 1 o'clock on a Friday morning,I'm trying to keep my back from the wall.The prophets and their pawns have had another successAnd I'm wondering why we bother at all.And I think of you on cold winter mornings, darlingThey remind me of when we were in school,Nothing really mattered when you called out my nameIn fact nothing really mattered at allAnd I think about how long it will take them to blow us awayBut I won't get me down!I'm just thankful to be facing the day.Cause days don't get you far when you're young.It's 5 o' clock on a Friday morningOne hundred telephones shake and ringOne of those was someone who knew youAnd I'll still think of you on cold winter mornings, darlingThey'll still remind me of when we were in schoolWhen they could never have persuaded me,That lives like yours, were in the hands of these erroneous foolsAnd to those of you who mourn your lives through one day to the nextWell let them take you next!Can't you live and be thankful you're here?See - it could be you, tomorrow, next year.
