Nothing I can do about itMaybe I won't even tryYour will is determined to kill anyReason of mineI see you comingWith that look in your eyeYou act like a king, but you ain't got a thingIn your mindAnd now there's nobody homeMy belly is achingYour image is blownYour lights are burning brightBut nobody's homeYou talk about love and affectionIf only you couldYou're full of pride, but there's nothing insideAnd you think you're so goodYou know you got it coming to yaAll things returnYou need meIt's not gonna be my concernAnd now there's nobody homeYour message is changingThe children have grownYour lights are burning brightBut nobody's homeI hear you cryingWhat can I say?You get what you give soForgive me as I turn awayNobody's homeA legend is dyingThe seeds have been sownYour lights are burning brightBut nobody's home.
