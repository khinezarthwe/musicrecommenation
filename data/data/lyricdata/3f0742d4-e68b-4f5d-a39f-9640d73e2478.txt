You better you better you bet, ooh You better you better you bet, ooh You better you better you bet, ooh You better you better you bet, ooh I call you on the telephone My voice too rough with cigarettes I sometimes feel I should just go home But I'm dealing with a memory that never forgets I love to hear you say my name Especially when you say yes I got your body right now on my mind But I drunk myself blind to the sound of old T- Rex Mmm To the sound of old T- Rex Oh, and " Who's Next" When I say I love you you say you better When I say I need you you say you better You better bet your life Or love will cut you, cut you like a knife I want those feeble-minded Axes overthrown I'm not into your passport picture I just like your nose You welcome me with open arms And open legs I know only fools have needs But this one never begs I don't really mind how much you love me Ooh, a little is all right When you say come over and spend the night Tonight, tonight When I say I love you you say you better When I say I need you you say you better You better bet your life Or love will cut you, cut you like a knife I lay on the bed with you We could make some book of records Your dog keeps licking my nose And chewing up all those letters Saying "you better" You better bet your life You better love me, all the time now You better shove me back into line now You better love me, all the time now You better shove me back into line now I showed up late one night With a neon light for a visa But knowing I'm so eager to fight Can't make letting me in any easier I know that I been wearing crazy clothes And I look pretty crappy sometimes But my body feels so good And I still sing a razor line every time And when it comes to all night living I know what I'm giving I've got it all down to a tee And it's free When I say I love you you say you better When I say I need you you say you better When I say I love you you say you better When I say I need you you scream you better Ooh, when I say I love you you say you better And when I say I need you you say you better When I say I love you you say you better And when I say I need you you scream you better You better bet your life Or love will cut you Just like a knife
