It's okay in the day, I'm staying busyTied up enough so I don't have to wonder,Got so sick of crying, so just latelyWhen I catch myself, I do a 180I stay up, clean the house, at least I'm not drinkingRun around just so I don't have to think about thinkingThat silent sense of content that everyone getsJust disappears soon as the sun setsHe is fierce in my dreams seizes my gutsHe floods me with dreadSoaked in soulHe swims in my eyes by the bedPour myself over himMoon spilling inAnd I wake up aloneAs far as my heart, I'd rather be restlessThe second I stop, the sleep catches up and I'm breathlessThis ache in my chest as my day is done nowThe dark covers me and I cannot run nowMy blood running cold, I stand before himIt's all I can do to assure himWhen he comes to me, I drip for him tonightDrowning in me we bathe under blue lightHe is fierce in my dreams seizes my gutsHe floods me with dreadSoaked in soulHe swims in my eyes by the bedPour myself over himMoon spilling inAnd I wake up aloneAnd I wake up aloneAnd I wake up aloneAnd I wake up alone
