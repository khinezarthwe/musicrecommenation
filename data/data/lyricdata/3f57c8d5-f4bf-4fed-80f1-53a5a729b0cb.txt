Took her in, dropped a line, turned me on, I travel, I travelWe never leave each other 'cause we leave each other so coldMakes it melt awayThe easy part is taking yourself in,It's wartime every time, shot awayYou wipe the smile from your face, it's getting in the wayIt's wartime every timeShe cut me a line and she turned me on, she made it coolYou couldn't do it if you wanted toIt's wartime every time, small talk every timeIt's my favorite chloroformIt's pill talk every time, get it out the wayFriction wound, shot awayRicochet, we're like identical twins, sucking on the same teatSpitting out the same things, I travel far, I travel farIt's wartime every time, small talk every timeIt's my favorite chloroformIt's pill talk every time, get it out the wayFriction wound, ricochetLine 'em up and knock 'em downShot away, shot away, shot away, shot away
