Took her in, dropped a line, turned me on, I travel, I travel We never leave each other 'cause we leave each other so cold Makes it melt away The easy part is taking yourself in, It's wartime every time, shot away You wipe the smile from your face, it's getting in the way It's wartime every time She cut me a line and she turned me on, she made it cool You couldn't do it if you wanted to It's wartime every time, small talk every time It's my favorite chloroform It's pill talk every time, get it out the way Friction wound, shot away Ricochet, we're like identical twins, sucking on the same teat Spitting out the same things, I travel far, I travel far It's wartime every time, small talk every time It's my favorite chloroform It's pill talk every time, get it out the way Friction wound, ricochet Line 'em up and knock 'em down Shot away, shot away, shot away, shot away
