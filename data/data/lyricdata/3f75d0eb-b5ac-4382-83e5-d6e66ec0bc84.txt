Broken watchesFeeling fractiousI know you don't love it soFalling overOff the tyreI-I know it seems too farThis garden is growing overThis hard ice I'm roaming onWatch outFat chance that you'll ever get anotherChance to be a cover upMy head and wipe a flannelFalling overAeroplanes andWanting to be a derelictWhat to cover?Love each otherI know, lie lie lieThis garden is growing overAnd nothing can ever be said for youAnd that's justHere's your answerWhy bother?I've never been nothing otherThan the boy with the wordsThat lose control
