Broken watches Feeling fractious I know you don't love it so Falling over Off the tyre I- I know it seems too far This garden is growing over This hard ice I'm roaming on Watch out Fat chance that you'll ever get another Chance to be a cover up My head and wipe a flannel Falling over Aeroplanes and Wanting to be a derelict What to cover? Love each other I know, lie lie lie This garden is growing over And nothing can ever be said for you And that's just Here's your answer Why bother? I've never been nothing other Than the boy with the words That lose control
