Would you please take me away from this place?I cannot bear to see the look upon your facesAnd if there is some kind of god, do you think he's pleased?When he looks down on us, I wonder what he seesDo you think he'd think the things we do are a waste of time?Maybe he'd think that we are getting on just fineDo you think he's skint or financially secure?And come election time, I wonder who he'd vote forEver since he can remember, people have died in his good nameLong before that September, long before hijacking planesHe's lost the will, he can't decideHe doesn't know who's right or wrongBut there's one thing that he's sure of:This has been going on too longDo you think he'd drive in his car without insurance?Now, is he interesting or do you think he'd bore us?Do you think his favourite type of human is Caucasian?Do you reckon he's ever been done for tax evasion?Do you think he's any good at remembering people's names?Do you think he's ever taken smack or cocaine?I don't imagine he's ever been suicidalHis favourite band isEver since he can remember, people have died in his good nameLong before that September, long before hijacking planesHe's lost the will, he can't decideHe doesn't know who's right or wrongBut there's one thing that he's sure of:This has been going on too longEver since he can remember, people have died in his good nameLong before that September, long before hijacking planesHe's lost the will, he can't decideHe doesn't know who's right or wrongBut there's one thing that he's sure of:This has been going on too long
