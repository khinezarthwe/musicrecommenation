I heard you on the wireless back in '52Lying awake intently tuning in on youIf I was young it didn't stop you coming throughThey took the credit for your second symphonyRewritten by machine on new technologyAnd now I understand the problems you can seeI met your childrenWhat did you tell them?Pictures came and broke your heartAnd now we meet in an abandoned studioWe hear the playback and it seems so long agoAnd you remember the jingles used to go:You were the first oneYou were the last oneIn my mind and in my carWe can't rewind, we've gone too farIn my mind and in my carWe can't rewind, we've gone too farPictures came and broke your heartPut the blame on VTR...You are the radio starYou are the radio starYou are the radio starYou are the radio star
