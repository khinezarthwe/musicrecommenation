I heard you on the wireless back in '52 Lying awake intently tuning in on you If I was young it didn't stop you coming through They took the credit for your second symphony Rewritten by machine on new technology And now I understand the problems you can see I met your children What did you tell them? Pictures came and broke your heart And now we meet in an abandoned studio We hear the playback and it seems so long ago And you remember the jingles used to go: You were the first one You were the last one In my mind and in my car We can't rewind, we've gone too far In my mind and in my car We can't rewind, we've gone too far Pictures came and broke your heart Put the blame on V T R... You are the radio star You are the radio star You are the radio star You are the radio star
