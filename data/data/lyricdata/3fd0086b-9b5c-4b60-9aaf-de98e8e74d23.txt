You changed your reason With the wave of your hand Fill me with wonder like a child' Cause you'll never understand It's a sin not to say when it's over It's a crime to deny when it's gone' Cause you're fooling yourself, and nobody else It's a sin if you carry it on If you want to make love, you whisper my name I say I never want to use you for your love But you tail me and you make it all the same It's a sin not to say when it's over It's a crime to deny when it's gone' Cause you're fooling yourself, and nobody else It's a sin if you carry it on' Cause I'm a man A peaceful loving man And I'm so tired to hold it inside When I feel, I'm going to hide Peace loving man Peace loving man Peace loving man It's a sin not to say when it's over It's a crime to deny when it's gone' Cause you're fooling yourself, and nobody else It's a sin if you carry it on' Cause I'm a man Oh, baby, I'm a man Peace loving man Baby, I'm just a man Peace loving man I can't use you any more Peace loving man
