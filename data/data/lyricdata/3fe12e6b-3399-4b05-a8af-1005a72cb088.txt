Cursed Earth, cursed Earth, cursed Earth, cursed Earth I'll never feed off the evergreen luster of your heart All because we all live in the valley of the walls When they speak, we can peek from the windows of their mouths To see the land, the women chant as they fly up to the sun You never think you know why, know You never think you know why, know Ever think you know why, know Books all say different things, while people flap their yellow wings Trying to soar by being a whore of life and almost everything The sheep that ran off from the herd may be dead But now's a bird able to fly, able to die, able to fuck your brother's earth You never think you know why, know You never think you know why, know Ever think you know why, know On the other side, on the other side, the other side, Do you ever try to fly, do you ever try to fly? Have you ever wanted to die, have you ever wanted to die? Don't ever try to fly, don't ever try to fly, Don't ever try to fly, unless you leave your body on the other side, Never try to die, you ever try to die. You never think you know why, know You never think you know why, know You never think you know why, know Ever think you know why, know
