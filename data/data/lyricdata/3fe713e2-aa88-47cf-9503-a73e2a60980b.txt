Feelings come and go - I've never knownSomething longs to grow - won't let goSpirits 'round my head - are whisperingI turn inside instead - of wonderingDeep inside of me - I know there's got to beA different kind of truth - that sets the spirit freeIf I don't wanna know - what's written inside meHow could I see anything - how could I be anything?Restless minds have searched - long beforeThe truth will be the same - for evermoreThe mightiness of trees - that you can feelCan give you all you need - just listen stillHere is love and there is painIt's all around, it's all the sameThere's nothing new that I could tell to youBut still there is the universe inside of us that never burstsWe might not know the meaning yet, but I'm sure we can't rejectThe truth that is in everything - that is and has been and will beThere is a long way to go - there is a high place to knowThere is a world to go through - but there's so much more to doUntil we're home!Deep inside of me - I know there's got to beA different kind of truth - that sets the spirit freeIf I don't wanna know - what's written inside meHow could I see anything - how could I be anything?Feelings come and go - I've never known
