You get what you seeI saw a rich fuck given charityI saw an evil emperorWearing my clothesFar from the bestThey might suit you better than the restJust looking in the mirrorWill make you a brave manI know my placeI hate my faceI know how I begin and how I'll endStrung out againWas a parliament of owlsFlying over a city of canalsFloating on the bodyFloating in the damsYou get what you seeSome things they just change invisiblyI don't know where I'm goingI don't even wanna knowI know my placeI hate my faceI know how I begin and how I'll endStrung out againStanding, smilingOn some fantasy islandLooking at my lost reflection againOh the tide's rolling inAnd I'm strung out againStrung out again
