You get what you see I saw a rich fuck given charity I saw an evil emperor Wearing my clothes Far from the best They might suit you better than the rest Just looking in the mirror Will make you a brave man I know my place I hate my face I know how I begin and how I'll end Strung out again Was a parliament of owls Flying over a city of canals Floating on the body Floating in the dams You get what you see Some things they just change invisibly I don't know where I'm going I don't even wanna know I know my place I hate my face I know how I begin and how I'll end Strung out again Standing, smiling On some fantasy island Looking at my lost reflection again Oh the tide's rolling in And I'm strung out again Strung out again
