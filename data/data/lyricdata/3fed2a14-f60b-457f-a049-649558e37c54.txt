NowThe mist across the window hides the linesBut nothing hides the colour of the lights that shineElectricity so fineLook and dry your eyesWeSo tired of all the darkness in our livesWith no more angry words to say can come aliveGet into a car and driveTo the other sideMe babe, steppin' outInto the nightInto the lightYou babe, steppin' outInto the nightInto the lightWeAre young but getting old before our timeWe'll leave the TV and the radio behindDon't you wonder what we'll findSteppin' out tonightYouCan dress in pink and blue just like a childAnd in a yellow taxi turn to me and smileWe'll be there in just a whileIf you follow meMe babe, steppin' outInto the nightInto the lightYou babe, steppin' outInto the nightInto the lightMe babe, steppin' outInto the nightInto the lightYou babe, steppin' outInto the nightInto the lightMe babe, steppin' outInto the nightInto the light
