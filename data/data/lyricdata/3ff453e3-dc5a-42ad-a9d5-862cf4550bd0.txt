Strain living with a name They get the best of me, but I'm no walker away I don't complain, I got much to gain So they keep testing me and I keep feeding their face But they could go, off and hit the road And what would I care, I like going nowhere I got the reins and courage I was made of And they've got fake love, so I know I must show It's my show I must go With my soul Not my hand Where I stand It's my role It's my soul Pearls and necklaces and girls And all the pretty things I ain't seeking to have It's safe to say, if I don't get this out of me I might quite easily end up dead or just mad Cross my t's, try to dot my i's But that's just blinding me, I ain't living that way I roll my sleeves and make a better man of me Or I might easily just give up On this show It's my show I must go With my soul Not my hand Where I stand It's my role It's my soul I must show It's my show I must go With my soul Not my hand Where I stand It's my role It's my soul And my show It's my show
