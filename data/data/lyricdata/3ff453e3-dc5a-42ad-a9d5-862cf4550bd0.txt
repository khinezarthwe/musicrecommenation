Strain living with a nameThey get the best of me, but I'm no walker awayI don't complain, I got much to gainSo they keep testing me and I keep feeding their faceBut they could go, off and hit the roadAnd what would I care, I like going nowhereI got the reins and courage I was made ofAnd they've got fake love, so I knowI must showIt's my showI must goWith my soulNot my handWhere I standIt's my roleIt's my soulPearls and necklaces and girlsAnd all the pretty things I ain't seeking to haveIt's safe to say, if I don't get this out of meI might quite easily end up dead or just madCross my t's, try to dot my i'sBut that's just blinding me, I ain't living that wayI roll my sleeves and make a better man of meOr I might easily just give upOn this showIt's my showI must goWith my soulNot my handWhere I standIt's my roleIt's my soulI must showIt's my showI must goWith my soulNot my handWhere I standIt's my roleIt's my soulAnd my showIt's my show
