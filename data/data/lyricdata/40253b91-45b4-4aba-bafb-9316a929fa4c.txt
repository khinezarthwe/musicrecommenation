Feel a chill in the dark,twilight falls.Feel the beat of your heart,danger calls.Up to the rooftop, out in the rain...Well I'm planning it out,day by day.There's no room for doubt,just one way.Up to the rooftop, out in the rain...And I'm looking out over West Berlin.Feeling freer now than I've ever been.When the sun sets over West Berlin,I'll be leaving, I can't come back again.And I'm looking out over West Berlin,West Berlin.In the flood of the light,safety will shine.We'll be high out of sight,on steel cable line.Up to the rooftop, out in the rain...And I'm looking out over West Berlin.Feeling freer now than I've ever been.When the sun sets over West Berlin,I'll be leaving, I can't come back again.And I'm looking out over West Berlin,West Berlin.
