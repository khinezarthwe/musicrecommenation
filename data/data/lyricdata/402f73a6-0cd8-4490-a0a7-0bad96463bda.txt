Half past twelveAnd I'm watching the late show in my flat all aloneHow I hate to spend the evening on my own!Autumn windsBlowing outside the window as I look around the roomAnd it makes me so depressed to see the gloomThere's not a soul out thereNo one to hear my prayerGimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!Take me through the darkness to the break of the dayMovie starsFind the end of the rainbow with a fortune to winIt's so different from the world I'm living inTired of TVI open the window and I gaze into the nightBut there's nothing there to see; no one in sightThere's not a soul out thereNo one to hear my prayerGimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!Take me through the darkness to the break of the dayGimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!There's not a soul out thereNo one to hear my prayerGimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!Take me through the darkness to the break of the dayGimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight!Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
