When I look back on everything I've doneI know you must have cried a river of tearsBut you were there when I was feeling lowTo walk me through my darkest fearsSo when the sun goes downAnd those nights grow colderI will be thereLooking over your shoulderAnd the deeper the loveThe stronger the emotionAnd the stronger the loveThe deeper the devotionThere were times I almost let you goWhen I thought I needed to break freeBut you were there to whisper in my ear,So when the sun goes downAnd those nights are growing colderI will be thereLooking over your shoulderAnd the deeper the loveThe stronger the emotionAn' the stronger the loveThe deeper the devotionI don't mind what you're doing to meI don't mind, 'cause you're all I can seeI don't mind, baby, you mean the world to meWhen the sun goes downAnd those nights are growing colderI will be thereLooking over your shoulder, baby, baby, babySo when the sun goes downAnd those nights are growing colderI will be thereLooking over your shoulder'Cause the deeper the loveThe stronger the emotionAnd the stronger the loveThe deeper the devotion'Cause the deeper the loveThe stronger the emotionAnd the stronger the loveThe deeper, the deeper, the deeper the devotionI'm never gonna let you goIn my heart, I knowI love you, I love youOh baby, I really love you, ooh
