Found something crying, it was my soulI fed it milk so it wouldn't grow oldWe crossed the borderline at dawnAnd woke up in a field of cornThe farmer told me I was lateI better start oiling the gateSaid that those who rush will fallBut I don't wanna wait for wavesI don't wanna wait at allOh, Annie, let's not waitLet's cross the river nowWe could sit for yearsStaring at our fearsOh, they're such pretty thingsThey're so cuteBut our dreams are all we really need to knowFound something dying, it was my lightIt had resigned itself to nightSo I threw it out a fishing lineSaid catch your reel and then catch mineOh, Annie, let's not waitLet's cross the river nowWe could sit for yearsStaring at our fearsOh, they're such pretty thingsThey're so cuteBut in the end they're just a suitOh, Annie, let's not waitTime's not on our sideWell it never wasWe know that deep insideOh just look at youWith your ruffled hairOh I love you and that's all you need to knowAnnie, Annie...
