Every day I have to look to the sunTo see where it was that I have come fromI have a feelin that there must be a timeWhen I'll get a chance to go home'Cause I'm so tired of being here aloneBut I'm just a traveller in timeTrying so hard to pay for my crimeIf I could go back the same way I got hereAnd see the people that I once held so nearI'd do my best to find an answer for youBut first I must wait 'til I'm set freeAnd I don't know how long that's gonna be'Cause I'm a man with a whole lot on his mindJust out there somewhere travelling in timeTravelling in TimeI've tried for so long to find some wayOf helping mankindYeah!
