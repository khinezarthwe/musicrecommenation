They put a parking lot on a piece of landWhere the supermarket used to standBefore that, they put up a bowling alleyOn the site that used to be the local palaisThat's where the big bands used to come and playMy sister went there on a SaturdayCome dancingAll her boyfriends used to come and callWhy not come dancing?It's only naturalAnother Saturday, another dateShe would be ready, but she'd always make him waitIn the hallway, in anticipationHe didn't know the night would end up in frustrationHe'd end up blowing all his wages for the weekAll for a cuddle and a peck on the cheekCome dancingThat's how they did it when I was just a kidAnd when they said come dancingMy sister always didMy sister should have come in at midnightAnd my mom would always sit up and waitIt always ended up in a big rowWhen my sister used to get home lateOut of my window I could see them in the moonlightTwo silhouettes saying good nights by the garden gateThe day they knocked down the palaisMy sister stood and criedThe day they knocked down the palaisPart of my childhood died, just diedNow I'm grown up and playing in a bandAnd there's a car park where the palais used to standMy sister's married, and she lives on an estateHer daughters go out, now it's her turn to waitShe knows they get away with things she never couldBut if I asked her, I wonder if she wouldCome dancingCome on, sister, have yourself a ballDon't be afraid to come dancingIt's only naturalCome dancingJust like the palais on a SaturdayAnd all her friends would come dancingWhile the big bands used to play
