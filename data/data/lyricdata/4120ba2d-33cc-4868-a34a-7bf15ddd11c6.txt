Wake up, dreamerIt's happening without youCut your hair and shave your beardYou squandered your chancesI'll give you a thousand poundsTo show me how you do itStop being so laissez-faireWe're all scared of the futureBeen training vipers to come for youIn your dreams to release youBeen training fighters to come for youIn your sleepAnd the ravens are leaving the towerAnd the ravens are leaving the towerAnd the ravens are leaving the towerMake your peaceI've got a taste for bloodLeave the weak, leave the youngI've got a taste for bloodI'm walking out without youYou will kill or be killedIt's about progressI've got a taste for bloodWake up, sleepyheadIt's happening without youSuch a nice guyYou tell me everything twiceWhip, crack, speed, jumpWe will run backwardsStop being so laissez-faireWe're all scared of the futureWe make plans for big timesGet bogged down, distractedWe make plans for good timesAll neon, all surfaceSo kiss me beforeIt all gets complicatedI've got a taste for bloodTaste for blood
