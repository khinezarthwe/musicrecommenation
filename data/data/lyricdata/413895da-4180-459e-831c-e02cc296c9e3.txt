Sonically we're in controlWe're the diamond in your soulImages come thick and fastFrom the future, from the pastThe film starts, the film endsNothing is said in betweenJust sudden moments from someone else's storyWill it ever be the same again?Hours filled with conversation, no attention paidToo distracting convention, no need for friendsWill it ever be the same again?Will it ever be the same again?You're original, with your own pathYou're original, got your own way (x2)Will it ever be the same again? (x2)I need to hear that againBecause a dream starts, and a dream must endMy mother told me, don't ever changeYou're original, in your own wayMy mother told me, don't ever changeYou're original, got your own pathYou're original (x2)Will it ever be the same again? (x2)I need to hear that againBecause a dream starts, and a dream must endYou're original (x5)
