While this town is busy sleepingAll the noise died awayI walk the streets to stop my weepingBut she'll never change her waysDon't fool yourselfShe was heartache from the moment that you met herMy heart feels so stillAs I try to find the will to forget her somehowOh I think I've forgotten her nowHer love is a rose pale and dyingDropping her petals in pain unknownAll full of wine the world before herBut sober with no place to goDon't fool yourselfShe was heartache from the moment that you met herMy heart is frozen stillAs I try to find the will to forget her somehowShe's somewhere out there nowOh my tears fall down as I tried to forgetHer love was a joke from the day that we metAll of the words, All of her menAll of my pain when I think back to whenRemember her hair as it shone in the sunIt was on the bed that I knew what she'd doneTell yourself over and over you wont ever need her againDon't fool yourselfShe was heartache from the moment that you met herOh my heart is frozen stillAs I try to find the will to forget her somehowShe's out there somewhere nowOhShe was heartache from the day that i first met herMy heart is frozen stillAs I try to find the will to forget you somehow'Cause I know you're somewhere out there right now
