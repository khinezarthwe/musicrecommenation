While this town is busy sleeping All the noise died away I walk the streets to stop my weeping But she'll never change her ways Don't fool yourself She was heartache from the moment that you met her My heart feels so still As I try to find the will to forget her somehow Oh I think I've forgotten her now Her love is a rose pale and dying Dropping her petals in pain unknown All full of wine the world before her But sober with no place to go Don't fool yourself She was heartache from the moment that you met her My heart is frozen still As I try to find the will to forget her somehow She's somewhere out there now Oh my tears fall down as I tried to forget Her love was a joke from the day that we met All of the words, All of her men All of my pain when I think back to when Remember her hair as it shone in the sun It was on the bed that I knew what she'd done Tell yourself over and over you wont ever need her again Don't fool yourself She was heartache from the moment that you met her Oh my heart is frozen still As I try to find the will to forget her somehow She's out there somewhere now Oh She was heartache from the day that i first met her My heart is frozen still As I try to find the will to forget you somehow' Cause I know you're somewhere out there right now
