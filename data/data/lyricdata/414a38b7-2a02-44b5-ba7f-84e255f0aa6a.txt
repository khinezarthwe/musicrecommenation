When you walk in the bar and you're dressed like a starRockin' your fuck me pumpsAnd the men notice you with your Gucci bag crewCan't tell who he's lookin' toCause you all look the same everyone knows your nameAnd that's your whole claim to fameNever miss a night cause your dream in lifeIs to be a footballer's wifeYou don't like players that's what you say-aBut you really wouldn't mind a millionaireYou don't like ballers they don't do nothing for yaBut you'd love a rich man six foot two or tallerYou're more than a fan lookin' for a manBut you end up with one-night standsHe could be your whole life if you got past one nightBut that part never goes rightIn the morning you're vexed he's onto the nextAnd you didn't even get no textDon't be too upset if they call you a sket'Cause like the news everyday you get pressedYou don't like players that's what you say-aBut you really wouldn't mind a millionaireOr them big ballers don't do nothing for yaBut you'd love a rich man six foot two or tallerYou can't sit down right 'cause your jeans are too tightAnd you're lucky it's ladies' nightWith your big empty purse every week it gets worseAt least your breasts cost more than hersSo you did Miami 'cause you got there for freeBut somehow you missed the planeYou did too much E, met somebodyAnd spent the night getting canedWithout girls like you there'd be no funWe'd go to the club and not see anyoneWithout girls like you there's no nightlifeAll those men just go home to their wivesDon't be mad at me 'cause you're pushing thirtyAnd your old tricks no longer workYou should have known from the jump that you'd always get dumpedSo dust off your fuck me pumps
