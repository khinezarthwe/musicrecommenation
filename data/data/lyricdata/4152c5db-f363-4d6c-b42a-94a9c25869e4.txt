Don't you know that I'll be around to guide youThrough your weakest moments to leave them behind youReturning nightmares only shadowsWe'll cast some light and you'll be alrightWe'll cast some light and you'll be alright for nowCrosses all over, heavy on your shouldersThe sirens inside you waiting to step forwardDisturbing silence darkens your sightWe'll cast some light and you'll be alrightWe'll cast some light and you'll be alright for nowCrosses all over the boulevardCrosses all over the boulevardCrosses all over the boulevardCrosses all over the boulevardThe streets outside your window overfloodedPeople staring they know you've been brokenRepeatedly reminded by the looks on their facesIgnore them tonight and you'll be alrightWe'll cast some light and you'll be alright
