Let's get just a little too proud That's the way it appears in a crowd But it's not quite the same So you think that you'll never get burnt Then what are you doing waiting for your turn Wait a minute So is it that we're really on trial But nothing's ever gonna change our style Let's get just a little too loud That's the way I've seen it written by the clouds but I'm so far away Thought you said i would never get hurt... Then what am I doing crawling in the dirt? Wait a minute Wait a minute Wait a minute So just give me a little smile Nothing's ever gonna change for a while
