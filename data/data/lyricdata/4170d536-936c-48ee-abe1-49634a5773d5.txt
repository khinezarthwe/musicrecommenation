Let's get just a little too proudThat's the way it appears in a crowdBut it's not quite the sameSo you think that you'll never get burntThen what are you doing waiting for your turnWait a minuteSo is it that we're really on trialBut nothing's ever gonna change our styleLet's get just a little too loudThat's the way I've seen it written by the clouds but I'm so far awayThought you said i would never get hurt...Then what am I doing crawling in the dirt?Wait a minuteWait a minuteWait a minuteSo just give me a little smileNothing's ever gonna change for a while
