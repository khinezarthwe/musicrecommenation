Space monkey in the place to be Lying in a rocket to a planet of sound Shooting the man, playing dominoes and drag An increasing population of 100 percent Space monkey in the place to be With a chemical appeal and a picture of Mary Out on a limb in the carnival of me Raising the temperature 100 degrees We're sewn together She's born to Mesmer Beside astride her I die inside her Space monkey in the place to be A mass of contradictions in a golden frame Raising the roof in a calamity way Completely meretricious of a poke in the eye Space monkey in the place to be Talk of the town with a Columbian walk Out on a limb in the carnival of me Raising the temperature 100 degrees We're sewn together She's born to Mesmer Beside I stride her I die inside her Its far to sacred Don't ever fake it And don't don't don't let me down Like you let me down before Like you let me down before Space monkey in the place to be With some free association and a hole in her head Out on a limb in the carnival of me Raising the temperature 100 degrees We're sewn together She's born to Mesmer Beside I stride her I die inside her Its far to sacred Don't ever fake it And don't don't don't let me down Like you let me down before
