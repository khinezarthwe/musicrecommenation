Go son, go down to the waterAnd see the women weeping thereThen go up into the mountainsThe men, they are weeping tooFather, why are all the women weeping?They are all weeping for their menThen why are all the men there weeping?They are weeping back at themThis is a weeping songA song in which to weepWhile all the men and women sleepThis is a weeping songBut I won't be weeping longFather, why are all the children weeping?They are merely crying sonO, are they merely crying, father?Yes, true weeping is yet to comeThis is a weeping songA song in which to weepWhile all the little children sleepThis is a weeping songBut I won't be weeping longO father tell me, are you weeping?Your face seems wet to touchO then I'm so sorry, fatherI never thought I hurt you so muchThis is a weeping songA song in which to weepWhile we rock ourselves to sleepThis is a weeping songBut I won't be weeping longBut I won't be weeping longBut I won't be weeping longBut I won't be weeping long
