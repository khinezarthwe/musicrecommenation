You must treat your lover girl right If you wanna make lover's rock You must know a place you can kiss To make lovers rock' Cause everybody knows it's a crying shame But nobody knows the poor baby's name When she forgot that thing that she had Oh, to swallow You western man, you're free with your seed When you make lovers rock But whoops, there goes the strength that you need To make real cool lovers rock Cause a genuine lover takes off his clothes And he can make a lover in a thousand go's And she don't need that thing that she had Oh, to swallow Everybody knows it's a crying shame But nobody knows the poor baby's name When she forgot that thing that she had Oh, to swallow Oh, rock They call it lover's rock
