Maybe it's because I'm only startingThat I think it won't take too longMaybe it's because I can see you laughingThat I think you've got it wrongMaybe I could be like Robin HoodLike an outlaw dressed all in greenSomeone said what's he gonna turn out likeAnd someone else said never mindWell I was big and bold and more than twice as oldAs all the cats I'd ever seenI grew my hair and bought a suitOf shiny white or was it creamI shook and shivered danced and quiveredAnd stood on a mountain topNo one came from miles around and saidMan your music is really hotWell I knew what they meant because I was a freakMy throat was tired and wornMy pretty face just looked out of placeAs they poured on the scornI wrote on yellow paper from a man who was the kingHe said, "My boy, we'll have some crazy scenes"There weren't any scenes at all like he was talkin' aboutHe must've been the king of queensWell I could write a million songs about the things I've doneBut I could never sing them so they'd never get sungThere's a law for the rich and one for the poorAnd there's another one for singersIt's die young and live much longerSpend your money and sit and wonderNo one came for miles aroundAnd said man your music is really funkyI believe that I must tell the truthAnd say things as they really areBut if I told the truth and nothing but the truthCould I ever be a star?Nobody knows who's real and who's fakin'Everyone's shouting out loudIt's only the glitter and shine that gets throughWhere's my Robin Hood outfit?Well I've come and I've gone before you wink an eyeNo one ever cared enough to say goodbyeThe money's good and the time you haveFun and games galoreBut you spend your money and lie in bed forgottenAnd you wonder what you did it forNo one came from miles aroundAnd said man who's he?
