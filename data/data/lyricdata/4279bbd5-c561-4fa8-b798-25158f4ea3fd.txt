A short delay, the parrot bluesLittle voices mimic youIt's not so hard to make that soundSo watch your back, the Ides of MarchCut your hair like Joan of ArcDisguise your will, they'll find you outAnd when they doLook outThere's money-lenders inside the templeThat circus tiger's gonna break your heartSomething so wild turned into paperIf I loved you, well that's my faultA bitch in heat, the alpha maleNot something she'd ever tellExcept when she got deathly highAnd out it came like summer rainIt washed the cars and everythingFelt clean for just a little whileA telethonWe drunk dialedThose starving children they ain't got no motherThere's pink flamingos living in the mallI'd give a fortune to your infomercialIf somebody would just take my callTake my callTake my callHelloPatterns in my mind now moving slowSorrow all across the surface rollsSmoothing out the edges of the stoneThe lights are out. Where'd everybody go?AloneErase yourself and you'll be freeMandala destroyed by the seaAll we are is colored sandSo pay to ride the ferris wheelSmile, all that you can feelIs gratitude for what has been'Cause it did notHappenThere's money-lenders inside the templeThat circus tiger's gonna break my heartSomething so wild turned into paperIf you love me, then that's your faultThere's money-lenders inside the templeThis crystal city's gonna fall apartWhen all their power turns into vaporIf I miss you, well that's my faultThat's my faultThat's my fault
