Everybody is talking about the girl who went and killed the delivery manBut she looks so kind and gentle, it just doesn't stand to reasonI saw her right there just the other night as stately as a slot machineBut when she looked my way something mad as hell came over meAnesthesia, Mona LisaI've got a little gun, here comes oblivionI never loved you, how did you find me?The cops will never prove complicity nowNow Anna1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8All good children go to heavenI remember your face that august night when we lied about the beautiful time to comeAnd that crazy old man who came much too late and caused a chain reactionI've been hanging out there for eleven long years like a church mouse wondering where the cat has goneAnd looking at you now is driving me to distractionAnesthesia, my Mona LisaI've got a little gun, here comes oblivionI never loved you, how did you find me?The cops will never prove complicityNow Anna1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8All good children go to heaven
