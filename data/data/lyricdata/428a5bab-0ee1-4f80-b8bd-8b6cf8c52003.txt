And you sold it to her,now you feel fooled.She's the one gone bad.She'll do it anyway,and take the lead and say.She won't be kind, norealise...Coz she's too nice to you,and you're too nice to her.You don't let each other burn.Gay prarie.Coz you know comes a time,when love will unwind.Somebody suffers,what's new?Still you.So you know that it's over.Love can damage your health.You don't put up a fight,if you don't let each other get worried.You know there's a time,so don't let down your guard,even keep up your shield.Coz she doesn't care,just what they say.So you know that it's over.Love can damage your health....new song incomingI brought you something close to me,left for something you see though you're here.You haunt my dreams,there's nothing to do but believe,just believe.Just breathe.Breathe.Stop breathing.Breathe.Stop breathing.Breathe.Stop breathing...
