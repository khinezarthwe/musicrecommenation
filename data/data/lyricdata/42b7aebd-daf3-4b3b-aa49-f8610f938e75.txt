It was your hair that did it It was your hair that lit the fuse A golden-brown halo Like sunlight peeling through trees I ask you for the time But I am asking for so much more A moth to your light bulb You made my heart beat faster Paralyse me with your kiss Wipe those dirty hands on me Maybe we're looking for the same thing Maybe you're the one who'll complete me Oh, how beauteous Your lips and eyes and your fingertips The spark of desire On every point our bodies meet Behind your eyes were stars Infinite and serene How I could suffer for you You fascinate and magnetise me Paralyse me with your kiss Wipe those dirty hands on me Maybe we're looking for the same thing Maybe you're the one who'll complete me Sometimes I think I was thrown away In this sadness To weigh me down Paralyse me with your kiss Wipe those dirty hands on me Maybe we're looking for the same thing Maybe you're the one who'll complete me
