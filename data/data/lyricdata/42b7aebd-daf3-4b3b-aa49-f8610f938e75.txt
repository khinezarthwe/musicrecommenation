It was your hair that did itIt was your hair that lit the fuseA golden-brown haloLike sunlight peeling through treesI ask you for the timeBut I am asking for so much moreA moth to your light bulbYou made my heart beat fasterParalyse me with your kissWipe those dirty hands on meMaybe we're looking for the same thingMaybe you're the one who'll complete meOh, how beauteousYour lips and eyes and your fingertipsThe spark of desireOn every point our bodies meetBehind your eyes were starsInfinite and sereneHow I could suffer for youYou fascinate and magnetise meParalyse me with your kissWipe those dirty hands on meMaybe we're looking for the same thingMaybe you're the one who'll complete meSometimes I thinkI was thrown awayIn this sadnessTo weigh me downParalyse me with your kissWipe those dirty hands on meMaybe we're looking for the same thingMaybe you're the one who'll complete me
