I can settle downAnd be doing just fineTill I hear an old freightGoing down the lineThen I hurry straightHome and packAnd if I didn't goI believe I'd blow my stackI love you babyBut you must understandWhen the Lord made meHe made a ramblin' manSome folks may say (Got my loving arms to keep you warm)That I'm no good (In the kitchen cooking up a storm)That I wouldn't settle (If uncle tells me stay away from you)Down if I could (That is something I could never do)But when that open road (You're my baby, you're my loving man)Starts calling me (When you're in trouble, do the best you can)There's something over the hill (I'm naked daddy just for you)That I've gotta see (Force of nature and you're coming through)Sometimes it's hard (Loving you, going hot and cold)But you gotta understand (Loving you, getting good and soaked)When the Lord made me (How I know you hate to see me cry)He made a ramblin' man (Happens every time I say goodbye)I love to see (What's the use, you poor seductive man)The towns passing by (Don't get feelings and you'll understand)And to ride these rails (Lying on somebody just like me)'Neath God's blue skies (Got you dancing to my melody)Let me travel this land (God knows how I need your loving arms)From the mountains to the sea (If you lose me baby, telephone)Cause that's the life (Try to pieces, stay away from harm)I believe He meant for me (You're my baby though you do me wrong)And when I'm gone (Love your nature, though I walk the line)And at my grave you stand (Loving dreams, you're just a waste of time)Just say God's called (Baby please don't stay away too long)Home his ramblin' man (Fire's burning for when you get home)
