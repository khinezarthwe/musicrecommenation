I can settle down And be doing just fine Till I hear an old freight Going down the line Then I hurry straight Home and pack And if I didn't go I believe I'd blow my stack I love you baby But you must understand When the Lord made me He made a ramblin' man Some folks may say ( Got my loving arms to keep you warm) That I'm no good ( In the kitchen cooking up a storm) That I wouldn't settle ( If uncle tells me stay away from you) Down if I could ( That is something I could never do) But when that open road ( You're my baby, you're my loving man) Starts calling me ( When you're in trouble, do the best you can) There's something over the hill ( I'm naked daddy just for you) That I've gotta see ( Force of nature and you're coming through) Sometimes it's hard ( Loving you, going hot and cold) But you gotta understand ( Loving you, getting good and soaked) When the Lord made me ( How I know you hate to see me cry) He made a ramblin' man ( Happens every time I say goodbye) I love to see ( What's the use, you poor seductive man) The towns passing by ( Don't get feelings and you'll understand) And to ride these rails ( Lying on somebody just like me)' Neath God's blue skies ( Got you dancing to my melody) Let me travel this land ( God knows how I need your loving arms) From the mountains to the sea ( If you lose me baby, telephone) Cause that's the life ( Try to pieces, stay away from harm) I believe He meant for me ( You're my baby though you do me wrong) And when I'm gone ( Love your nature, though I walk the line) And at my grave you stand ( Loving dreams, you're just a waste of time) Just say God's called ( Baby please don't stay away too long) Home his ramblin' man ( Fire's burning for when you get home)
