I was staring at the sky Just looking for a star To pray on or wish on Or something like that I was having a sweet fix Of a daydream of a boy Whose reality, I knew, Was a hopeless to be had But then the dove of hope Began its downward slope And I believed for a moment that My chances were Approaching to be grabbed But as it came down near, So did a weary tear I thought it was a bird, But it was just a paper bag Hunger hurts, And I want him so bad, oh it kills' Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up I got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold Hunger hurts but starvin' works When it costs too much to love And I went crazy again today Looking for a strand to climb Looking for a little hope Baby said he couldn't stay Wouldn't put his lips to mine A fail to kiss is a fail to cope I said, " Honey, I don't feel so good, Don't feel justified. Come on put a little love here in my void" He said " It's all in your head" And I said " So's everything" But he didn't get it I thought he was a man But he was just a little boy Hunger hurts, and I want him So bad, oh it kills' Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up I got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold Hunger hurts, but starving works When it costs... too much to love Hunger hurts, but I want him so bad, oh it kills' Cause I know I am a mess that he don't wanna clean up I got to fold because these hands are just too shaky to hold Hunger hurts, but starving works me When it costs... too much to love Hunger hurts, but I want him so bad, oh it kills me Because I know that I'm a mess that he don't wanna clean up I got to fold because these hands are just too shaky to hold Hunger hurts, but starving, it works When it costs too much to love
