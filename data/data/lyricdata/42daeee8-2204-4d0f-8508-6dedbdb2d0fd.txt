I was staring at the skyJust looking for a starTo pray on or wish onOr something like thatI was having a sweet fixOf a daydream of a boyWhose reality, I knew,Was a hopeless to be hadBut then the dove of hopeBegan its downward slopeAnd I believed for a moment thatMy chances wereApproaching to be grabbedBut as it came down near,So did a weary tearI thought it was a bird,But it was just a paper bagHunger hurts,And I want him so bad, oh it kills'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean upI got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to holdHunger hurts but starvin' worksWhen it costs too much to loveAnd I went crazy again todayLooking for a strand to climbLooking for a little hopeBaby said he couldn't stayWouldn't put his lips to mineA fail to kiss is a fail to copeI said, "Honey, I don't feel so good,Don't feel justified.Come on put a little love here in my void"He said "It's all in your head"And I said "So's everything"But he didn't get itI thought he was a manBut he was just a little boyHunger hurts, and I want himSo bad, oh it kills'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean upI got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to holdHunger hurts, but starving worksWhen it costs... too much to loveHunger hurts, but I want him so bad, oh it kills'Cause I know I am a mess that he don't wanna clean upI got to fold because these hands are just too shaky to holdHunger hurts, but starving works meWhen it costs... too much to loveHunger hurts, but I want him so bad, oh it kills meBecause I know that I'm a mess that he don't wanna clean upI got to fold because these hands are just too shaky to holdHunger hurts, but starving, it worksWhen it costs too much to love
