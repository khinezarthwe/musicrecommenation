I hear you breathe so far from meI feel your touch so close and realAnd I knowMy church is not of silver and gold,Its glory lies beyond judgement of soulsThe commandments are of consolation and warmthYou know our sacred dream won't failThe sanctuary tender and so frailThe sacrament of loveThe sacrament of warmth is trueThe sacrament is youI hear you weep so far from hereI taste your tears like you're next to meAnd I knowMy weak prayers are not enough to healThe ancient wounds so deep and so dearThe revelation is our hatred and fearYou know our sacred dream won't failThe sanctuary tender and so frailThe sacrament of loveThe sacrament of warmth is trueThe sacrament is youThe sacrament is youThe sacrament is youThe sacrament is youThe sacrament is youYou know our sacred dream won't failThe sanctuary tender and so frailThe sacrament of loveThe sacrament of warmth is trueThe sacrament is you(The sacrament is you)You know our sacred dream won't fail(The sacrament is you)The sanctuary tender and so frail(The sacrament is you)The sacrament of loveThe sacrament of warmth is trueThe sacrament is you
