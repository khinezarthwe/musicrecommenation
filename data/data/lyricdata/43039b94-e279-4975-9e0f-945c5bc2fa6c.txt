I should never think What's in your heart What's in our home So I won't You'll learn to hate me Still call me baby Oh love So call me by my name And save your soul Save your soul Before you're too far gone Before nothing can be done I'll try to decide when She'll lie in the end I ain't got no fight in me In this whole damn world Telling you, hold off She should hold off It's one thing that I've known Once I put my coat on I'm coming out in this all wrong She's standing outside and holding me Saying, oh please I'm in love I'm in love Girl your soul Oh, save your soul Before you're too far gone Before nothing can be done' Cause without me You've got it all So hold on Without me you got it all Hold on Without me you got it all Without me you got it all So hold on Without me you got it all So hold on Without me you got it all So hold on
