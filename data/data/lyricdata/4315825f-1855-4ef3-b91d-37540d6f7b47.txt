It's two in the morning And I'm calling your name Your voice on the line is So far away And my heart reaches out there And finds you gone You walk a path lonely But you're never alone And I'm begging you please Please Let me in Pleaseplease Let me in I know there are times when In ashes you lie Each one has a shadow We can't deny But there in your darkness Living your pain Wanna wrap you in love, babe Again and again I'm begging you please Please Let me in Pleaseplease Let me in Listen my tiney one Gonna make it on your own Look at what we have done to heal Please please Let me in Pleaseplease Let me in I'm begging you I'm begging you I'm begging you Pleaseplease Please
