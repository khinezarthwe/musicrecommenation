It's two in the morningAnd I'm calling your nameYour voice on the line isSo far awayAnd my heart reaches out thereAnd finds you goneYou walk a path lonelyBut you're never aloneAnd I'm begging you pleasePleaseLet me inPleasepleaseLet me inI know there are times whenIn ashes you lieEach one has a shadowWe can't denyBut there in your darknessLiving your painWanna wrap you in love, babeAgain and againI'm begging you pleasePleaseLet me inPleasepleaseLet me inListen my tiney oneGonna make it on your ownLook at what we have done to healPlease pleaseLet me inPleasepleaseLet me inI'm begging youI'm begging youI'm begging youPleasepleasePlease
