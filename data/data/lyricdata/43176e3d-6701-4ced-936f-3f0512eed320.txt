Oh she was young in her mind but the days, they were old and tiredAlong came love, she had yearned for so long, she felt on fireShe'd do anything for himShe'd do anything for himOh he was close as the label in a shirt, never left her sideOh he would lace handkerchief in the rain if she ever walked byHe'd do anything for herHe'd do anything for herHold back and kiss slowOh the lights out in your cold heart nowHold back and kiss slowOh the lights out in your cold heart nowStuck in a world that would pull them apart, and it cost in timeIf only they knew that ahead loomed a cloud that was black as nightShe'd do anything for himShe'd do anything for himOh they were strong, they could take on the world and put up a fightAnd even the clouds couldn't stand in the way when they held on tightHe'd do anything for herHe'd do anything for herHold back and kiss slowOh the lights out in your cold heart nowHold back and kiss slowOh the lights out in your cold heart nowDon't hold your breath too longFor white diamonds in the snowDon't hold your breath too longFor white diamonds in the snowHold back and kiss slowOh the lights out in your cold heart nowHold back and kiss slowOh the lights out in your cold heart now
