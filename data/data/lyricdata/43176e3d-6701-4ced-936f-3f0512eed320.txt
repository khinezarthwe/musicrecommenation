Oh she was young in her mind but the days, they were old and tired Along came love, she had yearned for so long, she felt on fire She'd do anything for him She'd do anything for him Oh he was close as the label in a shirt, never left her side Oh he would lace handkerchief in the rain if she ever walked by He'd do anything for her He'd do anything for her Hold back and kiss slow Oh the lights out in your cold heart now Hold back and kiss slow Oh the lights out in your cold heart now Stuck in a world that would pull them apart, and it cost in time If only they knew that ahead loomed a cloud that was black as night She'd do anything for him She'd do anything for him Oh they were strong, they could take on the world and put up a fight And even the clouds couldn't stand in the way when they held on tight He'd do anything for her He'd do anything for her Hold back and kiss slow Oh the lights out in your cold heart now Hold back and kiss slow Oh the lights out in your cold heart now Don't hold your breath too long For white diamonds in the snow Don't hold your breath too long For white diamonds in the snow Hold back and kiss slow Oh the lights out in your cold heart now Hold back and kiss slow Oh the lights out in your cold heart now
