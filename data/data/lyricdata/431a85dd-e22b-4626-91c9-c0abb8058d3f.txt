A look of terminal shock in your eyes Now things are really what they seem No, this is no bad dream Bleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a scream Wave upon wave of demented avengers March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream Have you heard the news? The dogs are dead! You better stay home And do as you're told Get out of the road if you want to grow old
