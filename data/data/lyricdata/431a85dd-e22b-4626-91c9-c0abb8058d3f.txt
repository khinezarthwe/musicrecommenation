Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland awayOnly dimly aware of a certain unease in the airYou better watch outThere may be dogs aboutI've looked over Jordan, and I have seenThings are not what they seemWhat do you get for pretending the danger's not realMeek and obedient, you follow the leaderDown well-trodden corridors, into the valley of steelWhat a surprise!A look of terminal shock in your eyesNow things are really what they seemNo, this is no bad dreamBleating and babbling we fell on his neck with a screamWave upon wave of demented avengersMarch cheerfully out of obscurity into the dreamHave you heard the news?The dogs are dead!You better stay homeAnd do as you're toldGet out of the road if you want to grow old
