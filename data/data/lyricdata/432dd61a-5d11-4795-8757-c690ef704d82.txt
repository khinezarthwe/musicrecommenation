And there were future reflections on the face and the handsOn a green-colored island on a primitive manIt was the future reflecting, it felt familiar but newA street was missing a building, the kids had something to doThere was a feeling, the spirit was leavingRed like a markerSo my tribe, with my knifeCut the heart from a lonely lifeI saw patterns on floorboards deep in the dust was a leaderSomeone was walking on floorboards, turned them from oak into cedarHe can assess the situation, I wrapped a string around my fingerInto the forest with the young ones, I don't expect to be a winnerBut as long as you feel it, I'm a believerMy heart is phosphorSea rolls and death tollsBreak the surface, don't break my bonesOff of the trail and off of your hands andOnto a new planIs the cost to stay lostForever in an empty skin, pale and thinIf it's good, or if it's fortune, I can't tellBut pieces come together for some reason just as wellTheir guns couldn't see us, there's a sea outside my doorAnd one day I'll appreciate the rush of blood and the washed out beat of the shoreAnd remember what it felt likeTo be aloneSitting in the sunlightAll alone
