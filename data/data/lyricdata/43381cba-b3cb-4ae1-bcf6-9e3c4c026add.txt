This isn't your songThis isn't your musicHow can they be wrongWhen by committee they choose it all?They choose it allYou're gonna grow oldYou're gonna grow coldBearing signs on the avenueFor your own personal WaterlooYou're bearing signs on the avenueFor your own personal Waterloo nowWe'll fight, we'll fightWe'll fight for your music halls and dying citiesThey'll fight, they'll fightThey'll fight for your neural walls and plasticitiesAnd precious territoryThis isn't our songThis isn't even a musicalI think life is too longTo be a whale in a cubicleNails under your cuticleGonna grow oldYou're gonna grow so coldBefore this song can deliver youYou're bearing signs on the avenueYou're bearing signsFor your own personal Waterloo nowWe'll fight, we'll fightWe'll fight for your music halls and dying citiesThey'll fight, they'll fightThey'll fight for your neural walls and plasticitiesAnd precious territory
