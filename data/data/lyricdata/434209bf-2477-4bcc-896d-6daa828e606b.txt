Nothing here to fearI'm just sitting around being foolish when there is work to be doneJust a hang-up callAnd the quiet breathing of our Persian we call Cajun on a WednesdaySo we go from year to year with secrets we've been keepingThough you say you're not a Templar manSeems as if we're circling for very different reasonsBut one day the eagle has to landOut past the fountain, a left by the stationI start the day in the usual wayThen think, well, why not, and stop for a coffeeAnd begin to recall things that you sayNo one's at the doorYou suggest a ghost, perhaps a phantom, I agree with this in partSomething is with usI can't put my finger on, is Thumbelina size ten on a WednesdaySo we go from year to year with secrets we've been keepingThough you say you're not a Templar manYou tell me to cheer up, you suspect we're oddly evenEven still the eagle has to landOut past the fountain, a left by the stationI start the day in the usual wayThen think, well, why not, and stop for a coffeeAnd begin to recall things that you sayPluck up the courage and snap, it's gone againI start humming "When Doves Cry"Can someone help me, I think that I'm lost hereLost in a place called America
