Can't you seeI love youPlease don't break my heart in twoThat's not hard to do'Cause I don't have a wooden heartAnd if you say goodbyeThen I know that I would cryMaybe I would die'Cause I don't have a wooden heartThere's no strings upon this love of mineIt was always you from the startTreat me niceTreat me goodTreat me like you really should'Cause I'm not made of woodAnd I don't have a wooden heartMuss i denn, muss i dennZum Städtele hinausStädtele hinausUnd du, mein Schatz, bleibst hier?There's no strings upon this love of mineIt was always you from the startSei mir gutSei mir gutSei mir wie du wirklich sollstWie du wirklich sollst'Cause I don't have a wooden heart
