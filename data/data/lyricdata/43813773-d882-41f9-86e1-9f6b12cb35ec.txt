Cover me, cover me, comfort me, comfort meCover me, cover me, comfort me, comfort meI had a dream, no longer to be freeI want only to see, four walls made of concreteSix by six enclosed, see me on video, oh, oh, ohFeed me twice a day, I want to fade away, awayCover me, cover me, comfort me, comfort meCover me, cover me, comfort me, comfort meAnd after some time I know I would go blindBut seeing only binds the vision to the eyeI'd lose my voice, I know but I've nothing left to sayNothing left to pray, no echo in this space
