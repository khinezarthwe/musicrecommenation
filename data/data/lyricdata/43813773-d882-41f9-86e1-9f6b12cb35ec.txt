Cover me, cover me, comfort me, comfort me Cover me, cover me, comfort me, comfort me I had a dream, no longer to be free I want only to see, four walls made of concrete Six by six enclosed, see me on video, oh, oh, oh Feed me twice a day, I want to fade away, away Cover me, cover me, comfort me, comfort me Cover me, cover me, comfort me, comfort me And after some time I know I would go blind But seeing only binds the vision to the eye I'd lose my voice, I know but I've nothing left to say Nothing left to pray, no echo in this space
