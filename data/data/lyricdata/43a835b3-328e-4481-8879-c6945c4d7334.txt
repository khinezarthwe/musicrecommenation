Paper flowersPaper flowersI linger in the doorwayOf alarm clocks screamingMonsters calling my nameLet me stayWhere the wind will whisper to meWhere the raindropsAs they're falling tell a storyIn my field of paper flowersAnd candy clouds of lullaby (paper flowers)I lie inside myself for hoursAnd watch my purple sky fly over me (paper flowers)Don't say I'm out of touchWith this rampant chaos - your realityI know well what lies beyond my sleeping refugeThe nightmare I built my own world to escapeIn my field of paper flowersAnd candy clouds of lullaby (paper flowers)I lie inside myself for hoursAnd watch my purple sky fly over me (paper flowers)Swallowed up in the sound of my screamingCannot cease for the fear of silent nightsOh how I long for the deep sleep dreamingThe goddess of an imaginary lightIn my field of paper flowersAnd candy clouds of lullaby (paper flowers)I lie inside myself for hoursAnd watch my purple sky fly over me (paper flowers)Paper flowersPaper flowers
