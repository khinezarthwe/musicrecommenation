One thing that I just can't conceiveIs how to let you go.And if you will stay here with meThen we will always know.We will find outAs we change about.Is this the last part?Here is when we shout:One thing that I just can't conceiveIs how to let you go.These days await if we believeI'll make it to the show.We will find outAs we change about.Is this the last part?Here is when we shout:And you could say, "Your love to me,"But I was far away.And you could be a love to me,But I was far away.And you could say "Your love to me",That I was far away.And you could be a love to me,But I was far away.I've lost myself once and I seeThat I was weak at heart.And if you will stay here with meWe face the hardest part.We will find outAs we change about.Is this the last part?Here is one we shout:And you could say, "Your love to me,"But I was far away.And you could be a love to me,But I was far away.And you could say "Your love to me",That I was far away.And you could be a love to me,But I was far away.If you believe a hand on your sleeveCan pull you over,Because you know wherever you goI'll be over your shoulder.If you believe a hand on your faithCan pull you over,Because you know wherever you goI'll be over your shoulder.And you could say, "Your love to me,"But I was far away.And you could be a love to me,But I was far away.
