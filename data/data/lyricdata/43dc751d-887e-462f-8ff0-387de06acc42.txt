When you say it's dead and goneYes, I know you're wrongCut and slash, sharpest knifeIt won't diePoison cup, drank it upIt won't dieNo fire, no gun, no rope, no stoneIt won't dieWhy you gotta shove it in my faceAs if you put me in my place?'Cause I don't care if you or me is wrong or rightAin't gonna spend another nightIn your bedIn your bedLaws of man are just pretendThey ain't mineLove so good, love so badIt won't dieSome talk too long, they know it allI just smile and move onWords ain't free, like you and meI don't mindWhy'd you have to be so mean and cruel?The dogs are loose, I'm on to youYou ball and chained together from the dawn to duskCan't call it leavin', 'cause it's justI never cameI never cameI never cameI never cameI never cameI never came
