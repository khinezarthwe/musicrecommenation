I had a heart attack and boy it brought me back To where I was before I started to believe in myself I didn't need no gun I didn't need no sword I didn't even know the meaning of the terrible war I didn't need you And you didn't need me And no matter what you told My god you sold your soul And if you ever see me without home You know that's cause I want it so I just like to live a little lustful life And if it's lightning on a sunny day You know that's 'cause I want my way I just like to live a little lustful life Live a little lustful life To live a little lustful life Oh, I didn't need no fun I didn't need no cunts To tell me when to leave my door in the morning sun' Cause I know where it's at Yeah, I know where it's at It's up to every little fellow down to every cat You never needed me and I never needed you And no matter what you told My god you sold your soul And if you ever see me without home You know that's cause I want it so I just like to live a little lustful life And if it's lightning on a sunny day You know that's 'cause I want my way I just like to live a little lustful life To live a little lustful life To live a little lustful life And if you ever see me without home And if you ever see me without home And if you ever see me without home And if you ever see me without home You know that's cause I want it so I just like to live a little lustful life And if it's lightning on a sunny day You know that's 'cause I want my way I just like to live a little lustful life To live a little lustful life To live to live And to die, and to die To live to live And to die, and to die To live to live And to die, and to die To live to live And to die, and to die
