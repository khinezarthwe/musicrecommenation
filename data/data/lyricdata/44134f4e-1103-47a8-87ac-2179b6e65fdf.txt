I'm going to the darklandsTo talk in rhyme with my chaotic soulAs sure as life means nothingAnd all things end in nothingAnd heaven I think is too close to hellI want to move I want to goI want to goOh something won't let meGo to the place where the darklands areAnd I awake from dreamsTo a scary world of screamsAnd heaven I think is too close to hellI want to move I want to goI want to goTake me to the darkOh god I get down on my kneesAnd I feel like I could dieBy the river of diseaseAnd I feel that I'm dyingAnd I'm dyingI'm down on my kneesOh I'm downI want to go I want to stayI want to stay
