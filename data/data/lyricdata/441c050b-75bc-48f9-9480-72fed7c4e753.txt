An old cowboy went ridin' out one dark and windy dayUpon a ridge he rested as he went along his wayWhen all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he sawPlowin' through the ragid skies and up a cloudy drawTheir brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steelTheir horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feelA bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the skyFor he saw the riders comin' hard and he heard their mournful criesYippie i ohhh ohh ohhYippie i aye ye yeGhost riders in the skyTheir faces gaunt, their eyes were blurredTheir shirts all soaked with sweatHe's ridin' hard to catch that herdBut he ain't caught em yetCause they got to ride forever in that range up in the skyOn horses snortin' fire as they ride on hear their criesAs the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name'if you wanna save your soul from hell a-ridin' on our rangeThen cowboy change your ways today or with us you will rideTryin' to catch the devil's herd across these endless skiesYippie i ohhh oh ohYippie i aye ye yeGhost riders in the skyGhost riders in the skyGhost riders in the sky
