If I am lost for a day, try to find meBut if I don't come back, then I won't look behind meAll of the things that I thought were so easyJust got harder and harder each dayDecember is darkest and June is the lightBut this empty bedroom won't make anything rightWhile out on the landing a friend I forgot to send homeWho waits up for me all through the nightCalendar girl, who's in love with the worldStay aliveCalendar girl, who's in love with the worldStay aliveI dreamed I was dying as I so often doAnd when I awoke I was sure it was trueI ran to the window, threw my head to the skyAnd said, "Whoever is up there, please don't let me die"But I can't live forever, I can't always beOne day I'll be sand on a beach by a seaThe pages keep turning, I'll mark off each day with a crossAnd I'll laugh about all that we've lostCalendar girl, who is lost to the worldStay aliveCalendar girl, who is lost to the worldStay aliveJanuary, February, March, April, MayI'm aliveJune, July, August, September, OctoberI'm aliveNovember, December, yeah, all through the winterI'm aliveI'm alive
