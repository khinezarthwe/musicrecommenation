We were so pretty, now is this it?You and I are too young for thisNo blood, no lust or spitBut still there is something there to play uponA flash of instant thereabouts, you'll miss it and it's goneBut still it's good to be in love with someoneWhen you've always had to be with no oneShe said everyone's a story of their ownBut if we don't leave now we'll find ourselves with no way homeAnd so we strolled on all bangered and confusedAt first it wasn't pretty but we soon undid that rouse soNow we got something in many other waysAll the boys together and a knees up on the wayStill it's good to be in love with someoneWhen you've always had to be with no oneShe said everyone's a story of their ownBut if we don't leave now we'll find ourselves with no way homeFind ourselves with no way homeAnd it occurred to me, I think on Lambeth RoadThere's no more need to question lifeOr cry for what I'm owedAnd now it's over, so now it's doneThe English sun is setting and the rude boys on the run, ohStill it's good to be in love with someoneWhen you've always had to be with no oneAnd yes I need you to remind me every dayThe lives and loves we've lost and broken on the wayHere's to tomorrow and the lonely streets we'll roamBut if we don't leave now we'll find ourselves with no way homeJust to think we're almost home
