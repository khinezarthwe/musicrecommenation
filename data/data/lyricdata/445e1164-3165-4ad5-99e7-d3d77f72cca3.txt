Cry, cry for youJust like you knew I wouldn't doCry, cry for youJust like a song in the last lightShould I leave it all awayNot like the kindness that you gaveThat's why it never seems the sameBehind your eyesI stood behind when no one asked meAnd took you home after the fightI drove my car into city lightsDrove down the road that I am onCry, cry for youThat's what you think I want to beCry, cry for youAn empty heart that sees me throughCry, cry for youJust like you knew I wouldn't doCry cry for youJust like a song in the last lightCry, cry for you
