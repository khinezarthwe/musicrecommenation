I have never felt such frustrationOr lack of self controlI want you to kill meAnd dig me under, I wanna live no moreOne who doesn't care is one who shouldn't beI've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for meFor meI want to taste dirty, stinging pistolIn my mouth, on my tongueI want you to scrape me from the wallsAnd go crazy like you've made meOne who doesn't care is one who shouldn't beI've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for meFor meYou, you are so specialYou have the talent to make me feel like dirtAnd you, you use your talent to dig me underAnd cover me with dirtOne who doesn't care is one who shouldn't beI've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
