Shuffle can to can nobody really gives a damnFor every living day I give myself a handNow I'm scroungy as can beI got all you normals looking at meI'll scratch a hole in my lifeSo everyone can seeMy mind is a mind that I have come to knowAnd my eyes can't conceive a world that can not growAnd Fridays are always fresh daysScreamin' at the sun, don't reallyKnow what he has doneHe don't believe in God and a world as oneSo he rambles through the weedsAnd he will sleep beneath the treesMy mind is a mind that I have come to knowAnd my eyes can't conceive a world that can not growOn the day I die, Thank God my Soul will be releasedI've seen all your eyesAnd I've seen all your facesCan you tell me honestly that you wanna be free?Then look in my eyesI've been lots of placesCan you tell me honestly that you'd want to be meHonestly.
