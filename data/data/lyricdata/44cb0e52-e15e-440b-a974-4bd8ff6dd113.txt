Suddenly, you move away from me What more is there that I can be If you move away from me? You and I drawing I was alone in your room When there on the floor I saw a little black book You left it there on the floor, open And I opened and it is Your diary It's open and inviting me back You couldn't say why you loved him He's asking you why you loved him You couldn't say why you loved him But he gave you a list Of all the reasons why he did And you couldn't reply But you could say that you did Your diary It's open and inviting me back You said he had lips like petals Unfurling from a bud I could've ripped page and petals Ripped to the blood Ripped and torn, ripping Was all of that good? But I didn't and don't Want you ever to read Any diary of mine Any word I may leave, now Your diary It's open and inviting me back
