Right under my feet, there's air made of bricksPulls me down, turns me weak for youI find myself repeating like a broken tuneAnd I'm forever excusing your intentionsAnd I give in to my pretendingsWhich forgive you each timeWithout me knowingThey melt my heart to stoneAnd I hear your words that I made upYou say my name like there could be an usI best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in loveI'm the only one in loveEach and every time I turn around to leaveI feel my heart begin to burst and bleedSo desperately I try to link it with my headBut instead I fall back to my kneesAs you tear your way right through meI forgive you once againWithout me knowingYou've burnt my heart to stoneAnd I hear your words that I made upYou say my name like there could be an usI best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in loveI'm the only one in loveWhy do you steal my handWhenever I'm standing my own ground?You build me up, then leave me deadWell, I hear your words you made upSo I say your name like there should be an usI best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in loveI'm the only one in love
