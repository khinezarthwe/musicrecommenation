With your bright yellow gunYou own the sunAnd I think I need a little poisonTo keep me tameKeep me awakeI have nothing to offer but confusionAnd the circus in my headAnd the middle of the bedIn the middle of the nightWith your bright silver frownYou own the townAnd I think I need a little poisonI have no secretsI have no liesI have nothing to offerBut the middle of the nightAnd I think you need a little poisonYou leak one apple a week to surviveAnd you still have to ask if you're aliveYou have nothing to offerBut police my dreamsKeep me cleanKeep me awakeWith your bright yellow gunYou own the sunAnd I think I need a little poisonWith your bright silver grinYou own sinAnd I think I need a little poisonAnd I think I need a little poisonAnd I think I need a little poisonBright yellow gunBright yellow gunBright yellow gunBright yellow gunBright yellow gunBright yellow gun
