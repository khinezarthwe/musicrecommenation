The trail is dark and dustyThe road is kinda roughBut the road up yonderWith the cinders on the side.Trails of troublesAnd your road of battle,They lead paths of victoryWe shall walkI walked out to the valleyTurned my head up high.Seen that silver linin'That was hangin' in the skyTrails of troublesAnd your road of battles,In the paths of victoryWe shall walkThe mountain was a-movin'The hummin' of its wheels,Told me of the new dayThat was coming across the fieldsTrails of troublesAnd roads of battles,They lead paths of victoryWe shall walkThe gravel road is bumpy,It's a hard old road to ride,But the good road is waitin'And the boys it ain't far off.Trails of troublesAnd your roads of battle,They lead paths of victoryWe shall walk
