The trail is dark and dusty The road is kinda rough But the road up yonder With the cinders on the side. Trails of troubles And your road of battle, They lead paths of victory We shall walk I walked out to the valley Turned my head up high. Seen that silver linin' That was hangin' in the sky Trails of troubles And your road of battles, In the paths of victory We shall walk The mountain was a-movin' The hummin' of its wheels, Told me of the new day That was coming across the fields Trails of troubles And roads of battles, They lead paths of victory We shall walk The gravel road is bumpy, It's a hard old road to ride, But the good road is waitin' And the boys it ain't far off. Trails of troubles And your roads of battle, They lead paths of victory We shall walk
