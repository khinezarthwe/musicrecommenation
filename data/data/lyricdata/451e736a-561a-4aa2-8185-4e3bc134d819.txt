The red moon is rising behind youThe ocean is pounding awayI held up a light to the smoke butThe redness blows it awayAnd the night is coldAnd the clouds go byTomorrow morningI hope to be homeBy your sideThe riptide is pulling me underI'm drifting, drifting awayTomorrow the sun will be brighterThe water will rise and wash us awayBut the stars are coldAnd the air is brightAnd I see you nowYou shine like the steel on my knifeThe darkness is wrapped all around me tonightI miss youI miss you there's no one elseI doI do
