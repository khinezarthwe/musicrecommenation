I like to dreamYes, yes, right between my sound machineOn a cloud of sound, I drift in the nightAny place it goes is rightGoes far, flies nearTo the stars away from hereWell, you don't know what we can findWhy don't you come with me, little girl, on a magic carpet ride?You don't know what we can seeWhy don't you tell your dreams to me? Fantasy will set you freeClose your eyes, girlLook inside, girlLet the sound take you awayLast night I held Aladdin's lampAnd so I wished that I could stayBefore the thing could answer meWell, someone came and took the lamp awayI looked aroundA lousy candle's all I foundWell, you don't know what we can findWhy don't you come with me, little girl, on a magic carpet ride?Well, you don't know what we can seeWhy don't you tell your dreams to me? Fantasy will set you freeClose your eyes, girlLook inside, girlLet the sound take you awayYou don't know what we can findWhy don't you come with me, little girl, on a magic carpet ride?Well, you don't know what we can seeWhy don't you tell your dreams to me? Fantasy will set you free
