I once had a girl or should I sayShe once had meShe showed me her room, isn't it goodNorwegian wood?She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhereSo I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chairI sat on a rug biding my timeDrinking her wineWe talked until two and then she said:"It's time for bed"She told me she worked in the morning and started to laughI told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bathAnd when I awoke I was aloneThis bird had flownSo I lit a fire, isn't it goodNorwegian wood?
