So the saying says "an elephant never forgets"Standing in a concrete caveSwaying sad and insaneThey walked over the ocean in their dreams they dream awakeUntil the lights grew dimUntil the cop cars cameEverybody tells me this is crazy yes, I know itI'm a man-man-man, man-man-man eaterBut still you're surprised-prised-prised when I eat yaYou know they call them killer whalesBut you seem surprised when it pinned you downTo the bottom of the tankWhere you can't turn aroundIt took half your leg and both your lungsWhen I craved I ate hearts of sharks, I know you know itI'm a man-man-man, man-man-man eaterBut still you're surprised-prised-prised when I eat yaYes I'm a man-man-man, man-man, man-eaterBut still you're surprised-prised-prised when I eat yaIt will end again in bullets firedIt will end again in bullets fired
