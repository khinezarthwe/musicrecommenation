So the saying says "an elephant never forgets" Standing in a concrete cave Swaying sad and insane They walked over the ocean in their dreams they dream awake Until the lights grew dim Until the cop cars came Everybody tells me this is crazy yes, I know it I'm a man-man-man, man-man-man eater But still you're surprised-prised-prised when I eat ya You know they call them killer whales But you seem surprised when it pinned you down To the bottom of the tank Where you can't turn around It took half your leg and both your lungs When I craved I ate hearts of sharks, I know you know it I'm a man-man-man, man-man-man eater But still you're surprised-prised-prised when I eat ya Yes I'm a man-man-man, man-man, man-eater But still you're surprised-prised-prised when I eat ya It will end again in bullets fired It will end again in bullets fired
