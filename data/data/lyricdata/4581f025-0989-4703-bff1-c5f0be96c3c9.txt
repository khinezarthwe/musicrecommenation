Blue Songs are like tattoos You know I've been to sea before Crown and Anchor me Or let me sail away Hey blue, here is a song for you Ink on a pin Underneath the skin An empty space to fill in Well there are so many sinking now You've got to keep thinking You can make it through these waves Acid, booze, and ass Needles, guns, and grass Lots of laughs, Lots of laughs Everybody's saying that hells the hippest way to go Well I don't think so But I'm gonna take a look around it though Blue, I love you Blue, here is a shell for you Inside you'll hear a sigh A foggy lullaby There is your song from me
