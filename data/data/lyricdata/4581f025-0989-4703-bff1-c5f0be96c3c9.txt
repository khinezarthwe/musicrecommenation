BlueSongs are like tattoosYou know I've been to sea beforeCrown and Anchor meOr let me sail awayHey blue, here is a song for youInk on a pinUnderneath the skinAn empty space to fill inWell there are so many sinking nowYou've got to keep thinkingYou can make it through these wavesAcid, booze, and assNeedles, guns, and grassLots of laughs,Lots of laughsEverybody's saying that hells the hippest way to goWell I don't think soBut I'm gonna take a look around it thoughBlue, I love youBlue, here is a shell for youInside you'll hear a sighA foggy lullabyThere is your song from me
