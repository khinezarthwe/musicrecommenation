Girl, you know I did itIt's over and I feel fineNothing you can say is gonna change my mindWaited, and I waited the longest nightNothing like the taste of sweet declineI went down and I fell, I fell so fastDropping like the grains in an hourglassNever say forever 'cause nothing lastsDancing with the bones of my buried pastNever mind there's nothing I could doBet your life there's something killing youIt's a shame we have to die my dearNo one's getting out of here aliveThis timeWhat a way to go but have no fearNo one's getting out of here aliveThis timeI'm finished, I'm getting you off my chestMade you come clean in a dirty dressA promise is a promise you kept in checkHard to cross a heart that beats its fistTake a good hard look for the very last timeThe very last one in a very long lineOnly took a second to say goodbyeBeen a pleasure, but the pleasure's been mine all mineNever mind there's nothing I could do(Never mind there's nothing I could do)Bet your life there's something killing youIt's a shame we have to die my dearNo one's getting out of here aliveThis timeWhat a way to go but have no fearNo one's getting out of here aliveThis timeAin't no wayD.O.A.Ain't no wayD.O.A.Take a good hard look for the very last timeThe very last one in a very long lineOnly took a second to say goodbyeBeen a pleasure, but the pleasure's been mine all mineNever mind there's nothing I could do(Never mind there's nothing I could do)Bet your life there's something killing youIt's a shame we have to die my dearNo one's getting out of here aliveThis timeWhat a way to go but have no fearNo one's getting out of here aliveThis timeIt's a shame we have to disappearNo one's getting out of here aliveThis timeThis timeThis time
