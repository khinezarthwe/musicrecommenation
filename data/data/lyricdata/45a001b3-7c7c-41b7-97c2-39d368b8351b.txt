Bury all your secrets in my skinCome away with innocence, and leave me with my sinsThe air around me still feels like a cageAnd love is just a camouflage, for what resembles rage againSo if you love me let me goAnd run away before I knowMy heart is just too dark to careI can't destroy what isn't thereDeliver me unto my fateIf I'm alone I cannot hateI don't deserve to have youOoh my smile was taken long ago, if I can change I hope I never knowI still press your letters to my lipsAnd cherish them in parts of me, that savor every kissI couldn't face a life without your light (without your light)But all of that was ripped apart, when you refused to fightSo save your breath I will not hearI think I made it very clearYou couldn't hate enough to loveIs that supposed to be enoughI only wish you weren't my friendThen I could hurt you in the endI never claimed to be a saintOoh my own was banished long ago, it took the death of hope to let you goOh ohSo break yourself against my stonesAnd spit your pity in my soulYou never needed any helpYou sold me out to save yourselfAnd I won't listen to your shameYou ran away you're all the sameAngels lie to keep controlOoh my love was punished long ago, if you still care don't ever let me knowIf you still care don't ever let me know
