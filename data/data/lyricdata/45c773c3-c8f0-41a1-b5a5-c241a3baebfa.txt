Everything is exactly rightWhen I walk around here drunk every nightWith an open container from 7-ElevenIn St. Ides HeavenBeen out haunting the neighborhoodAnd everybody can see I'm no goodWhen I'm walking out between parked carsWith my head full of starsHigh on amphetaminesThe moon is a light bulb breakingIt'll go around with anyoneBut it won't come down for anyoneYou think you know what brings me downThat I want those things you could never allowYou see me smiling, you think it's a frownTurned upside down'Cause everyone is a fucking proAnd they all got answers from trouble they've knownAnd they all gotta say what you should and shouldn't doThough they don't have a clueHigh on amphetaminesThe moon is a lightbulb breakingIt'll go around with anyoneBut it won't come down for anyoneAnd I won't come down for anyone
