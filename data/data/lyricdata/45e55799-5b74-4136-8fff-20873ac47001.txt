When the day is shortAnd the nights are longIt's a different worldWhere the rules are wrongAnd I, I will go home with whoWhoever is sureAre you sure?And I don't care if youIf you love me tomorrow justLove me tonight and II will be all rightI'll be all rightI'll be all rightUntil tomorrow nightAnd it's oh so longMeet your, meet your friends at the barAnd is that who those people are?They, they seem so very...oh, farThey seem so farIs that who they really are?And on the jukebox is yourIs your only song and II have never remembered the wordsNow I've waited, waited too longI've waited too longOur love is goneNo more sober words of loveNo more walks in the park sideNo more sweet and shy touches, yeahWe're just lovers in the darkFeel nothing, leave no markBut it was fun when we saw sparksWhen the day is shortAnd the nights are longIt's a different worldWhere the rules are wrongI'll be all rightI'll be all right
