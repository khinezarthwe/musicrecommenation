The city's beautifulIn the early morning airLove the smell of sunriseAnd everything becomes so clearI think you are beautifulAnd you know it by one lookDid you long for summertimeWhen you were growing upAnd when it finally cameIt wasn't 'round for longYou ecstatically stumbled aroundOne warm second and suddenly goneOne warm second and suddenly goneI wish that time would stand stillIf this was part of a filmWe would watch the clip all dayLike a portrait of you and ILike a portrait of you and IThe city's beautifulFeeling the morning airLove the smell of sunriseEverything becomes so clearI think you are beautifulAnd you know it by one lookDid you long for summertimeWhen you were growing upWhen your life's just a breeze in eternityWhy not take this one chance and come fly with me?Just this onceJust this second that soon will be goneIf this second was your life, what would you do?If this second was your life, I would love youIf this second was your life, would you love it?If this second was my life, I would love itIf this second was my life, I would love youIf this second was my life, I would happily dieThe city's beautifulIn the early morning airLove the smell of sunriseAnd everything becomes so clearI don't have to look to seeToday, it's all so clearChimney tops start to glowAnd that's when I will disappear
