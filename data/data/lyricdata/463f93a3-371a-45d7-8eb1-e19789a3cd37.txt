Dragon lips I say goodbyeBut baby don’t you cryBe too cool to ever beWith a tiger by your sideMoney talks a single sidePaid my dues to move the tideCaught the moonlight in my shoeWith a tiger by my sideTrekking through an open mindI got a window in my spineFelt the miracle in my stride overMaking music in my mindI’m blending colours for the blindMelt the pinnacle your times not overRabbit trips can take their timeBut fun is fun and that’s alrightDiving deep as whales sleepCounting heroes on my feetWidow in a falling starHealing scars with my guitarSirens speak to apple treeAnd the tiger plays a partSeen about a million roadsI’ve done the bong to TokyoI’ve been a clone and had a little luckSwam across the golden sea a certain price of levityIt brings us up and only makes us sleepTelevision changing channels telling people wearing flannelsCulture shocking walkways to the shoreEven though I never know and even though I never knowand even though I never want to knowTrekking through an open mindI got a window in my spineFelt the miracle in my stride overMaking music in my mindI’m blending colours for the blindMelt the pinnacle your times not overSeen about a million roadsI’ve done the bong to TokyoI’ve been a clone and had a little luckSwam across the golden sea a certain price of levityIt brings us up and only makes us sleepTelevision changing channels telling people wearing flannelsCulture shocking walkways to the shoreEven though I never know and even though I never knowand even though I never want to know
