Just because your body's humanYou don't have that much to offerWhen I'm deep inside of youI feel like there's not much to doTo satisfy your pretty yearningsSaw you dancing with the humanDesire will be your undoingYou know he'll treat you like the restYour not even second bestMorning comes you'll be forgottenEverybody needs some lovingBodies are made for movingYou don't get the feelingSo shut your mouthJust because I'm flesh and bloodDoesn't make me weak or fragileIn your eyes I acquiesceBut what it is I must confessIs just one of your dim delusionsWhat you never realizeHope you never realizeTomorrow when the morning comesI'll be ready to get homeThank you for a lovely eveningEverybody needs some lovingBodies are made for movingYou don't get the feelingSo shut your mouth
