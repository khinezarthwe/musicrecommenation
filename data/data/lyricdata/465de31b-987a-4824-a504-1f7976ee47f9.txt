Just because your body's human You don't have that much to offer When I'm deep inside of you I feel like there's not much to do To satisfy your pretty yearnings Saw you dancing with the human Desire will be your undoing You know he'll treat you like the rest Your not even second best Morning comes you'll be forgotten Everybody needs some loving Bodies are made for moving You don't get the feeling So shut your mouth Just because I'm flesh and blood Doesn't make me weak or fragile In your eyes I acquiesce But what it is I must confess Is just one of your dim delusions What you never realize Hope you never realize Tomorrow when the morning comes I'll be ready to get home Thank you for a lovely evening Everybody needs some loving Bodies are made for moving You don't get the feeling So shut your mouth
