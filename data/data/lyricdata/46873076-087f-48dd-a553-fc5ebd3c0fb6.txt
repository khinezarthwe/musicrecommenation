Breaking up in the station, a final train I don't even know if I'll ever see you again Is it a choice that we even have? Bang bang, down on the piano till I smash the keys Listening alone with the melodies Everything's gone and I don't know where And the rule of thumb don't apply anymore' Cause the house is burning Trying to pull myself away I'm caught in a pattern and I can't escape Trying to pull myself away Lately when I get lost there's this thing I know Even the dogs have somewhere to go Everything comes if you just let it be Work, work, brighten the corners that will never see Untangle the thoughts that you know what they mean I hope that the answer didn't come too late And the rule of thumb don't apply on me' Cause the tables are turning Trying to pull myself away I'm caught in a pattern and I can't escape Trying to pull myself away I'm caught in a pattern and I can't escape Can't escape Trying to pull myself away, everything's gone Trying to pull myself away, everything's gone
