Breaking up in the station, a final trainI don't even know if I'll ever see you againIs it a choice that we even have?Bang bang, down on the piano till I smash the keysListening alone with the melodiesEverything's gone and I don't know whereAnd the rule of thumb don't apply anymore'Cause the house is burningTrying to pull myself awayI'm caught in a pattern and I can't escapeTrying to pull myself awayLately when I get lost there's this thing I knowEven the dogs have somewhere to goEverything comes if you just let it beWork, work, brighten the corners that will never seeUntangle the thoughts that you know what they meanI hope that the answer didn't come too lateAnd the rule of thumb don't apply on me'Cause the tables are turningTrying to pull myself awayI'm caught in a pattern and I can't escapeTrying to pull myself awayI'm caught in a pattern and I can't escapeCan't escapeTrying to pull myself away, everything's goneTrying to pull myself away, everything's gone
