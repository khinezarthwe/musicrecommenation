Loose lips might sink ships but loose gooses take trips To San Francisco, double Dutch disco, Tech T V hottie, do it for Scotty Do it for the living and do it for the dead Do it for the monsters under your bed Do it for the teenagers and do it for your mom Broken hearts hurt but they make you strong and We won't stop until somebody calls the cops And even then we'll start again and just pretend that Nothing ever happened We won't stop until somebody calls the cops And even then we'll start again and just pretend that Nothing ever happened We're just dancing, we're just hugging, Singing, screaming, kissing, tugging On the sleeve of how it used to be How's it gonna be? I'll drop kick Russell Stover, move into the starting over house And know Matt Rouse and Jest are watching me achieve my dreams And we'll pray, all damn day, every day, That all this shit our President has got us in will go away While we strive to figure out a way we can survive These trying times without losing our minds So if you wanna burn yourself Remember that I love you And if you wanna cut yourself Remember that I love you And if you wanna kill yourself Remember that I love you Call me up before you're dead, we can make some plans instead Send me an I M, I'll be your friend Shysters live from scheme to scheme, but my 4th quarter pipe dreams Are seeming more and more worth fighting for So I'll curate some situations, make my job a big vacation And I'll say fuck Bush and fuck this war My war paint is Sharpie ink and I'll show you how much my shit stinks And ask you what you think because your thoughts and words are powerful They think we're disposable, well both my thumbs opposable Are spelled out on a double word and triple letter score We won't stop until somebody calls the cops And even then we'll start again and just pretend that Nothing ever happened We won't stop until somebody calls the cops And even then we'll start again and just pretend that Nothing ever happened We won't stop until somebody calls the cops And even then we'll start again and just pretend that Nothing ever happened We won't stop until somebody calls the cops And even then we'll start again and just pretend that Nothing ever happened We're just dancing, we're just hugging, Singing, screaming, kissing, tugging On the sleeve of how it used to be
