Baby Britain feels the bestFloating over a sea of vodkaSeparated from the restFights problems with bigger problemsSees the ocean fall and riseCounts the waves that somehow didn't hit herWater pouring from her eyesAlcoholic and very bitterFor someone half as smartYou'd be a work of artYou put yourself apartAnd I can't help until you startWe knocked another couple backThe dead soldiers lined up on the tableStill prepared for an attackThey didn't know they'd been disabledFelt a wave a rush of bloodYou won't be happy 'til the bottle's brokenAnd you're out swimming in the floodYou kept back, you kept unspokenFor someone half as smartYou'd be a work of artYou put yourself apartAnd I can't help you until you startYou got a look in your eyeWhen you're saying "goodbye"Like you wanna say "hi"The light was on but it was dim's been turned overAnd now it's ready once againThe radio was playing "Crimson and Clover"London bridge is safe and soundNo matter what you keep repeatingNothing's gonna drag me downTo a death that's not worth cheatingFor someone half as smartYou'd be a work of artYou put yourself apartAnd I can't help until you startFor someone half as smartYou'd be a work of artYou put yourself apart
