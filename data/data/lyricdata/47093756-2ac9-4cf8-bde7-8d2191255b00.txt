Well I have been searching all of my daysAll of my daysMany a road, you knowI've been walking onAll of my daysAnd I've been trying to findWhat's been in my mindAs the days keep turning into nightWell I have been quietly standing in the shadeAll of my daysWatch the sky breaking on the promise that we madeAll of this rainAnd I've been trying to findWhat's been in my mindAs the days keep turning into nightWell many a night I found myself with no friends standing nearAll of my daysI cried aloudI shook my handsWhat am I doing hereAll of these daysFor I look around meAnd my eyes confound meAnd it's just too brightAs the days keep turning into nightNow I see clearlyIt's you I'm looking forAll of my daysSoon I'll smileI know I'll feel this loneliness no moreAll of my daysFor I look around meAnd it seems you've found meAnd it's coming into sightAs the days keep turning into nightAs the days keep turning into nightAnd even breathing feels all rightYes, even breathing feels all rightNow even breathing feels all rightIt's even breathingFeels all right
