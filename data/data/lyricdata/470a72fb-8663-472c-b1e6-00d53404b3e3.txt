We are here to save your lifeThe fool, the drunk, the child, and his wifeWe won't let the sun go downWe gonna chase the demons out of townSinging when you feel aloneBackwards through the megaphoneSinging to the ones you loveAnd the ones you'd like to be rid of.We are here to take the blameTo take the taunts and if the shameWe are here to make you feelIt terrifies you, but its realIt will keep you up all nightAnd in the flood of morning lightSpilling out across your roomYou say the words will get there soonThe revolution wasn't badWe hit the streets with all we hadA tape recording of the soundOf the Velvet UndergroundA K-Way jacket torn to shredsAnd a dream inside our headsAnd after changing everythingThey couldn't tell we couldn't singAfter changing everythingThey couldn't tell we couldn't singThey couldn't tell we couldn't singAnd that changes everything.
