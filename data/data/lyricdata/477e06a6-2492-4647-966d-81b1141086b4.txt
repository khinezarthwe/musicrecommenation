I live in an apartment on the 99th floor of my blockAnd I sit at home looking out the window imagining the world has stoppedThen in flies a guy who's all dressed up just like a Union JackAnd says I've won five pounds if I have his kind of detergent packI said hey, you, get off of my cloudHey, you, get off of my cloudHey, you, get off of my cloudDon't hang around 'cause two's a crowd on my cloud, babyThe telephone is ringing I say, "Hi, it's me, who is it there on the line?"A voice says, "Hi, hello, how are you?" "Well, I guess I'm doin' fine"He says, "It's 3 AM, there's too much noise, don't you people ever wanna go to bed?Just 'cause you feel so good, do you have to drive me out of my head?"I said hey, you, get off of my cloudHey, you, get off of my cloudHey, you, get off of my cloudDon't hang around 'cause two's a crowd on my cloud, baby, yeahI was sick and tired, fed up with this and decided to take a drive downtownIt was so very quiet and peaceful, there was nobody, not a soul aroundI laid myself out, I was so tired and I started to dreamIn the mornin' the parkin' tickets were just like rags stuck on my window screenI said hey, you, get off of my cloudHey, you, get off of my cloudHey, you, get off of my cloudDon't hang around 'cause two's a crowd on my cloudHey, you, get off of my cloudHey, you, get off of my cloudHey, you, get off of my cloudDon't hang around 'cause two's a crowd on my cloud, baby
