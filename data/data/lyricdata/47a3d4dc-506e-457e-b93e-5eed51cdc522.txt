Oh the cold wet wind blew over the heatherYou wrote Charlie and Mary for foreverOn the back of a rockThat you picked up on the wayAnd in that perfect momentI nearly ruined itBy saying I love youAnd nearly meaning itBut you know I would never waste those wordsOh when I last saw MaryShe lied and said it was her birthdayOh when i last saw maryShe lied and said it was her birthdayBut then sheTried to kiss meAnd I said don't botherYou know we don't really love one anotherAnd there's no useIn burning out this flameOh but then things changed in a way I couldn't predictShe said I love you and it suddenly clickedThat she was only saying what she wanted me to hearAnd I saidPlease don't lie to me MaryAnd I saidPlease don't lie to me MaryI saidPlease don't lieOh it makes me cry in bedI saidPlease don't lieOh it makes me cry in bedI saidPlease don't lieOh it makes me cry in bedAnd she saidShut your mouthYou don't know what you're talking aboutOh she saidShut your mouthYou don't know what you're talking about
