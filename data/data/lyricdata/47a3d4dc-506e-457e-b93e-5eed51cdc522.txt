Oh the cold wet wind blew over the heather You wrote Charlie and Mary for forever On the back of a rock That you picked up on the way And in that perfect moment I nearly ruined it By saying I love you And nearly meaning it But you know I would never waste those words Oh when I last saw Mary She lied and said it was her birthday Oh when i last saw mary She lied and said it was her birthday But then she Tried to kiss me And I said don't bother You know we don't really love one another And there's no use In burning out this flame Oh but then things changed in a way I couldn't predict She said I love you and it suddenly clicked That she was only saying what she wanted me to hear And I said Please don't lie to me Mary And I said Please don't lie to me Mary I said Please don't lie Oh it makes me cry in bed I said Please don't lie Oh it makes me cry in bed I said Please don't lie Oh it makes me cry in bed And she said Shut your mouth You don't know what you're talking about Oh she said Shut your mouth You don't know what you're talking about
