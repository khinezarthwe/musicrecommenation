Someone lights a cigarette while riding in a car Some old guy takes a swig and passes back the jar But where they were last night, no one can remember Somebody got murdered -- goodbye, for keeps, forever Somebody got murdered Somebody's dead forever And you're minding your own business, carrying spare change You wouldn't cosh a barber, you're hungry all the same I've been very tempted to grab it from the till I've been very hungry, but not enough to kill Somebody got murdered Somebody's dead forever Somebody got murdered, his name cannot be found A small stain on the pavement, they'll scrub it off the ground As the daily crowd disperses, no one says that much Somebody got murdered and it left me with a touch Somebody got murdered Somebody's dead forever Sounds like murder Those shouts Are they drunk down below? Sounds like murder Those screams Are they drunk down below? It's late, and my watch stopped Some time ago Sounds like murder Those screams Are they drunk down below?
