Day after day, love turns greyLike the skin of a dying manAnd night after night, we pretend it's all rightBut I have grown older andYou have grown colder andNothing is very much fun anymoreAnd I can feel one of my turns coming onI feel, cold as a razor bladeTight as a tourniquetDry as a funeral drumRun to the bedroom, in the suitcase on the leftYou'll find my favorite axeDon't look so frightenedThis is just a passing phaseOne of my bad daysWould you like to watch T.V.?Or get between the sheets?Or contemplate the silent freeway?Would you like something to eat?Would you like to learn to fly? Would you?Would you like to see me try? Ooh noWould you like to call the cops?Do you think it's time I stopped?Why are you running away?
