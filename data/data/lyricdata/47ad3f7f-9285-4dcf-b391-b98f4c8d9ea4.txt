Well they were given the grapes that go ripe in the sunThat loosen the screws at the back of the tongueBut they told no one where they had begunFour horsemenThey were given all the foods of vanityAnd all the instant promises of immortalityBut they bit the dust screaming insanityFour horsemenOne was over the edge, one was over the cliffOne was licking 'em dry with a bloody great spliffWhen they picked up the hiker he didn't want the liftFrom the horsemenBut you, you're not searching, are you now?You're not looking anyhowYou're never gonna ride that lonely mileOr put yourself up on trialOh, you told me how your life was so badAnd I agree that it does seem sadBut that's the price that you gotta payIf you're lazing all around all dayFour horsemen and they're coming right throughFour horsemen and they're pissing by youThey make you look like you're wearing a trussFour horsemen and it's gonna be usWell they gave us everything for bending the mindAnd we cleaned out their pockets and we drank 'em blindIt's a long way to the finish so don't get left behindBy those horsemenAnd they gave us the grapes that went ripe in the sunThat loosen the screws at the back of the tongueBut we still told nothing about what was to comeFour horsemen
