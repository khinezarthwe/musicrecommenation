Oh my, Oh myWhat a wretched lifeI was born on the dayThat my poor momma diedI was cut from her bellyWith a stanley knifeMy daddy did a jigWith the drunk midwifeWho's that yonder all in flamesDragging behind him a sack of chainsWho's that yonder all in flamesUp jumped the Devil and he staked his claimO poor heartI was doomed from the startDoomed to playThe villians partI was the baddest JohnnyIn the apple cartMy blood was blackerThan the chambers of a dead nun's heartWho's that milling on the courthouse stepsNailing my face to the hitching fenceWho's that milling on the courthouse stepsUp jumped the Devil and off he creptOh no, Oh noWhere could I goWith my hump of troubleAnd my sack of woeTo the digs and deserts of MexicoWhere my neck was safer from the lynching ropeWho's that yonder laughing at meLike I was the brunt of some hilarityWho's that yonder laughing at meUp jumped the Devil 1, 2, 3Ha-Ha Ha HaHow lucky we wereWe hit the cathousesAnd sampled their watersWe got as drunkAs a couple of CzarsOne night I swallowedMy lucky starWho's that dancing on the jailhouse roofStamping on the ramping with a cloven hoofWho's that dancing on the jailhouse roofUp jumped the Devil and said "Here's your man, I got proof!"Oh no, Oh no don't goOh slow down JoeThe righteous pathIs straight as an arrowTake a walkAnd you'll find it's too narrowToo narrow for the likes of meWho's that hanging from the gallow treeHis eyes are plucked but he looks like meWho's that swinging from the gallow treeUp jumped the Devil and he took my soul from meDown we go Down we go Down we goThe Devil and me Down we go down down downHell fire and flames Down we go Down we goTo Eternity Down we go We go down down downDown we go we go down down downDown we go the Devil and me to EternityWe go down down down down down ad inferno
