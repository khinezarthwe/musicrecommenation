Oh my, Oh my What a wretched life I was born on the day That my poor momma died I was cut from her belly With a stanley knife My daddy did a jig With the drunk midwife Who's that yonder all in flames Dragging behind him a sack of chains Who's that yonder all in flames Up jumped the Devil and he staked his claim O poor heart I was doomed from the start Doomed to play The villians part I was the baddest Johnny In the apple cart My blood was blacker Than the chambers of a dead nun's heart Who's that milling on the courthouse steps Nailing my face to the hitching fence Who's that milling on the courthouse steps Up jumped the Devil and off he crept Oh no, Oh no Where could I go With my hump of trouble And my sack of woe To the digs and deserts of Mexico Where my neck was safer from the lynching rope Who's that yonder laughing at me Like I was the brunt of some hilarity Who's that yonder laughing at me Up jumped the Devil 1, 2, 3 Ha- Ha Ha Ha How lucky we were We hit the cathouses And sampled their waters We got as drunk As a couple of Czars One night I swallowed My lucky star Who's that dancing on the jailhouse roof Stamping on the ramping with a cloven hoof Who's that dancing on the jailhouse roof Up jumped the Devil and said " Here's your man, I got proof!" Oh no, Oh no don't go Oh slow down Joe The righteous path Is straight as an arrow Take a walk And you'll find it's too narrow Too narrow for the likes of me Who's that hanging from the gallow tree His eyes are plucked but he looks like me Who's that swinging from the gallow tree Up jumped the Devil and he took my soul from me Down we go Down we go Down we go The Devil and me Down we go down down down Hell fire and flames Down we go Down we go To Eternity Down we go We go down down down Down we go we go down down down Down we go the Devil and me to Eternity We go down down down down down ad inferno
