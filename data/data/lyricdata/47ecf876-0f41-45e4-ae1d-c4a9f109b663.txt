"" I pray for all our souls In this time of mind control I shout at the heavens above I saw anger where there once was love We were born in an age of aggression Where the bear and the eagle stood face to face When the walls started to crumble Why did human terror spring up in its place? My god have I become Designated as the chosen one I'm born from a different place Got this way from a state of grace Crying Dying Caring Denying Worshiped Pained Crucified, degraded Hated Baited Desperate and jaded Brainwashed Desperate Ultimately betrayed I am just a pawn in this game Betrayed by my own leaders A blessed part of the game The only disobedient I am just a pawn in this game Betrayed by my own leaders No blessed part of the game The only disobedient My god have I become Designated as the chosen one I fall from a different place Got this way from a state of grace Father! Why am I going to hell? For crying Dying Killing Denying Worshipped Hated Crucified, degraded Why am I going to hell? Crucified, degraded Why am I going to hell?
