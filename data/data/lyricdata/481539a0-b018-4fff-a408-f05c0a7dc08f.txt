We've been to the top, we've been to the bottomWe've known everything and forgotten, yeahYou've kicked me around, you've wrapped me in cottonYou've carried our load, and you've shot 'emOh yes the butterflies are still thereOh yes the butterflies are still thereWe've argued by the baggage claimWe've accepted and we've laid blameWe've drank Sangthip in monsoonal rainWe've felt separate and felt the sameOh yes the butterflies are still thereOh yes the butterflies are still thereOh yes the butterflies are still thereOh yes the butterflies are still thereWe've shared joy and we've shared painWe've shared guilt and we've shared shameWe've bought into the stupid gamesWe've freed each other and we laid claimOh yes the butterflies are still thereOh yes the butterflies are still thereOh yes the butterflies are still thereOh yes the butterflies are still thereBecause we came from the same cocoon
