By the light of the LED display of a VCR recorderYou kiss my neck, I whisper in your ear, "this is my downfall"As you squint and you grimace, we both know your heart's not in itBy the glow of a thousand fireflies in a travelodge en-suite:They think the future's bright as halogen, we know it's pretty bleakAnd I'm trying to be sexy, biting at the air that falls in front of me.Your telegrams are more and more less detailed by the dayAnd all the characters are strangers and the pubs have different namesI tell a joke that I'd like to meet them but they loathe me and I hate them backAbsence makes the heart grow fonderFondness makes the absence longerLength loses my interest, I'm a realist, I'm insatiableSwapped counting days until I fly, with hours before your replyYou said he got his teeth fixedI'm gonna break themI've got a heart on fireHe said he's got his sights setOn getting to youI've got a fist on fireYou feel terrified at the thought of being left behindOf losing everybody, the necessity of dyingOh, WE KID OURSELVES THERE'S FUTURE IN THE FUCKING,BUT THERE IS NO FUCKING FUTUREI'm just practising my accents, picking at old suturesI taught myself the only way to vaguely get along in loveIs to like the other slightly less than you get in returnI keep feeling like I'm being undercutCharlotte says, "It's more constructive than the one in Canada,When you got drunk,Ate loads of crispsAnd threw up by a football pitch"I know it is,And really that's what worries me,I feel like I shouldHurt.I cannot emphasise enough that my bodyIs a badly designed, poorly put together vessel,Harbouring these diminishing, so-called 'vital organs'Hope my heart goes first,I HOPE MY HEART GOES FIRST!AndWe are beautiful,We are doomed.
