By the light of the L E D display of a V C R recorder You kiss my neck, I whisper in your ear, "this is my downfall" As you squint and you grimace, we both know your heart's not in it By the glow of a thousand fireflies in a travelodge en-suite: They think the future's bright as halogen, we know it's pretty bleak And I'm trying to be sexy, biting at the air that falls in front of me. Your telegrams are more and more less detailed by the day And all the characters are strangers and the pubs have different names I tell a joke that I'd like to meet them but they loathe me and I hate them back Absence makes the heart grow fonder Fondness makes the absence longer Length loses my interest, I'm a realist, I'm insatiable Swapped counting days until I fly, with hours before your reply You said he got his teeth fixed I'm gonna break them I've got a heart on fire He said he's got his sights set On getting to you I've got a fist on fire You feel terrified at the thought of being left behind Of losing everybody, the necessity of dying Oh, W E K I D O U R S E L V E S T H E R E' S F U T U R E I N T H E F U C K I N G, B U T T H E R E I S N O F U C K I N G F U T U R E I'm just practising my accents, picking at old sutures I taught myself the only way to vaguely get along in love Is to like the other slightly less than you get in return I keep feeling like I'm being undercut Charlotte says, " It's more constructive than the one in Canada, When you got drunk, Ate loads of crisps And threw up by a football pitch" I know it is, And really that's what worries me, I feel like I should Hurt. I cannot emphasise enough that my body Is a badly designed, poorly put together vessel, Harbouring these diminishing, so-called 'vital organs' Hope my heart goes first, I H O P E M Y H E A R T G O E S F I R S T! And We are beautiful, We are doomed.
