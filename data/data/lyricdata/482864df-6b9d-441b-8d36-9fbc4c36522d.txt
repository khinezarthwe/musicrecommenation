You and I we may look the sameBut we are very far apartThere's bullet holes where my compassion used to beAnd there is violence in my heartInto fire you can send usFrom the fire we returnYou can label us a consequenceOf how much you have to learnYou can try but you'll never understandThis is something you will never understandCan you hear it now?Hear it coming now?Can you hear it now?On hands and kneesWe crawlYou can not stop us allYou wear our bonesOur skinWe will not let you inYou have set something in motionMuch greater than you've ever knownStanding there in all your grand naivet√©About to reap what you have sownTime will feed upon your weaknessesAnd soon you'll lose the will to careWhen you return to the place that you call homeWe will be thereWe will be thereOn hands and kneesWe crawlYou can not stop us allOur bloodWill stayWe will not go awayOn hands and kneesWe crawlYou can not stop us allOur bloodOur graceWill never leave this place
