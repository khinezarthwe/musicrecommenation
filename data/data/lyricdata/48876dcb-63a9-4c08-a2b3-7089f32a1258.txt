It started with a low lightNext thing I knew they ripped me from my bedAnd then they took my blood typeThey left a strange impression in my headYou know that I was hopingThat I could leave this star-crossed world behindBut when they cut me openI guess I changed my mindAnd you know I might have just flownToo far from the floor this time'Cause they're calling me by my nameAnd they're zipping white light beamsDisregarding bombs and satellitesAnd that was the turning pointThat was one lonely nightThe star maker says it ain't so badThe dream maker's gonna make you madThe spaceman says, "Everybody look down.It's all in your mind."Well, now I'm back at home andI'm looking forward to this life I liveYou know it's gonna haunt meSome hesitation to this life I giveYou think you might cross overYou're caught between the devil and the deep blue seaYou better look it overBefore you make that leapAnd you know I'm fineBut I hear those voices at nightSometimes they justify my claimAnd the public don't dwell on my transmission'Cause it wasn't televisedBut it was a turning pointOh, what a lonely nightThe star maker says it ain't so badThe dream maker's gonna make you madThe spaceman says, "Everybody look down.It's all in your mind."The star maker says it ain't so badThe dream maker's gonna make you madThe spaceman says, "Everybody look down.It's all in your mind."My global position systems are vocally addressedThey say the Nile used to run from east to westThey say the Nile used to run from east to westI'm fineBut I hear those voices at night sometimesThe star maker says it ain't so badThe dream maker's gonna make you madThe spaceman says, "Everybody look down.It's all in your mind."The star maker says it ain't so badThe dream maker's gonna make you madThe spaceman says, "Everybody look down.It's all in your mind."It's all in my mindIt's all in my mind
