Virginia death threatVirginia creeper vineThe hands that feed intentChoke the purpose of this timeTake all that you can giveAnd I will make it mineNo care for what you've spentEven fool's gold has its shineNever held down, never restrainedVirtue's foot to the throatFree of broken chainsThus always to tyrantsLaugh at the conqueredThe victims now betrayAnd in this CommonwealthThere's merely a common concern for selfWe hold these lies to be self-evident,As the dividends will reflectAnd in this CommonwealthThere's merely a common concern for selfThe coffers have long run dryNever held down, never restrainedVirtue's foot to the throatFree of broken chainsThus always to tyrantsLaugh at the conqueredThe victims now betrayLike a bull in a China shop,But the shelves have all been clearedA thief in an empty vaultThe sheep already shearedLike a bull in a China shop,But the shelves have all been clearedA thief in an empty vaultThe sheep already shearedA screen door on a submarineAn eagle with a broken wingHope in a dead man's dreamThe sound of a bellThat will never ringYou're just wasting timeYou're just wasting timeYou're wasting time
