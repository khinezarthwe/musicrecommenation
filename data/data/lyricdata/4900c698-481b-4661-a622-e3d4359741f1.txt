You hit me once, I hit you back You gave a kick, I gave a slap You smashed a plate over my head Then I set fire to our bed You hit me once, I hit you back You gave a kick, I gave a slap You smashed a plate over my head Then I set fire to our bed, whoa My black eye casts no shadow Your red eye sees no blame Your slaps don't stick, your kicks don't hit So we remain the same Blood sticks, sweat drips Break the lock if it don't fit A kick in the teeth is good for some A kiss with a fist is better than none Whoa, a kiss with a fist is better than none I broke your jaw once before I spilled your blood upon the floor You broke my leg in return So I sit back and watch the bed burn Well love sticks, sweat drips Break the lock if it don't fit A kick in the teeth is good for some A kiss with a fist is better than none Whoa, a kiss with a fist is better than none You hit me once, I hit you back You gave a kick, I gave a slap You smashed a plate over my head Then I set fire to our bed, whoa Whoa, you hit me once, I hit you back You gave a kick, I gave a slap You smashed a plate over my head Then I set fire to our bed
