Cut this picture into you and meBurn it backwards, kill this historyMake it over, make it stay awayOr hate'll sing the ending that love started to sayThere's a kid a floor below me saying, "Brother, can you spareSunshine for a brother? Old man winter's in the air"Walked me up a story, asking how you areTold me not to worry, "you were just a shooting star"Sweet AdelineSweet AdelineMy ClementineSweet Adeline(Oh)It's a picture perfect evening and I'm staring down the sunFully loaded, deaf and dumb and doneWaiting for sedation to disconnect my headOr any situation where I'm better off than dead
