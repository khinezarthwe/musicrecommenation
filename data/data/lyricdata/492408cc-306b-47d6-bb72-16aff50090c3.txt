Up and downâ€¦ Here in my mind There's no disguising you I start to begin Beside of you I'm calling I'm calling You get serious When you talk about Things you know you know about A loyal friend with a grip On a world that can slip from under you We disappear, reappear and you still make Sense to me, that recipe Write things down, how they sound and the ground Can open up, and comfort us My old friend What a friend of mine Tying knots on a string of time Haul me up when the time has come Skipping rope, when we're having fun Up and Up and down Up and Up and down Up and Up and down Up and Up and down Sing when you talk I'll listen Sing when you think I'm near Can't be a song without you Harmonise, sing your memory here Up and down Up and down Up and down Up and down You get emotional When you talk about Lucy, Jo or family A loyal love is a gift in a world that can shift From under you We're not around, then around and the games Will get more fun as we like to win And win we do, with your love, with the crew Adoring your move, to three from just two My old friend What a friend of mine Tying knots on a string of time Haul me up when the time has come Skipping rope, when we're having fun Up and Up and down Up and Up and down Up and Up and down Up and Up and down Sing when you talk I'll listen Sing when you think I'm near Can't be a song without you Harmonise, sing your memory here( This refrain) Sing when you talk( We are calling) I'll listen( This refrain) Sing when you think I'm near( We are calling) Can't be a song without you( This refrain) Harmonise, sing your memory here( We are calling this refrain) We are calling this refrain Always have a day in a month to be yours now This refrain Always have a month in a year to be yours now This refrain Always have a ground for an ear to be yours now This refrain Always have ways to your house in my head now You are the world I am your people You are the world I am your people You are the world I am your people You are the world I am your people( This refrain) You are the world( We are calling this refrain) I am your people( This refrain) You are the world( We are calling this refrain) I am your people( We are calling this refrain) Sing when you talk I'll listen Can't be a song without you Harmonise
