Came the nightA mist dissolved the treesAnd in the broken lightColours flyFading byPale and coldAs figures fill the gladeGrey is the web they spinOn and onAnd on and onThrough the flameStill summer lingers onThough her pictures soon shatterAllAlways the sameBut there appears inThe shades of dawning,Though your eyes are dimAll of the pieces in the skyThere was onceA harvest in this landReap from the turquoise skyHarlequinHarlequinDancing roundThree children fill the gladeTheirs was the laughter inThe winding streamAnd in betweenClose your doorThe picture fades againFrom the flames in the firelightAllAlways the sameBut there appears inThe shades of dawningThough your eyes are dimAll of the pieces in the skyAllAll is not lostAnd light appears inThe shades of dawningWhen your eyes can seeOrder the piecesPut them backPut them back
