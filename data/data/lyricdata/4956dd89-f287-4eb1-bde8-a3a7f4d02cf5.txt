I think you knowBecause it's old newsThe people you love are hard to findSo I think if I were in your shoesI would be kindI look out for youCome rain come shineWhat good does it do?I guess I'm a toy that is brokenI guess we're just older nowI want to stay another seasonSee summer upon this sorry landSo don't dust off your gunWithout a reason you understandI look out for youCome rain come shineWhat good does it do?I guess I'm a toy that is brokenI guess we're just older nowWho says a river can't leave its waters?Who says you walk in a line?Who says a city can't change its borders?Who says you're mine?I look out for youCome rain come shineWhat good does it do?I guess I'm a record you're tired ofI guess we're just older nowI guess I'm a toy that is brokenI guess we're just older now
