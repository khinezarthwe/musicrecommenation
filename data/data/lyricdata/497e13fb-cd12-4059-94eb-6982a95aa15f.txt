Confusion in her eyes that says it all, she's lost controlAnd she's clinging to the nearest passerby, she's lost controlAnd she gave away the secrets of her past and said, "I've lost control again"And of a voice that told her when and where to act she said, "I've lost control again"And she turned around and took me by the hand and said, "I've lost control again"And how I'll never know just why or understand she said, "I've lost control again"And she screamed out, kicking on her side and said, "I've lost control again"And seized up on the floor, I thought she'd die, she said, "I've lost control"She's lost control againShe's lost controlShe's lost control againShe's lost controlWell, I had to phone her friend to state my case and say she's lost control againAnd she showed up all the errors and mistakes and said, "I've lost control again"And she expressed herself in many different ways until she lost control againAnd walked upon the edge of no escape and laughed, "I've lost control"She's lost control againShe's lost controlShe's lost control againShe's lost control
