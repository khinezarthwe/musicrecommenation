Here now, don't make a soundSay, have you heard the news today?One flag was taken downTo raise another in its placeA heavy cross you bearA stubborn heart remains unchangedNo harm, no life, no loveNo stranger singin' in your nameBut maybe the seasonThe colors change in the valley skiesDear God, I've sealed my fateRunnin' through hell, heaven can waitLong road to ruin there in your eyesUnder the cold streetlightsNo tomorrow, no dead end in sightLet's say we take this townNo king or queen of any stateGet up to shut it downOpen the streets and raise the gatesI know a wall to scaleI know a field without a nameHead on without a careBefore it's way too lateMaybe the seasonThe colors change in the valley skiesOh God, I've sealed my fateRunnin' through hell, heaven can waitLong road to ruin there in your eyesUnder the cold streetlightsNo tomorrow, no dead endsLong road to ruin there in your eyesUnder the cold streetlightsNo tomorrow, no dead end in sightFor every piece to fall in placeForever gone without a traceYour horizon takes its shapeNo turnin' back, don't turn that pageCome now, I'm leavin' here tonightCome now, let's leave it all behindIs that the price you pay?Runnin' through hell, heaven can waitLong road to ruin there in your eyesUnder the cold streetlightsNo tomorrow, no dead endsLong road to ruin there in your eyesUnder the cold streetlightsNo tomorrow, no dead endsLong road to ruin there in your eyesUnder the cold streetlightsNo tomorrow, no dead end in sight
