I'm in a golden age A great calendar page But I spotted the right time The future is mine I got the greatest daughter The best of them all I love my brother He's on my wall Bye bye car keys Hello sparkles and flies I keep them They're mine I saw the brightest light It was the most wonderful sight And I spotted the right time The future is mine Bye bye car keys Hello sparkles and flies I keep them They're mine Bye bye car keys Hello sparkles and flies I keep them They're mine The sparkles and flies I keep them They're mine
