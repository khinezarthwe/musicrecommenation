I'm in a golden ageA great calendar pageBut I spotted the right timeThe future is mineI got the greatest daughterThe best of them allI love my brotherHe's on my wallBye bye car keysHello sparkles and fliesI keep themThey're mineI saw the brightest lightIt was the most wonderful sightAnd I spotted the right timeThe future is mineBye bye car keysHello sparkles and fliesI keep themThey're mineBye bye car keysHello sparkles and fliesI keep themThey're mineThe sparkles and fliesI keep themThey're mine
