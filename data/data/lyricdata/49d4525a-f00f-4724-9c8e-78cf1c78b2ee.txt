There's a bottomless pit that we've been climbing fromJust to get on level groundShake your seasick legs aroundEveryone in a logo townSigns of life are stark and flickeringI need a bed to lay my body downDead weight to carry me downSome static is lulling me to sleepHang your clothes on a chain link fenceIn a junkyard say amenYour mouth is full of wordless hymnsAnd run-on sentencesAnd we're helpless and forgetting in the background holding nothingAnd we're youthless and pretending in the bearhands holding nothingThere's a million horse dragging down a monoliththese trademarks so bereavedTied my leg to a barricadewith a plastic handgrenadeThey tried to turn emotion into noiseI need a teleprompter for my lifeNeed a pipeline to the nightMy body can't get no reliefAnd this life it goes by fastTo treading water in the pastWhile you try to reanimate something that you don't understandAnd we're helpless and forgetting in the background don't saying nothingAnd he's youthless and forgetting in the bare hymns tied to nothingAnd he's helpless and forgetting in the background don't saying nothingAnd he's youthless and pretending with his bare hands tied to nothing
