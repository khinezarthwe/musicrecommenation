Look up at the heavens aboveI know there's so much moreBlinded by man-made lightThe stars above were there beforeMy father took me by the handAnd showed me the wonders of the skyWe explored the depths of outer spaceTime travel with the naked eyeWe destroyed the earthSold her out for gold and oilWe erased the stars in heavenAllowed our once dark sky to spoilA synthetic amber glow of ignoranceCancels out my beloved starsI once saw constellations infiniteNow my space bares human scarsI can't see the light that hides in the darkI am blinded by light that destroys the nightTurn the night in to day I can't see heaven this wayI want my children to see what I sawWhat I sawWhat I now can't see
