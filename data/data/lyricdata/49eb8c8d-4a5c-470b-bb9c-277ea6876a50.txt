Look up at the heavens above I know there's so much more Blinded by man-made light The stars above were there before My father took me by the hand And showed me the wonders of the sky We explored the depths of outer space Time travel with the naked eye We destroyed the earth Sold her out for gold and oil We erased the stars in heaven Allowed our once dark sky to spoil A synthetic amber glow of ignorance Cancels out my beloved stars I once saw constellations infinite Now my space bares human scars I can't see the light that hides in the dark I am blinded by light that destroys the night Turn the night in to day I can't see heaven this way I want my children to see what I saw What I saw What I now can't see
