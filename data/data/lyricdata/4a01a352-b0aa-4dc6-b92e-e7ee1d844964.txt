Nothing's ever changed, you still turn awayYou've washed your hands, you've made that all too clearYou just keep on living this lieYou refuse to see, you're denying meThe cross I bear but you don't seem to careEven Judas knew he had liedI keep wondering whyI'm still calling your name through my tearsWhy have you waited to embrace me my dear?Cold is your silence, denying what is realI'm still wondering whyI'm still calling your name my dearI'm sorry if you can't stand the naked truthAll you see is how you want it to beSo you keep on living your lifeRelease me from this cross after all these yearsOh call my name and help me with this weightEven though it comes far too lateI keep wondering whyI'm still calling your name through my tearsWhy have you waited to embrace me my dearCold is your silence, denying what is realI'm still wondering why I'm still calling your nameAnd I wonder, oh I wonder ...In my heart I still hope you will open the doorYou can purify it all, answer my callWhy? Why?Why have you waited to embrace me my dear?Cold is your silence, denying what is realI'm still wondering why I'm still calling your nameAnd I wonder, oh I wonder ...In my heart I still hope you will open the doorYou can purify it all, answer my call
