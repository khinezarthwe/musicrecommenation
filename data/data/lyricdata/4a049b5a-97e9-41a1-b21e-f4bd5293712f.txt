Can you feel a little love?As your bony fingers close around meLong and spindly Death becomes meHeaven, can you see what I see?Hey, you pale and sickly childYou're death and living reconciledBeen walking home a crooked milePaying debt to karmaYou party for a livingWhat you take won't kill youBut careful what you're givingThere's no time for hesitatingPain is ready, pain is waitingPrimed to do its educatingUnwanted, uninvited kinIt creeps beneath your crawling skinIt lives without, it lives within youFeel the fever comingYou're shaking and twitchingYou can scratch all overBut that won't stop you itchingCan you feel a little love?Can you feel a little love?Dream on, dream onBlame it on your karmic curseOh, shame upon the universeIt knows its lines, it's well rehearsedIt sucked you in, it dragged you downTo where there is no hallowed groundWhere holiness is never foundPaying debt to karmaYou party for a livingWhat you take won't kill youBut careful what you're givingCan you feel a little love?Can you feel a little love?Dream on, dream on
