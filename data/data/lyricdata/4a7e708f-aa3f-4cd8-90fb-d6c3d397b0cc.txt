Don't hold yourself like thatYou'll hurt your kneesI kissed your mouth and backBut that's all I needDon't build your world around volcanoes melt you downWhat I am to you is not realWhat I am to you you do not needWhat I am to you is not what you mean to meYou give me miles and miles of mountainsAnd I'll ask for the seaDon't throw yourself like thatIn front of meI kissed your mouth your backIs that all you need?Don't drag my love around volcanoes melt me downWhat I am to you is not realWhat I am to you you do not needWhat I am to you is not what you mean to meYou give me miles and miles of mountainsAnd I'll ask for what I give to youIs just what I'm going throughThis is nothing newNo no just another phase of finding what I really needIs what makes me bleedAnd like a new disease she's still too young to treatVolcanoes melt me downShe's still too youngI kissed your mouthYou do not need me
