I knew a girlHer name was truthShe was a horrible liar.She couldnt spend one day longBut she couldnt be satisfiedWhen you have everything,You have everything to lose.She made herselfA bed of nailsAnd shes plannin' on puttin' it to use.Cos she had diamonds on the insideShe had diamonds on the insideShe had diamonds on the insideDiamondsA candle throws its light into the darknessIn a nasty world,so shines the good deedMake sure the fortune, that you seekIs the fortune that you need.So tell me why,the first to ask,is the last to give,everytimeWhat you say and do not meanFollow too close behindCos she had diamonds on the insideShe had diamonds on the insideShe wore diamonds on the insideDiamondsLike a soldier standing long under fireAny change comes as a relief.Let the giver's name remain unspokenFor she is just a generous thief.But she had diamonds on the insideCos she had diamonds on the insideShe wore diamonds on the insideShe wore diamondsOh diamondsShe had diamondsShe wore diamondsDiamonds
