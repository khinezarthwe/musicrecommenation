One last kiss, one only, then I let you goHard for you, I've fallen, but you can't break my fallI'm broken, don't break me, when I hit the groundSome devil, some angel has got me to the bonesYou said, always and foreverNow I believe you babyYou said, always and forever, is such a long and lonely timeToo drunk 'n still drinkingIt's just the way I feelIt's alright, is what you told meCuz what we had was so beautifulBut I feel heavy, like floating, at the bottom of the seaYou said, always and foreverNow I believe you babyYou said, always and forever, is such a long, lonely timeSome devil is stuck inside meWhy can't I set it freeI wish I was dead, and you're breathingJust so that you could knowSome angel is stuck inside meWhy can't I set you freeYou said always and foreverNow I believe you babyYou said always and forever, such a long, lonely timeStuck inside of me
