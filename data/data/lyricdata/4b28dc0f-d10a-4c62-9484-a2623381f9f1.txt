Don't be afraid if you hear voicesOr feel the sweet air spoken upon youSometimes the sound of a thousand whispering words of hope will reassureShow me the futureWe'll see us joined togetherIf the oceans fled or the mountains sighThen I will keep on dreamingI live to dream againI live to dream againI live to dream againDon't be afraid if you're descending the deepest despair without a handrail to guide youSometimes the sound of a thousand whispering words can confuseBut when you're sleepingThey shift and slide togetherBring meaning to the canyon's cryOh I, I keep on dreamingI live to dream againI live to dream againI live to dream againI live to dream againSometimes the sound of a thousand whispers are where you live a little fear,but feel the futureWell I feel us dream togetherI'll feel no fear, I'll feel no fireOh I, I keep on dreamingI live to dream againI live to dream againI live to dream againI live to dream againI live to dream againI live to dream againI live to dream
