Waking up today, it was cold out There's something I should say, but I can't get my head around The bends in your brain, and your elaborate pain Makes me tired As an old balloon, I hold my breath Like a penance paid too soon, and with too much eagerness To know what is true When air is changed by you Makes it hard I don't know where it comes from Where to go When the rains come When the rain put me back In the bottle Where the sea meets the sun Where the bones and their rattle They don't mean anything to no one I, I had a swing When my salt was my own I'd my teeth bared for battle Till love lost made me dull It made me dull It made me dull Put me back in the bottle Where the sea meets the sun Where the bones and their rattle They don't mean anything to no one And I had a swing When my salt was my own I'd my teeth bared for battle Till love lost made me dull It made me dull It made me dull
