Waking up today, it was cold outThere's something I should say, but I can't get my head aroundThe bends in your brain, and your elaborate painMakes me tiredAs an old balloon, I hold my breathLike a penance paid too soon, and with too much eagernessTo know what is trueWhen air is changed by youMakes it hardI don't know where it comes fromWhere to goWhen the rains comeWhen the rain put me backIn the bottleWhere the sea meets the sunWhere the bones and their rattleThey don't mean anything to no oneI, I had a swingWhen my salt was my ownI'd my teeth bared for battleTill love lost made me dullIt made me dullIt made me dullPut me back in the bottleWhere the sea meets the sunWhere the bones and their rattleThey don't mean anything to no oneAnd I had a swingWhen my salt was my ownI'd my teeth bared for battleTill love lost made me dullIt made me dullIt made me dull
