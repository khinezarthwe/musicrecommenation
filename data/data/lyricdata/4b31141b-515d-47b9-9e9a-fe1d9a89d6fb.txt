And a fall from youis a long way downI've found a better way outAnd a fall from hereis a long way downI know a better way outWell it's been a long timesince I've seen you smileGambled away my frightTill the morning lights shineIt's been a long timesince I've seen you smileGambled away my frightTill the morning lights shineSunday morningonly fog on the limbsI called it againwhat do you knowAnd I filled our dayswith cards and ginYou're alight again, my dearI will lead the way,Oh, lead the way when I knowAnd I'll sleep away,I'll sweep away what I don'tWell seize the way,Oh, seize the way, no, I won'tI will lead the way,Oh, lead the day when I know
