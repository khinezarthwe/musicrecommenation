And a fall from youis a long way down I've found a better way out And a fall from hereis a long way down I know a better way out Well it's been a long timesince I've seen you smile Gambled away my fright Till the morning lights shine It's been a long timesince I've seen you smile Gambled away my fright Till the morning lights shine Sunday morningonly fog on the limbs I called it againwhat do you know And I filled our dayswith cards and gin You're alight again, my dear I will lead the way, Oh, lead the way when I know And I'll sleep away, I'll sweep away what I don't Well seize the way, Oh, seize the way, no, I won't I will lead the way, Oh, lead the day when I know
