I couldn't resist him, his eyes were like yoursHis hair was exactly the shade of brownHe's just not as tall, but I couldn't tellIt was dark and I was lying downYou are everything, he means nothing to meI can't even remember his nameWhy're you so upset?Baby, you weren't there and I was thinking of you when I cameWhat do you expect? You left me here aloneI drank so much and needed to touchDon't overreact, I pretended he was youYou wouldn't want me to be lonelyHow can I put it so you understand?I didn't let him hold my handBut he looked like youI guess he looked like youNo, he wasn't youBut you can still trust me, this ain't infidelityIt's not cheating, you were on my mindYes, he looked like youBut I heard love is blind
