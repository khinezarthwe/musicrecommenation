When you are ready I will surrender take me and do as you wishHave what you want your way's always the best wayI have succumbed to this passive sensation peacefully falling awayI am a zombie your wish will command me, laugh as I fall to my kneesCan I control this empty delusion lost in the fire below?And you come running your eyes will be openAnd when you come back I'll be as you want me, only so eager to pleaseMy little song will keep you beside me thinking your name as I singSing it back to meSing it back to meNow you can't help it if you have been tempted by fruit hanging ripe on the treeAnd I feel useless don't care what the truth is you will be here come the dayTruth do you hear me? Don't try to come near me. So tired, I sleep through the lightIf you desire to lay here beside me come to my sweet melodySing it back to meBring it back, sing it backBring it back, sing it back to meBring it back, sing it backBring it back, sing it back to meSing it, sing itSing it back to meBring it back, sing it backBring it back, sing it back to meBring it back, sing it backBring it back, sing it back to me
