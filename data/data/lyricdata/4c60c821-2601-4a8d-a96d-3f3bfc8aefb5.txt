Here's my genius planTo make a superior manYou're anatomically builtThis half corpse can't guiltInfected by your innocent heartBlue blood, tear apartShattered glass makes shattered ribsNow my head will start to giveI was your father, wincing at meYou're my deacon, perfect loveDoctor Death Mary BethNow I have a hearse to getSolid screams, sleep machinesI'll be loved drowning in keroseneWhat the fuck is thisOh, it's the bassWhen you can't sleep, you think of meI'm not yours, but follow meAnesthetic, may your paceMutilate the human raceThis way we could be togetherLike a corpse stitched with leatherOn this planet for so longThe silence screams my favorite song
