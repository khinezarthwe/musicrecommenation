Here's my genius plan To make a superior man You're anatomically built This half corpse can't guilt Infected by your innocent heart Blue blood, tear apart Shattered glass makes shattered ribs Now my head will start to give I was your father, wincing at me You're my deacon, perfect love Doctor Death Mary Beth Now I have a hearse to get Solid screams, sleep machines I'll be loved drowning in kerosene What the fuck is this Oh, it's the bass When you can't sleep, you think of me I'm not yours, but follow me Anesthetic, may your pace Mutilate the human race This way we could be together Like a corpse stitched with leather On this planet for so long The silence screams my favorite song
