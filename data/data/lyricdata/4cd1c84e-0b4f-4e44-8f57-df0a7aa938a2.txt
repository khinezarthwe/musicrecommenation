My moon, my manSo changeable andSuch a loveable lamb to meMy care, my coatLeave on a high noteThere's nowhere to go but onHeart on my sleeveNot where it should beThe song's out of key againMy moon's white faceWhat day and what phaseIt's the calendar page againTake it slowTake it easy on meAnd shed some lightShed some light on me pleaseTake it slowTake it easy on meAnd shed some lightShed some light on me pleaseMy moon and meNot as good as we've beenIt's the dirtiest clean I knowMy care, my coatLeave on a high noteThere's nowhere to goThere's nowhere to goTake it slowTake it easy on meAnd shed some lightShed some light on me pleaseTake it slowTake it easy on meAnd shed some lightShed some light on me pleaseMy moonThe moon, my manMy moonThe moon, my manMy moonThe moon, my manMy moonThe moon, my man
