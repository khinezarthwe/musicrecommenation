The colder the night getsThe further she straysAnd he doesn't like itBeing this wayAnd she tried so hardTo steer awayFrom the meeting placeBut her heart had led her thereShe clings to his consciousnessWherever he laysHe struggles to sleep at nightAnd during the dayHe's worried she's waiting in his dreamsTo drag him back to the meeting placeHis love had left him thereWhere the voices still echoes"I'm sorry I met you, darlingI'm sorry I met you"As she turned into the nightAll he had was the words"I'm sorry I met you, darlingI'm sorry I left you"For weeks they had strolled aroundPlaying the foolsThey knew the time would comeAnd time would be cruelBecause it is cruel to everyoneHe is crying out from the meeting placeHe stranded himself thereWhere the voice still echoes"I'm sorry I met you, darlingI'm sorry I met you"As she turned into the nightAll he had was the words"I'm sorry I met you, darlingI'm sorry I left you""I'm sorry I met you, darlingI'm sorry I've left you"
