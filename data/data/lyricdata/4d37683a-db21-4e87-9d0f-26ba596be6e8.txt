One last thing before I shuffle off the planetI will be the one to make you crawlSo I came down to wish you an unhappy birthdaySomeone call the ambulanceThere's gonna be an accidentI'm coming up on infra-redThere is no running that can hide you'Cause I can see in the darkI'm coming up on infra-redForget your running, I will find youOne more thing before we start the final face offI will be the one to watch you fallSo I came down to crash and burn your beggar's banquetSomeone call the ambulanceThere's gonna be an accidentI'm coming up on infra-redThere is no running that can hide you'Cause I can see in the darkI'm coming up on infra-redForget your running, I will find you(I'll find you)(Distorted singing)Someone call the ambulanceThere's gonna be an accidentI'm coming up on infra-redThere is no running that can hide you'Cause I can see in the darkI'm coming up on infra-redForget your running, I will find you'Cause I can see in the darkI'm coming up on infra-redThere is no running that can hide you'Cause I can see in the darkI'm coming up on infra-redForget your running, I will find youI'll find youI'll find you
