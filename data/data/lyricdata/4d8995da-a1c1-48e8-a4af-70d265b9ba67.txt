Well I met you at the blood bankWe were looking at the bagsWondering if any of the colorsMatched any of the names we knew on the tagsYou said "See look that's yours!Stacked on top with your brother'sSee how they resemble one another'sEven in their plastic little covers"And I said I know it wellThat secret that you knowBut you don't know how to tellIt fucks with your honorAnd it teases your headBut you know that it's good girl'Cause it's running you with redThen the snow started fallingWe were stuck out in your carYou were rubbing both my handsChewing on a candy barYou said "Ain't this just like the presentTo be showing up like this"As a moon waned to crescentWe started to kissAnd I said I know it wellThat secret that we knowThat we don't know how to tellI'm in love with your honorI'm in love with your cheeksWhat's that noise up the stairs babe?Is that Christmas morning creaks?And I know it wellI know it wellI know it wellI know it wellI know it wellI know it wellI know it wellI know it well
