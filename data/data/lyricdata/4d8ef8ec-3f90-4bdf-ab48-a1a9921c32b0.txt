I'm on a mission from God We're on a mission On a mission from God We're on a mission On a mission from God We're on a mission On a mission from God! We're on a mission from God! I'm on a mission from God To bring before your eyes To teach a lesson in hate About your world of lies On a mission from God To get your gold Because the army and the Kremlin is Out of control I'm on a mission from God So pledge your sword To hold your hostel in strength So do what you're told! On a mission from God There's nothing more (to be) said Unless conditions are met Your children are dead! Dead! Dead! Dead!
