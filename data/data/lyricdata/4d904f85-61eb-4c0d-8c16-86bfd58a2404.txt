God that was strange to see you againIntroduced by a friend of a friendSmiled and said "Yes, I think we've met before"In that instant it started to pourCaptured a taxi despite all the rainWe drove in silence across Pont ChamplainAnd all of the time you thought I was sadI was trying to remember your name...This scar is a fleck on my porcelain skinTried to reach deep but you couldn't get inNow you're outside meYou see all the beautyRepent all your sinIt's nothing but time and a face that you loseI chose to feel it and you couldn't chooseI'll write you a postcardI'll send you the newsFrom a house down the road from real love...Live through this, and you won't look back...Live through this, and you won't look back...Live through this, and you won't look back...There's one thing I want to say, so I'll be braveYou were what I wantedI gave what I gaveI'm not sorry I met youI'm not sorry it's overI'm not sorry there's nothing to sayI'm not sorry there's nothing to save...
