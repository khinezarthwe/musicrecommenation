Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouthYou pull on your finger, then another finger, then cigaretteThe wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forgetOhhh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicideYou're too old to lose it, too young to choose itAnd the clock waits so patiently on your songYou walk past a cafe, but you don't eat when you've lived too longOh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suicideChev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the roadBut the day breaks instead, so you hurry homeDon't let the sun blast your shadowDon't let the milk float ride your mindYou're so natural, religiously unkindOh no, love, you're not aloneYou're watching yourself, but you're too unfairYou got your head all tangled up, but if I could only make you careOh no, love, you're not aloneNo matter what or who you've beenNo matter when or where you've seenAll the knives seem to lacerate your brainI've had my share, I'll help you with the painYou're not aloneJust turn on with me, and you're not aloneLet's turn on and be not aloneGimme your hands, 'cause you're wonderfulGimme your hands, 'cause you're wonderfulOh, gimme your hands
