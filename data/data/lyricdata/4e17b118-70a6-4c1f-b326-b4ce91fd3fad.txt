I want to live where soul meets bodyAnd let the sun wrap its arms around me andBathe my skin in water cool and cleansing and feelFeel what it's like to be new'Cause in my headThere's a Greyhound stationWhere I send my thoughtsTo far-off destinationsSo they may have a chanceOf finding a place where they'reFar more suited than hereI cannot guess what we'll discoverWhen we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovelsBut I know our filthy hands can wash one another's and not one speck will remainI do believe it's trueThat there are roads left in both of our shoesBut if the silence takes youThen I hope it takes me, tooSo, Brown Eyes, I'll hold you near'Cause you're the only song I want to hearA melody softly soaring through my atmosphereWhere soul meets bodyWhere soul meets bodyWhere soul meets bodyAnd I do believe it's trueThat there are roads left in both of our shoesBut if the silence takes youThen I hope it takes me, tooSo, Brown Eyes, I'll hold you near'Cause you're the only song I want to hearA melody softly soaring through my atmosphereA melody softly soaring through my atmosphereA melody softly soaring through my atmosphereA melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
