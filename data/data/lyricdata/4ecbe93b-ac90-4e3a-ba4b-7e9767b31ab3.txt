There's a silence surrounding meI can't seem to think straightI'll sit in the cornerAnd no one can bother meI think I should speak now (Why won't you talk to me?)I can't seem to speak now (You never talk to me)My words won't come out right (What are you thinking?)I feel like I'm drowning (What are you feeling?)I'm feeling weak now (Why won't you talk to me?)But I can't show my weakness (You never talk to me)I sometimes wonder (What are you thinking?)Where do we go from here (What are you feeling?)(Why won't you talk to me?) I feel like I'm drowning(You never talk to me) You know I can't breathe now(What are you thinking?) We're going nowhere(What are you feeling?) We're going nowhere(Why won't you talk to me?)(You never talk to me)(What are you thinking?)(Where do we go from here?)
