It was an early morning yesterday I was up before the dawn And I really have enjoyed my stay But I must be moving on Like a king without a castle Like a queen without a throne I'm an early morning lover And I must be moving on, yeah, yeah Now I believe in what you say Is the undisputed truth But I have to have things my own way To keep me in my youth Like a ship without an anchor Like a slave without a chain Just the thought of those sweet ladies Sends a shiver through my veins And I will go on shining Shining like brand new I'll never look behind me My troubles will be few Goodbye, stranger, it's been nice Hope you find your paradise Tried to see your point of view Hope your dreams will all come true Goodbye, Mary, goodbye, Jane Will we ever meet again? Feel no sorrow, feel no shame Come tomorrow, feel no pain Sweet devotion It's not for me Just give me motion To set me free In the land and the ocean Far away It's the life I've chosen Every day So goodbye, Mary Goodbye, Jane Will we ever Meet again? Now some they do and some they don't And some you just can't tell And some they will and some they won't With some it's just as well You can laugh at my behaviour And that'll never bother me Say the devil is my saviour But I don't pay no heed And I will go on shining Shining like brand new I'll never look behind me My troubles will be few Goodbye, stranger, it's been nice Hope you find your paradise Tried to see your point of view Hope your dreams will all come true Goodbye, Mary, goodbye, Jane Will we ever meet again? Feel no sorrow, feel no shame Come tomorrow, feel no pain Sweet devotion It's not for me Just give me motion To set me free In the land and the ocean Far away It's the life I've chosen Every day So now I'm leaving Got to go Hit the road I'll say it once again Oh, yes, I'm leaving Got to go Got to go I'm sorry, I must dash So goodbye, Mary Goodbye, Jane Will we ever Meet again? Oh, I'm leaving I've got to go
