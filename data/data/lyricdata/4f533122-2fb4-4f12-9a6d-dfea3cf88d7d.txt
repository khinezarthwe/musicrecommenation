Drinking whiskey reminds me of youYou're the first in ages to have gotten throughI know you mean well, I know that you doBut sooner or later you're going to break me in twoWere my pupils dilated?Could you tell that I liked you?We were so unlikelyYou flirt with an ex, put me to the testStill I want to tell you that I love you the bestWe turned the radiators on and there was no way backDid you knowYou had The Plough star trail on your back?Your voice is quiet and I need it loudIn the night you went upAnd the morning you went downIt's like you to forbid me to say goodnightI had your brown eyes and limbsOn me through the nightThese words are weak and to your dislikeYou'll never believe them so I guess it's alrightDo you like the view I show you?I say look at the lightDo you still miss the way that I hold you?In other towns and citiesWho's holding you tonight?The dresses came out of the bag then the tears cameDrinking has never been the same againI shared your trouble, I shared your weightI lost it with you todayWe don't share a birthday but we do share a signWe shared something or was it all in my mindThere was talk of love and how I need it backI'd be better for you than that last love of mineYou're in another town or cityYou mean nothing to me tonight
