Forgive me, fatherForgive me, GodI know I've sinnedWith no remorseApocalyptic visionsWent through my head here todayGone tomorrowIt's all insaneI'm feeling sickI'm feeling numbThe storm will comeIn the name of GodI'm the chosen oneTerror raids the landTo ashes we'll be sentIn the name of GodLives cast awayMartyrdom of myselfArmageddon comesIn the name of GodNot one more deadFire blasting, cutting edgeChildren burn in flamesIn the name of GodWe're going insaneLet us dieYou don't realizeThis is the timeGod's sacrificeLeaving behindLessons in hateIn the name of GodWe're all deadBurn!
