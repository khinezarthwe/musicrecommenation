I'm sick, you're tiredLet's danceBreak to love, make lustI know it isn'tI'm sick, you're tiredLet's dance, dance, dance, danceCold as numbers but let's danceAs though it were easy for you to lead meI could be passive gracefullyHalf the horizon's goneSkyline of numbersHalf the horizon's goneWorking the numbers'Til I'm sickSleep don't pacify us untilDaybreak sky lights up the grid we live inDizzy when we talk so fastFields of numbers streaming pastI wish we were farmersI wish we knew how toGrow sweet potatoes and milk cowsI wish we were loversBut it's for the bestTonight your ghost will ask my ghost,Where is the love?Tonight your ghost will ask my ghost,Who here is in line for a raise?Tonight your ghost will ask my ghost,Where is the love?Tonight your ghost will ask my ghost,Who put these bodies between us?
