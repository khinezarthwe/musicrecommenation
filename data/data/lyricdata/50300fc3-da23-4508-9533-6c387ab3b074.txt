Suzanne takes you down to her place near the riverYou can hear the boats go by, you can spend the night beside herAnd you know she's half crazy, but that's why you want to be thereAnd she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from ChinaAnd just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give herThen she gets you on her wavelength and she lets the river answerThat you've always been her loverAnd you want to travel with herAnd you want to travel blindAnd you know she will trust youFor you've touched her perfect body with your mindAnd Jesus was a sailor, when he walked upon the waterAnd he spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden towerAnd when he knew for certain, only drowning men could see himHe said: "All men will be sailors then, until the sea shall free them"But he himself was broken long before the sky would openForsaken, almost humanHe sank beneath your wisdom, like a stoneAnd you want to travel with himAnd you want to travel blindAnd you think maybe you'll trust himFor he's touched your perfect body with his mindNow Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the riverShe's wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army countersAnd the sun pours down like honey on our Lady of the HarborAnd she shows you where to look, among the garbage and the flowersThere are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morningThey are leaning out for love and they will lean that way foreverWhile Suzanne holds the mirrorAnd you want to travel with herAnd you want to travel blindAnd you know you can trust herFor she's touched your perfect body with her mind
