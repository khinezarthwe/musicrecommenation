I'm going on a date tonightTo try to fall out of love with youI know, I know, this is a crimeBut I don't know what else to doMy love, you're in a magazineMy love, you're doing fine, you're on TVYou wore my heart out then you ran awayFrom Chicago to Cleveland you made me pay, you made me payWhen you're lucid, you're the sweetest thingI would trade my mother to hear you singWhen you're lucid, you're the sweetest thingI would trade my motherOn the bus radio"50 ways to leave your lover", oh noI laughed at the ironyBut like a stupid, the irony got lost on me, it got lost on meWhen you're lucid, you're the sweetest thingI would trade my mother to hear you singWhen you're lucid, you're the sweetest thingI would trade my motherYou challenged me to write a love songHere it is I think I got it wrongI focused on the negativeThe pain was too much of an incentive, always my incentiveWhen you're lucid, you're the sweetest thingI would trade my mother to hear you singWhen you're lucid, you're the sweetest thingI would trade my mother to hear you songWhen you're lucid, you're the sweetest thingI would trade my mother to hear you singWhen you're lucid, you're the sweetest thingI would trade my motherBut she don't know just how far I'd goWould I walk for a hundred miles for a glimpse of your northern smile?
