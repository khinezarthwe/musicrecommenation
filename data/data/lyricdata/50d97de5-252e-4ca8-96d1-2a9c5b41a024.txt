I'm going on a date tonight To try to fall out of love with you I know, I know, this is a crime But I don't know what else to do My love, you're in a magazine My love, you're doing fine, you're on T V You wore my heart out then you ran away From Chicago to Cleveland you made me pay, you made me pay When you're lucid, you're the sweetest thing I would trade my mother to hear you sing When you're lucid, you're the sweetest thing I would trade my mother On the bus radio"50 ways to leave your lover", oh no I laughed at the irony But like a stupid, the irony got lost on me, it got lost on me When you're lucid, you're the sweetest thing I would trade my mother to hear you sing When you're lucid, you're the sweetest thing I would trade my mother You challenged me to write a love song Here it is I think I got it wrong I focused on the negative The pain was too much of an incentive, always my incentive When you're lucid, you're the sweetest thing I would trade my mother to hear you sing When you're lucid, you're the sweetest thing I would trade my mother to hear you song When you're lucid, you're the sweetest thing I would trade my mother to hear you sing When you're lucid, you're the sweetest thing I would trade my mother But she don't know just how far I'd go Would I walk for a hundred miles for a glimpse of your northern smile?
