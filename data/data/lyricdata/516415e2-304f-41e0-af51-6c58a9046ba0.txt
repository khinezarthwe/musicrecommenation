I know it's not your problem but it's true I never have the time of day for you You don't have fever, you don't have fever You don't have fever, you've got you Walk the streets alone And striking out for home I don't want other loved ones, I want you I don't want other loved ones, I want you You don't have fever You don't have fever You don't have fever You've got you Walk the streets at night You've been lookin' for a fight Sometimes what you're after's not your fault' Cause happy ever after's what you're taught You don't have fever You don't have fever You don't have fever You've got you No one makes you calm though You got people on your arm
