The State of the Nation, violationA broken promise is as good as a lieThe Hell is humongous, the Devil's among usAnd we will burn 'cause we won't uniteWhat are we conceding for freedom?Why does anybody think we need 'em?I would rather fight than let another dieWe're the problem, but we're also the solutionAll hope is goneIf you want it, come and take it from meIf you think you can you still don't know meLet me tell you man, I said it, I meant itAnd I will always have the right to defend itFifty seconds a hundred murdersis a bill of saleWhat will you do when the war is over?What will you do when your system fails?We have made the present obsoleteWhat do you want? What do you need?We'll find a wayWhen all hope is goneWe've seen the fall of the eliteBury your life, take your diseaseWe'll end the worldWhen all hope is goneWe have made the present obsoleteWhat do you want? What do you need?We'll find a wayWhen all hope is goneWe've seen the fall of the eliteBury your life, take your diseaseWe'll end the worldWhen all hope is goneThe wretched are the woundedThe hungry starve to deathIn a place where no one goesThe air itself is a final breathSo discontinueThe antiseptic care charadeAs the cry of justice comesA malignant fire fadesI am the reason your future suffersI am the hatred you won't embraceI am the worm of a pure gestationI am the remedy spit in my faceAll your laws and rules are outdatedAll your subjects are killing the kingsI can rattle off a million other reasons whyBut does it matter when the only thing we love will die?We have made the present obsoleteWhat do you want? What do you need?We'll find a wayWhen all hope is goneWe've seen the fall of the eliteBury your life, take your diseaseWe'll end the worldWhen all hope is goneWe have made the present obsoleteWhat do you want? What do you need?We'll find a wayWhen all hope is goneWe've seen the fall of the eliteBury your life, take your diseaseWe'll end the worldWhen all hope is goneWhen all hope is goneWhen all hope is goneWhen all hope is gone
