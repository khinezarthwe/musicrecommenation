My body is a cage that keeps me from dancing With the one I love but my mind holds the key My body is a cage that keeps me from dancing With the one I love but my mind holds the key I'm standing on a stage of fear and self-doubt It's a hollow play but they'll clap anyway My body is a cage that keeps me from dancing With the one I love but my mind holds the key You're standing next to me My mind holds the key I'm living in an age that calls darkness light Though my language is dead still the shapes fill my head I'm living in an age whose name I don't know Though the fear keeps me moving still my heart beats so slow My body is a cage that keeps me from dancing With the one I love but my mind holds the key You're standing next to me My mind holds the key My body is a My body is a cage, we take what we're given Just because you've forgotten that don't mean you're forgiven I'm living in an age that, screams my name at night But when I get to the doorway there's no one in sight I'm living in an age, they laugh when I'm dancing With the one I love but my mind holds the key You're standing next to me My mind holds the key Set my spirit free Set my spirit free Set my body free Set my body free Set my spirit free Set my body free
