My body is a cage that keeps me from dancingWith the one I love but my mind holds the keyMy body is a cage that keeps me from dancingWith the one I love but my mind holds the keyI'm standing on a stage of fear and self-doubtIt's a hollow play but they'll clap anywayMy body is a cage that keeps me from dancingWith the one I love but my mind holds the keyYou're standing next to meMy mind holds the keyI'm living in an age that calls darkness lightThough my language is dead still the shapes fill my headI'm living in an age whose name I don't knowThough the fear keeps me moving still my heart beats so slowMy body is a cage that keeps me from dancingWith the one I love but my mind holds the keyYou're standing next to meMy mind holds the keyMy body is aMy body is a cage, we take what we're givenJust because you've forgotten that don't mean you're forgivenI'm living in an age that, screams my name at nightBut when I get to the doorway there's no one in sightI'm living in an age, they laugh when I'm dancingWith the one I love but my mind holds the keyYou're standing next to meMy mind holds the keySet my spirit freeSet my spirit freeSet my body freeSet my body freeSet my spirit freeSet my body free
