I looked out this morning and the sun was goneTurned on some music to start my dayThen lost myself in a familiar songI closed my eyes and I slipped awayIt's more than a feeling (More than a feeling)When I hear that old song they used to play (More than a feeling)And I begin dreaming (More than a feeling)'Till I see Marianne walk awayI see my Marianne walkin' awaySo many people have come and goneTheir faces fade as the years go byYet I still recall as I wander onAs clear as the sun in the summer skyIt's more than a feeling (More than a feeling)When I hear that old song they used to play (More than a feeling)And I begin dreaming (More than a feeling)'Till I see Marianne walk awayI see my Marianne walkin' awayWhen I'm tired and thinking coldI hide in my music, forget the dayAnd dream of a girl I used to knowI closed my eyes and she slipped awayShe slipped away!It's more than a feeling (More than a feeling)When I hear that old song they used to play (More than a feeling)And I begin dreaming (More than a feeling)'Till I see Marianne walk away
