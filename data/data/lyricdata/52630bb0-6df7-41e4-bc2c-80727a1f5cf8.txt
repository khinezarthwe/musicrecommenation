Do I stress you out?My sweater is on backwards and inside outAnd you say,I don't want to dissect everything todayI don't mean to pick you apart, you seeBut I can't help itAnd there I go jumping before the gunshot has gone offSlap me with a splintered rulerAnd it would knock me to the floor if I wasn't there alreadyIf only I could hunt the hunterAnd all I really want is some patienceA way to calm the angry voiceAnd all I really want is deliveranceAhh...Do I wear you out?You must wonder why I'm relentless and all strung outI'm consumed by the chill of solitaryI'm like EstellaI like to reel it in and then spit it outI'm frustrated by your apathyAnd I am frightened by the corrupted ways of this landIf only I could meet the MakerAnd I am fascinated by the spiritual manI'm humbled by his humble nature, yeahAnd what I wouldn't give to find a soulmateSomeone else to catch this driftAnd what I wouldn't give to meet a kindredAhh...Enough about me, let's talk about you for a minuteEnough about you, let's talk about life for a whileThe conflicts, the crazinessAnd the sound of pretenses falling all around, all aroundWhy are you so petrified of silence?Here, can you handle this?Did you think about your bills, your ex, your deadlinesOr when you think you're gonna die?Or did you long for the next distraction?And all I need now is intellectual intercourseA soul to dig the hole much deeperAnd I have no concept of time other than it is flyingIf only I could kill the killerAnd all I really want is some peace, manA place to find a common groundAnd all I really want is a wavelengthAhh...And all I really want is some comfortA way to get my hands untiedAnd all I really want is some justiceAhh...
