I woke up todayTo find myself in the other placeWith a trail of my footprintsFrom where I ran awayIt seems everything I've heard just might be trueAnd you know me, well you think you doSometimes, I have everythingYet I wish I felt somethingDo you know how far this has gone?Just how damaged have I become?When I think I can overcomeIt runs even deeperIn a dream I'm a different meWith a perfect you we fit perfectlyFor once in my life I feel completeAnd I still want to ruin itAfraid to look, as clear as dayThis plan has long been underwayI hear them call, I cannot stayThe voice inviting me awayDo you know how far this has gone?Just how damaged have I become?When I think I can overcomeIt runs even deeperEverything that matters is goneAll the hands of hope have withdrawnCould you try to help me hang on?It runsI'm straight, I won't crackOn my way and I can't turn backI'm okay, I'm on trackOn my way and I can't turn backI stayed on this trackGone too far and I can't come backI stayed on this trackLost my way and I can't come backI stayed on this trackGone too far and I can't come backI stayed on this trackLost my way and I can't come backI stayed on this trackGone too far and I can't come backI stayed on this trackLost my way and I can't come back
