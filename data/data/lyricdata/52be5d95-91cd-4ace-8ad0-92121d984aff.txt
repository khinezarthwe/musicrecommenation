I woke up today To find myself in the other place With a trail of my footprints From where I ran away It seems everything I've heard just might be true And you know me, well you think you do Sometimes, I have everything Yet I wish I felt something Do you know how far this has gone? Just how damaged have I become? When I think I can overcome It runs even deeper In a dream I'm a different me With a perfect you we fit perfectly For once in my life I feel complete And I still want to ruin it Afraid to look, as clear as day This plan has long been underway I hear them call, I cannot stay The voice inviting me away Do you know how far this has gone? Just how damaged have I become? When I think I can overcome It runs even deeper Everything that matters is gone All the hands of hope have withdrawn Could you try to help me hang on? It runs I'm straight, I won't crack On my way and I can't turn back I'm okay, I'm on track On my way and I can't turn back I stayed on this track Gone too far and I can't come back I stayed on this track Lost my way and I can't come back I stayed on this track Gone too far and I can't come back I stayed on this track Lost my way and I can't come back I stayed on this track Gone too far and I can't come back I stayed on this track Lost my way and I can't come back
