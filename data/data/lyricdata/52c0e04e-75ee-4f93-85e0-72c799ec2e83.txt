Say you wanna get in And then you wanna get out When you get the money To buy yourself a castle How will you wear your leisure Zipper back and front On the fence together Weekends in leather Flip to the right Slip back to the left For handshakes at the ranch Small talk at the crossroads Rubbing up to the ladder Sucking on every rung Coming up forever and hanging on That's entertainment When the cameras roll Can you face the pavement For a happy dog and pony show Everybody loves you baby Of course they do Do you miss me I miss you Buy this car to drive to work Drive to work to pay for this car
