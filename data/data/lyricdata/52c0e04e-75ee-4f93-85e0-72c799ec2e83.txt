Say you wanna get inAnd then you wanna get outWhen you get the moneyTo buy yourself a castleHow will you wear your leisureZipper back and frontOn the fence togetherWeekends in leatherFlip to the rightSlip back to the leftFor handshakes at the ranchSmall talk at the crossroadsRubbing up to the ladderSucking on every rungComing up forever and hanging onThat's entertainmentWhen the cameras rollCan you face the pavementFor a happy dog and pony showEverybody loves you babyOf course they doDo you miss meI miss youBuy this car to drive to workDrive to work to pay for this car
