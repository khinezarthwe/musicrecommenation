Hey Jackboot, fuck your war!Cause I'm fat and in love and no bombs are fallin' on me for sureBut I'm scared to deathThat I'm livin' a life not worth dying forAnd your ploughshare, it's a swordAnd its wide arcing swing chops the heads off of many thingsMono crops, laughter roarsOh high hilarity! Oh multifarity!Oh standards bearer carry me burnin' home from another tourGo ahead, put your red dress onDays of white robes have come and gone, come and goneOh you rivers, oh you waters runCome bear witness to the whore of Babylonthey called and we caved, we answeredTo a new name. Shout it loud shout it lame! But blackface itYou're such a good dancer. Oh you're a star. You're carnival, Jacaranda petals fallMix with the blood of the saints shot down in the squareDon't track it in on the soles of your shoes when you're dragged into the back of this car!Go ahead, put your red dress onDays of white robes have come and gone, come and goneOh you rivers, oh you waters runCome bear witness to the whore of BabylonIt's a trap, that much is plainStill, maybe send snapshots of all your sweet pain. Playin' torturous gamesIt goes: Lens. Light. Fame. Read my names on your lips. When the man cracks the whipAnd you'll all shake your hips. And you'll all dance to thisWithout making a fist. And I know that it sounds mundaneBut it's a stone cold shame. And they got you tame, and they got me tameGo ahead, put your red dress onDays of white robes have come and gone, come and goneOh you rivers, oh you waters runCome bear witness to the whore of Babylon
