Hey Jackboot, fuck your war! Cause I'm fat and in love and no bombs are fallin' on me for sure But I'm scared to death That I'm livin' a life not worth dying for And your ploughshare, it's a sword And its wide arcing swing chops the heads off of many things Mono crops, laughter roars Oh high hilarity! Oh multifarity! Oh standards bearer carry me burnin' home from another tour Go ahead, put your red dress on Days of white robes have come and gone, come and gone Oh you rivers, oh you waters run Come bear witness to the whore of Babylonthey called and we caved, we answered To a new name. Shout it loud shout it lame! But blackface it You're such a good dancer. Oh you're a star. You're carnival, Jacaranda petals fall Mix with the blood of the saints shot down in the square Don't track it in on the soles of your shoes when you're dragged into the back of this car! Go ahead, put your red dress on Days of white robes have come and gone, come and gone Oh you rivers, oh you waters run Come bear witness to the whore of Babylon It's a trap, that much is plain Still, maybe send snapshots of all your sweet pain. Playin' torturous games It goes: Lens. Light. Fame. Read my names on your lips. When the man cracks the whip And you'll all shake your hips. And you'll all dance to this Without making a fist. And I know that it sounds mundane But it's a stone cold shame. And they got you tame, and they got me tame Go ahead, put your red dress on Days of white robes have come and gone, come and gone Oh you rivers, oh you waters run Come bear witness to the whore of Babylon
