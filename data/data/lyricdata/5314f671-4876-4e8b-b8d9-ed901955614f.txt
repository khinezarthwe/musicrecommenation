Comes the morning When I can feel That there's nothing Left to be concealed Moving on, A scene surreal Know my heart will never Will never be far from here Sure as I'm breathing Sure as I'm sad I'll keep this wisdom In my flesh I'll leave here believing More than I had And there's a reason I'll be Reason I'll be back As I walk The hemisphere I got my wish To up and disappear I've been wounded I've been healed Now for landing I've been Landing I've been cleared Sure as I'm breathing Sure as I'm sad I'll keep this wisdom In my flesh I'll leave here believing More than I had This love has got No ceiling
