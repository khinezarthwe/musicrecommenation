Comes the morningWhen I can feelThat there's nothingLeft to be concealedMoving on,A scene surrealKnow my heart will neverWill never be far from hereSure as I'm breathingSure as I'm sadI'll keep this wisdomIn my fleshI'll leave here believingMore than I hadAnd there's a reason I'll beReason I'll be backAs I walkThe hemisphereI got my wishTo up and disappearI've been woundedI've been healedNow for landing I've beenLanding I've been clearedSure as I'm breathingSure as I'm sadI'll keep this wisdomIn my fleshI'll leave here believingMore than I hadThis love has gotNo ceiling
