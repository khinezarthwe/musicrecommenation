It's late in the eveningShe's wonderin' what clothes to wearShe puts on her make-upAnd brushes her long blonde hairAnd then she asks me, "Do I look all right?"And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"We go to a partyAnd everyone turns to seeThis beautiful ladyIs walkin' around with meAnd then she asks me, "Do you feel all right?"And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"I feel wonderfulBecause I see the love light in your eyesAnd the wonder of it allIs that you just don't realiseHow much I love youIt's time to go home nowAnd I've got an achin' headSo I give her the car keysAnd she helps me to bedAnd then I tell her as I turn out the lightI say, "My darlin', you were wonderful tonightOh, my darlin', you were wonderful tonight"
