Step back and watch the sweet thingBreaking everything she seesShe can take my darkest feelingTear it up till I'm on me kneesPlug into her electric coolWhere things bend and breakAnd shake to the ruleTalking fast couldn't tell me somethingI would shed my skin for youTalking fast on the edge of nothingI would break my back for youDon't know why, don't know whyThings vaporize and rise to the skyAnd we tried so hardAnd we looked so goodAnd we lived our lives in blackBut something about you felt like painYou were my sunny day rainYou were the clouds in the skyYou were the darkest skyBut your lips spoke gold and honeyThat's why I'm happy when it rainsI'm happy when it poursLooking at me enjoying somethingThat feels like, feels like painTo my brainAnd if I tell you somethingYou take me back to nothingI'm on the edge of somethingYou take me backAnd I'm happy when it rainsAnd I'm happy when it rainsAnd I'm happy nowAnd I'm happy when it rainsAnd I'm happy nowAnd I'm happy when it rainsAnd I'm happy nowOh I’m happy nowOh I’m happy when it rains
