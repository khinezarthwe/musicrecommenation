It's one and the same, it's one and the same, oh So what's the use between death and glory? I can't tell between death and glory? Happy endings, no, they never bored me Happy endings, they still don't bore me But they, they have a way A way to make you pay And to make you toe the line Sever the ties Because I'm so clever But clever ain't wise So fuck forever If you don't mind Oh fuck forever! If you don't mind, don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind Oh what's the use between death and glory? I can't tell between death and glory? New Labor and Tory Purgatory and no happy families It's one and the same, one and the same No, it's not the same It's not supposed to be the same You know about that way The way they make you pay And the way they make you toe the line I've severed my ties Oh, you're so clever, you're so clever But you're not very nice So fuck forever If you don't mind Oh I'm stuck forever In your mind, your mind, your mind But have you heard about that way The way they make you pay And when they you toe the line I sever my ties Oh, I'm so clever You're so clever But you're not very nice So fuck forever If you don't mind Oh I'm stuck forever In your mind, your mind, your mind But have you heard about that way To make you feel I should soon make you pay And to make you toe the line, line I sever my ties Oh well I never Sever the ties And fuck forever If you don't mind See I'm stuck forever I'm stuck in your mind, your mind, your mind I never played this on the radio Oh they never played this on the radio
