I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregardA handful of complaints but I can't help the factThat everyone can see these scarsI am what I want you to want, what I want you to feelBut it's like no matter what I do I can't convince youTo just believe this is realSo I let go watching youTurn your back like you always doFace away and pretend that I'm notBut I'll be here 'cause you're all that I gotI can't feel the way I did beforeDon't turn your back on me; I won't be ignoredTime won't heal this damage anymoreDon't turn your back on me; I won't be ignoredI am a little bit insecure, a little unconfidentBecause you don't understand I do what I canBut sometimes I don't make senseI am what you never want to say, but I've never had a doubtIt's like no matter what I do I can't convince youFor once just to hear me outSo I let go, watching youTurn your back like you always doFace away and pretend that I'm notBut I'll be here because you're all that I gotI can't feel the way I did beforeDon't turn your back on me; I won't be ignoredTime won't heal this damage anymoreDon't turn your back on me; I won't be ignoredNo, hear me out nowYou're gonna listen to me like it or notRight now, hear me out nowYou're gonna listen to me like it or notRight nowI can't feel the way I did beforeDon't turn your back on me; I won't be ignoredI can't feel the way I did beforeDon't turn your back on me; I won't be ignoredTime won't heal this damage anymoreDon't turn your back on me; I won't be ignoredI can't feelDon't turn your back on me; I won't be ignoredTime won't healDon't turn your back on me; I won't be ignored
