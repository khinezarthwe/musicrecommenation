I look up to the little birdThat glides across the skyHe sings the clearest melodyIt makes me want to cryIt makes me want to sit right downAnd cry, cry, cryI walk along the city streetsSo dark with rage and fearAnd I, I wish that I could be that birdAnd fly away from hereI wish I had the wings to fly away from hereBut my, my I feel so lowMy, my, where do I go?My, my, what do I know?My, my, we reap what we sowThey always said that you knew best butThis little bird's fallen out of that nest nowI've got a feeling that it might have been blessed soI've just got to put these wings to testFor I am just a troubled soulWho's weighted...Weighted to the groundGive me the strength to carry onTill I can lay this burden downGive me the strength to lay this burden downDown, down, yeahGive me the strength to lay it downBut now, now I feel so lownow, now, where do I go?now, now, what do I know?now, now, we reap what we sowThey always said that you knew best butThis little bird's fallen out of that nest nowI've got a feeling that it might have been blessed soI've just got to put these wings to test
