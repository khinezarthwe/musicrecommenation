An apple and a berry plantComes with a houseOn the grassWho is thatTo come by my houseStands outside my windowSucking on the berries andEats us out of house and homeKeeping us awakeKeeping us awakeCan I come over, I need to restLay down for a whileDisconnectThe night was so longThe day even longerLay down for a whileRecollectFive AMOut againTriangle walksMagpies, I throw sticks at themThey laugh behind my backGetting a feelingMaybe I will dream againHaving that feelingWhen there's no one awakeNo no one awakeCan I come over, I need to restLay down for a whileDisconnectThe night was so longThe day even longerLay down for a whileRecollect
