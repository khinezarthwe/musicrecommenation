Taking to the floor with the wheel to the sky I loosen my tie, I loosen my tie Locking down the door with the rhythm and rhyme I loosen my tie, I loosen my tie Trying to recall what you want me to say I shake it your way, I shake it your way Counting on the night for a beautiful day I shake it your way, I shake it your way And I say you can't get enough No, you can't get enough Given a chance, I wanna be somebody If for one dance, I'm gonna be somebody Open the door, it's gonna make you love me Facing the floor, I'm gonna be somebody Now is your time and you know where you stand With a gun in your hand, with a gun in your hand Now I'm no longer an ordinary man Was this your big plan, your gun in your hand And I say you can't get enough No, you can't get enough Given a chance, I wanna be somebody If for one dance, I'm gonna be somebody Open the door, it's gonna make you love me Facing the floor, I'm gonna be somebody Be somebody Be somebody
