They say it fades if you let itLove was made to forget itI carved your name across my eyelidsYou pray for rain I pray for blindnessIf you still want me, please forgive meThe crown of love has fallen from meIf you still want me, please forgive meBecause the spark is not within meI snuffed it out before my mom walked in my bedroomThe only thing that you keep changingIs your name, my love keeps growingStill the same, just like a cancerAnd you won't give me a straight answerIf you still want me, please forgive meThe crown of love has fallen from meIf you still want me please forgive meBecause your hands are not upon meI shrugged them off before my mom walked in my bedroomThe pains of love and they keep growingIn my heart there's flowers growingOn the grave of our old loveSince you gave me a straight answerIf you still want me, please forgive meThe crown of love is not upon meIf you still want me, please forgive me'Cause the spark is not within meIt's not within me, it's not within meYou gotta be the one, you gotta be the wayYour name is the only word that I can sayYou gotta be the one, you gotta be the wayYour name is the only word, the only word that I can sayThe only word that I can say
