You're standing at the doorI'm falling to the floorYou look even better than you did beforeI'm staring at my feetWondering if I can do thisIt's been a while but I couldn't forget youJust a little look has got me feeling thingsJust a little touch has got me seeing thingsJust a little taste has got me off the chainsDoing things that I don't want toDo it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)Do it like you do it to me (just open up)Don't you know how much I want youWe're sitting real close and I can feel your breathI wanna touch your hand but I lay backCause you know this thing could spiral in the nightI've changed my mind I'm ready for you this timeJust a little look has got me feeling thingsJust a little touch has got me seeing thingsJust a little taste has got me off the chainsDoing things that I don't want toDo it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)Do it like you do it to me (just open up)Don't you know how much I want youDo it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)Do it like you do it to me (just open up)Don't you know how much I want youWe're sitting real close I can feel your breathI wanna touch your hand but I lay backWe're sitting real close I can feel your breathI wanna touch your hand I cannot fight it offDo it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)Do it like you do it to me (just open up)Don't you know how much I want youDo it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)Do it like you do it to me (just open up)Don't you know how much I want you
