I hear the drums echoing tonightBut she hears only whispers of some quiet conversationShe's coming in, 12:30 flightThe moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvationI stopped an old man along the wayHoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodiesHe turned to me as if to sayIt's gonna take a lot to drag me away from youThere's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever doI bless the rains down in AfricaGonna take some time to do the things we never had, ooh-oohThe wild dogs cry out in the nightAs they grow restless, longing for some solitary companyI know that I must do what's rightSure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the SerengetiI seek to cure what's deep insideFrightened of this thing that I've becomeIt's gonna take a lot to drag me away from youThere's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever doI bless the rains down in AfricaGonna take some time to do the things we never had, ooh-oohHurry, boy, she's waiting there for youIt's gonna take a lot to drag me away from youThere's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever doI bless the rains down in AfricaI bless the rains down in AfricaI bless the rains down in AfricaI bless the rains down in AfricaI bless the rains down in AfricaGonna take some time to do the things we never had, ooh-ooh
