It started all in early SeptemberWhen my god-given little became a lot olderGoodbyes seal my broken heartHold on to your teardrops, you got a long way to goDid you get older doing nothing today?Don't you wanna stop complaining?If one is easy then hard is twoNo one knows where you're heading toOnce my private collection, always betting on youNo consolation prizesSpit out your lies and chewing gumCut off your hair - yeah that's it!If you look like that I swear I'm gonna love you moreI thought about this for a long timeNever had the chance to try and make it betterMy heart is waiting for a new youAnd there's no other option on the scheduleLove like ours should never die with yearsOnce you start you can't ever go backwards'Cause if dark is one then bright is twoNo one knows where we're heading toNo matter what it takes, never give up on youI want you to change it allI am gonna make it betterNo consolation prizesSpit out your lies and chewing gumCut off your hair - yeah that's it!If you look like that I swear I'm gonna love you moreNo consolation prizesSpit out your lies and chewing gumCut off your hair - yeah that's it!If you look like that I swear I'm gonna love you moreMore, more, moreMore, more, moreMore, more, more
