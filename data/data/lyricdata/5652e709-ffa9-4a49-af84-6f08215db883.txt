When routine bites hardAnd ambitions are low.And resentment rides highBut emotions won't grow.And we're changing our waysTaking different roads.Then love, love will tear us apart again.Love, love will tear us apart again.Why is the bedroom so coldTurned away on your side?Is my timing that flawedEvery feeling run so dry?Yet there's still this appealThat we've kept through our lives.And love, love will tear us apart again.Love, love will tear us apart again.Do you cry out in your sleep,All my failings expose?Gets a taste in my mouthAs desperation takes hold.Why is it something so goodJust can't function no more?And Love, love will tear us apart again.Love, love will tear us apart again.Love, love will tear us apart again...
