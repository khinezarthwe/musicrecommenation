I can't remember anythingCan't tell if this is true or dreamDeep down inside I feel the screamThis terrible silence stops with meNow that the war is through with meI'm waking up, I cannot seeThat there's not much left of meNothing is real but pain nowHold my breath as I wish for deathOh please God, wake meBack in the womb it's much too realIn pumps life that I must feelBut can't look forward to revealLook to the time when I'll liveFed through the tube that sticks in meJust like a wartime noveltyTied to machines that make me beCut this life off from meHold my breath as I wish for deathOh please God, wake meNow the world is gone I'm just oneOh God help meHold my breath as I wish for deathOh please God, help meDarknessImprisoning meAll that I seeAbsolute horrorI cannot liveI cannot dieTrapped in myselfBody my holding cellLandmine has taken my sightTaken my speechTaken my hearingTaken my armsTaken my legsTaken my soulLeft me with life in hell
