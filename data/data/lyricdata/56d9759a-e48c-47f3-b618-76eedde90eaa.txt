Don't send me letters in bottles anymoreAnd don't come a-knocking or darken my doorWe've got a contract, devotion evermoreWe're legally bonded in richness and in poorI signed the line that was dottedI like to end what I startedI signed the lineAnd I realise a lot of liesWere written in letter and bottles they tend to run agroundDon't give me platinum to weigh down my wristI've got injunctions, so cease and desistI've got a bottle, a ball and a chainBut you have the one thing of value that remainsI signed the line that was dottedI like to end what I startedThere's too much I need, I gotta plead insanitySo don't give me platinum, it just weighs me downI signed the lineI realise a lot of liesWere written in lettersAnd bottles they tend to run aground
