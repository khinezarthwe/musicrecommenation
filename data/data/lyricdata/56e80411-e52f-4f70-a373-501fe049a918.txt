I was born on the banks off a hot muddy riverThe child of one stupid steamy nightBorn to roam beneath the sunWhat do you think of me, I'm better left aloneI met a Holyman that said that he knew the wayAnd he'd like to show me so my life won't go astrayTake my hand child now little boy don't you be afraidI'll take your soul and walk on waterHolyman, ya don't understandThe cuts on me they run much deeperHolyman, you righteous manI've been shown the way a thousand timesNot one a keeperOlder man he said I'll tell you boyYou've planted rotten seedsAnd in a land of happinessThey'll grow us evil treesGuided minds, and eyes that will never seeHolyman I'll tell youJust what it is that I believeHolyman I tell you man you gottaBelieve in what you seeCause its you that corrupt us man andDeep throat philosophyI don't need your spells or the littleGames you try to pull on meCome to think of it I don't need your religionGotta get awayI wish you would understandEverybody praysLet me find my own way
