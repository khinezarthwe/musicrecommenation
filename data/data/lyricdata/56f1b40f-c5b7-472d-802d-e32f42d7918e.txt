My skin is cold, transfusion with somebodyMorose and old, drop into fruitless dyingIt was tempting and bared, the whoring angel risingNow burning prayers, my silent time of losingMy foes, they can't destroy my bodyColliding slow, like life itselfLong for the blur, we cannot dry much longerCement to dirt, disgusted with my cheapnessMy foes, they can't destroy my bodyColliding slow, like life itselfMy foes, they can't destroy my bodyColliding slow, like life itselfReaching down, staring up (at the forgiver)My foes, they can't destroy my bodyColliding slow, like life itselfMy foes, they can't destroy my bodyColliding slow, like life itself
