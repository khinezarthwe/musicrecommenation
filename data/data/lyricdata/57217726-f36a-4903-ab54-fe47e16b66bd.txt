Magpie comes a calling Drops a marble from the sky Tin roof sounds alarming" Wake up child"" Let this be a warning," Says the magpie to the morning Don't let this fading summer pass you by, Don't let this fading summer pass you by. Black hands held so high The vulture wheels and dives Something on the thermals yanked his chain He smelled your boring apex Rotting on the train tracks He laughed under his breath Because you thought that you could outrun sorrow Take your own advice This thundering and lightning gets you rain You run an airtight mission A Cousteau expedition To find a diamond at the bottom of the drain A diamond at the bottom of the drain[ And here I go] Mocking bird sings In the middle of the night All his songs are stolen so he hides He stole them out from whippoorwills And screaming car alarms He sings them for you special He knows you're afraid of the dark Come on sorrow Take your own advice Hide under the bed Turn out the light The stars this night in the sky are ringing out You can almost hear them saying" Close your eyes now, kid"" Close your eyes now, kid"" Morning's teeth are lit" They are waiting, waiting Oh, they are waiting
