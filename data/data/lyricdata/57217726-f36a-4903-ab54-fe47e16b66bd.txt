Magpie comes a callingDrops a marble from the skyTin roof sounds alarming"Wake up child""Let this be a warning,"Says the magpie to the morningDon't let this fading summer pass you by,Don't let this fading summer pass you by.Black hands held so highThe vulture wheels and divesSomething on the thermals yanked his chainHe smelled your boring apexRotting on the train tracksHe laughed under his breathBecause you thought that you could outrun sorrowTake your own adviceThis thundering and lightning gets you rainYou run an airtight missionA Cousteau expeditionTo find a diamond at the bottom of the drainA diamond at the bottom of the drain[And here I go]Mocking bird singsIn the middle of the nightAll his songs are stolen so he hidesHe stole them out from whippoorwillsAnd screaming car alarmsHe sings them for you specialHe knows you're afraid of the darkCome on sorrowTake your own adviceHide under the bedTurn out the lightThe stars this night in the sky are ringing outYou can almost hear them saying"Close your eyes now, kid""Close your eyes now, kid""Morning's teeth are lit"They are waiting, waitingOh, they are waiting
