I heard it from a friendThe Revolution never happenedSighA little dieNo more a childGoodbyeNow where's the woolen sweaterYou mentioned in the letter?ImplyThe other guyAnd scandalize the lionA clean shave in the morningAnd a full beard with no warningTime has gotten by on alibis and wineSuccess is so forbiddingBut it makes me think I'm winningQuietDim the lightsAdopt another lifestyleCome come come onCome come come onCome come come onCome come come onCome come come onCome come come onCome come comeOver and over againYou look like David BowieBut you've nothing new to show meStart another fireand watch it slowly die
