I've got a friend who I've known since I was sevenWe used to talk on the phone, if we have time, if it's the right timeAccompany me by the kitchen sinkWe talk about love, we talk about dishwasher tablets, illnessAnd we dream about heavenI know it, I think I know it from a hymnThey've said so, it doesn't need more explanationA box to open up with light and soundMaking you coldVery coldI leave home at sevenUnder a heavy sky, I ride my bike up, I ride my bike downNovember smoke and your toes go numbA new colour on the GlobeIt goes from white to red, a little voice in my head says oh, oh, ohI know it, I think I know it from a hymnThey've said so, it doesn't need more explanationA box to open up with light and soundAnd if you don'tYou're on your own
