Elope with me, Miss Private, and we'll sail around the worldI will be your Ferdinand and you my wayward girlHow many nights of talking in hotel rooms can you take?How many nights of limping 'round on pagan holidays?Oh, elope with me in private and we'll set something ablazeA trail for the devil to eraseSan Francisco's calling us, the Giants and Mets will playPiazza, New York catcher, are you straight or are you gay?We hung about the stadium, we've got no place to stayWe hung about the Tenderloin and tenderly you tellAbout the saddest book you ever readThat always makes you cryThe statue's crying, too, and well he mayI love you, I've a drowning grip on your adoring faceI love you, my responsibility has found a placeBeside you and strong warnings in the guise of gentle wordsCome wave upon me from the family wider net absurd"You'll take care of her, I know it, you will do a better job"Maybe, but not what she deservesElope with me, Miss Private, and we'll drink ourselves awakeWe'll taste the coffeehouses and award certificatesA privy seal to keep the feel of 1960s styleWe'll comment on the decor and we'll help a passerbyAnd at dusk when work is over we'll continue the debateIn a borrowed bedroom, virginal and spareThe catcher hits for .318 and catches every dayThe pitcher puts religion first and rests on holidaysHe goes into cathedrals and lies prostrate on the floorHe knows the drink affects his speedHe's praying for a doorwayBack into the life he wants and the confession of the benchLife outside the diamond is a wrenchI wish that you were here with me to pass the dull weekendI know it wouldn't come to love, my heroine pretendA lady stepping from the song we love until this dayYou'd settle for an epitaph like "Walk Away, Renee"The sun upon the roof in winter will draw you out like a flowerMeet you at the statue in an hourMeet you at the statue in an hour
