How'd you find me?How did I find you?How can this be true?To be held and understoodKeep it coming - no one's runningThe lesson I'm learningCause blessings are deservedBy the trust that always couldBe it downtown or way up in the airWhen your heart's poundingYou know that I'm awareYou make it easy to watch the world with loveYou make it easy to let the past be doneYou make it easyYou make it easy to watch the world with loveYou make it easy to let the past be doneYou make it easySo watch me fall in love
