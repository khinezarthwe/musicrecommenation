When all this mess will get me down I will depart from ChinatownWeaving in and out of line, the sidewalk's full of merchandiseMy nervous tick has got to quit, my cheeks are chewed down to the bitUp on the roof is still a riot, the hustling crowds still get me tiredI go up there and light a leaf and wish our turn was not so briefI'm paler than a summer blouse that's packed inside a haunted houseI pack my bags and feel the family here is cropped by many handsThat dig and plant me for the spring, come dig me out my lucid brainThis wilderness up in my headThis wilderness up in my headThis wilderness needs to get right out of my clothes and get into my bedroomIs there no reason it can't be the way it was, music and me?My three best friends so casually just letting go so joyfullyBut if I let my wrist get tired, but if I let my spirit cry outThere'll always be that fear of dying or is it just trying to divide?It makes me think my purest dreams are not what they're supposed to beI trick myself when it is hard, I've got to keep up, oh my godAnd hope that I will not be wrong and keep my faith inside a songI'm blooming but my roots remind me not to leave them back in timeThis wilderness up in my headThis wilderness up in my headThis wilderness needs to get right out of my clothes and get into my bedroomLion in a comaSometimes the sun will shine unless I am just feeling fineSometimes I'm not aware where I am or what I careSometimes I'm well to do but I don't know what to doSometimes I don't agree with my thoughts on being freePlease don't leave me, things that feel goodI've been lucky, trying to feel goodSometimes the sun will shine unless I am just feeling fineSometimes I'm not aware where I am or what I careSometimes I'm well to do but I don't know what to doSometimes I don't agree with my thoughts on being freePlease don't leave me, things that feel goodI've been lucky, trying to feel goodLion in a coma, lion in a comaWho wants to smell the fine aromaLion in a coma, lion in a comaWho wants to run but cannot roam, aLion in a coma, lion in a comaWho wants to use his aching bones, aLion in a coma, lion in a comaDon't keep the lion in a comaLion in a coma, lion in a comaWho wants to smell the fine aromaLion in a coma, lion in a comaWho wants to use his aching bones, aLion in a coma, lion in a comaWho wants to run but cannot roam, aLion in a coma, lion in a comaDon't keep the lion in a coma
