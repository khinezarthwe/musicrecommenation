I am all alone this time aroundSometimes on the side I hear a soundPlaces parallel I know it's youFeel the little pieces bleeding throughAnd all this goes onAnd on and on and on and on and on and on and onThis goes onAnd on and on and on and on and on and on and onNow that I've decided not to stayI can feel me start to fade awayEverything is back where it belongsI will be beside you before longAnd on this goes onAnd on and on and on and on and on and on and onThis goes onAnd on and on and on and on and on and on and onOoh, we will never dieOoh, beside you in timeOoh, we will never dieOoh, beside you in time
