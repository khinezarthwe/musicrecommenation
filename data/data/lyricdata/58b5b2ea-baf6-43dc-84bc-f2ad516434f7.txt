Trouble is her only friendAnd he's back againMakes her body older than it really isAnd she says it's high time she went awayNo one's got much to say in this townTrouble is the only way is down, down, downAs strong as you wereTender you goI'm watching you breathingFor the last timeA song for your heartBut when it is quietI know what it meansAnd I'll carry you homeI'll carry you homeIf she had wings she would fly awayAnd another day God will give her someTrouble is the only way is down, down, downAs strong as you wereTender you goI'm watching you breathingFor the last timeA song for your heartBut when it is quietI know what it meansAnd I'll carry you homeI'll carry you homeAnd they were all born pretty in New York City tonightAnd someone's little girl is taken from the world tonightUnder the stars and stripesAs strong as you wereTender you goI'm watching you breathingFor the last timeA song for your heartBut when it is quietI know what it meansAnd I'll carry you homeI'll carry you homeAs strong as you wereTender you goI'm watching you breathingFor the last timeA song for your heartBut when it is quietI know what it meansAnd I'll carry you homeI'll carry you home
