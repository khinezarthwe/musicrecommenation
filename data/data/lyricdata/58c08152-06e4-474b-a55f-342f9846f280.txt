I seem to recognize your faceHaunting, familiar, yetI can't seem to place itCannot find the candle of thought to light your nameLifetimes are catching up with meAll these changes taking placeI wish I'd seen the placeBut no one's ever taken meHearts and thoughts they fadeFade awayHearts and thoughts they fadeFade awayI swear I recognize your breathMemories like fingerprints are slowly raisingMe you wouldn't recallFor I'm not my former--it's hard when you're stuck upon the shelfI changed by not changing at allSmall town predicts my fatePerhaps that's what no one wants to seeI just wanna scream helloMy God, it's been so long, never dreamed you'd returnBut now here you are, and here I amHearts and thoughts, they fadeAwayHearts and thoughts, they fadeFade awayHearts and thoughts, they fadeFade awayHearts and thoughts, they fadeAway, yeahHearts and thoughts, they fadeFade awayHearts and thoughts, they fadeFade awayHearts and thoughts, they fadeFade awayHearts and thoughts, they fade
