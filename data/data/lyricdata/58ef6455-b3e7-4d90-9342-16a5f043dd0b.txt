Every now and then I get a little bit lonelyAnd you're never coming 'roundEvery now and then I get a little bit tiredOf listening to the sound of my tearsEvery now and then I get a little bit nervousThat the best of all the years have gone byEvery now and then I get a little bit terrifiedAnd then I see the look in your eyesEvery now and then I fall apartEvery now and then I fall apartEvery now and then I get a little bit restlessAnd I dream of something wildEvery now and then I get a little bit helplessAnd I'm lying like a child in your armsEvery now and then I get a little bit angryAnd I know I have to get out and cryEvery now and then I get a little bit terrifiedBut then I see the look in your eyesEvery now and then I fall apartEvery now and then I fall apartAnd I need you now tonightAnd I need you more than everAnd if you only hold me tightWe'll be holding on foreverAnd we'll only be making it right'Cause we'll never be wrongTogether we can take it to the end of the lineYour love is like a shadow on me all of the timeI don't know what to do and I'm always in the darkWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparksI really need you tonightForever's gonna start tonightOnce upon a time I was falling in loveNow I'm only falling apartThere's nothing I can doA total eclipse of the heartOnce upon a time there was light in my lifeBut now there's only love in the darkNothing I can sayA total eclipse of the heartEvery now and then I know you'll never be the boyYou always wanted to beBut every now and then I know you'll always be the only boyWho wanted me the way that I amEvery now and then I know there's no one in the universeAs magical and wondrous as youEvery now and then I know there's nothing any betterThere's nothing that I just wouldn't doEvery now and then I fall apartEvery now and then I fall apartAnd I need you now tonightAnd I need you more than everAnd if you only hold me tightWell be holding on foreverAnd we'll only be making it right'Cause we'll never be wrongTogether we can take it to the end of the lineLove is like a shadow on me all of the timeI don't know what to do, I'm always in the darkWe're living in a powder keg and giving off sparksI really need you tonightForever's gonna start tonightOnce upon a time I was falling in loveBut now I'm only falling apartNothing I can doA total eclipse of the heartOnce upon a time there was light in my lifeBut now there's only love in the darkNothing I can sayA total eclipse of the heartA total eclipse of the heartA total eclipse of the heart
