Last night these two bouncers and one of 'em's alright, the other one's the scary oneHis way or no way, totalitarianHe's got no time for you looking or breathing how he don't want you toSo step out the queue, he makes examples of youAnd there's naught you can sayBehind they go through to the bit where you payAnd you realise then that it's finally the timeTo walk back past ten thousand eyes in the lineAnd you can swap jumpers and make another moveInstilled in your brain you've got something to proveTo all the smirking faces and the boys in blackWhy can't they be pleasant? Why can't they have a laugh?He's got his hand in your chest, he wants to give you a duffWell, secretly I think they want it all to kick offThey want arms flying everywhere and bottles as wellIt's just something to talk about, a story to tell youWell, I'm so glad they turned us all away, we'll put it down to fateI said a thousand million things that I could never say this morningGot too deep but how deep is too deep?Well, this town's a different town todaySaid this town's a different town to what it was last nightYou couldn't have done that on a SundayAnd that girl's a different girl todaySaid that girl's a different girl to who you kissed last nightYou couldn't have done that on a SundayOf course notWell, I'm so glad they turned us all away we'll put it down to fateI thought a thousand million things that I would never think this morningGot too deep but how deep is too deep?Last night what we talked aboutIt made so much senseBut now the haze has ascendedIt don't make no sense anymoreSaid, last night what we talked aboutIt made so much senseBut now the haze has ascendedIt don't make no sense anymore, oh
