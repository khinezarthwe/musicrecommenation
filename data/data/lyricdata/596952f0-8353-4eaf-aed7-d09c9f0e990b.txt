16th of June, 9:05, doorbell ringsMan at the door says if I want to stay alive a bit longerThere's three things I need you to know.  ThreeComing from a long line of travelling sales people on my mother's sideI wasn't gonna buy just anyone's cockatooSo why would I invite a complete stranger into my home?Would you?These days are better than thatThese days are better than thatEvery day I die again, and again I'm rebornEvery day I have to find the courageTo walk out into the streetWith arms out, got a love you can't defeatNeither down or outThere's nothing you have that I needI can breatheBreathe now16th of June, Chinese stocks are going upAnd I'm coming down with some new Asian virusJu Ju man, Ju Ju manDoc says you're fine or dying.  Please9:09, St John divine on the line, my pulse is fineBut I'm running down the road like loose electricityWhile the band in my head plays a stripteaseThe roar that lies on the other side of silenceThe forest fire that is fear, so deny itWalk out into the streetSing your heart out, the people we meetWill not be drowned outThere's nothing you have that I needI can breatheBreathe nowWe are people borne of soundThe songs are in our eyesGonna wear them like a crownOhWalk out into the sunburst streetSing your heart out, sing my heart outI've found grace inside a soundI found grace it's all that I've foundAnd I can breatheBreathe now
