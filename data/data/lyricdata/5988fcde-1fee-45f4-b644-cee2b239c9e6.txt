I get all numbWhen she sings it's overSuch a strange numbAnd it brings my knees to the earthAnd God bless you allFor the song you saved usYou're the same numbWhen you sing it's overSuch a strange numbIt could bring back peace to the earthSo God bless you allFor the song you saved usFor the hearts you breakEvery time you moanI get all numbWe're the same numbAnd it brings our knees to the earthSo God bless you allFor the song you saved usFor the hearts you breakEvery time you moanAnd God bless you all on the earth
