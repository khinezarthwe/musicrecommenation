I'm sitting in the railway station, got a ticket for my destination, mmOn a tour of one-night stands, my suitcase and guitar in handAnd every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man bandHomeward boundI wish I wasHomeward boundHome where my thought's escapin'Home where my music's playin'Home where my love lies waitin' silently for meEvery day's an endless stream of cigarettes and magazines, mmAnd each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factoriesAnd every stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to beHomeward boundI wish I wasHomeward boundHome where my thought's escapin'Home where my music's playin'Home where my love lies waitin' silently for meTonight I'll sing my songs again, I'll play the game and pretend, mm-mmBut all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrityLike emptiness in harmony, I need someone to comfort meHomeward boundI wish I wasHomeward boundHome where my thought's escapin'Home where my music's playin'Home where my love lies waitin' silently for meSilently for me
