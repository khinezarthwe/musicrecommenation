Poison oak some boyhood braveryWhen a telephone was a tin can on a stringAnd I fell asleep with you still talking to meYou said you weren't afraid to dieIn Polaroids you were dressed in women's clothesWere you made ashamed? Why'd you lock them in a drawer?Well, I don't think that I ever loved you moreThan when you turned away, when you slammed the doorWhen you stole the car and drove towards MexicoAnd you wrote bad checks, just to fill your armI was young enough, I still believed in warWell, let the poets cry themselves to sleepAnd all their tearful words will turn back into steamBut me I'm a single cell on a serpent's tongueThere's a muddy field where a garden wasAnd I'm glad you got away but I'm still stuck out hereMy clothes are soaking wet from your brother's tearsAnd I never thought this life was possibleYou're the yellow bird that I've been waiting forThe end of paralysis, I was a statuetteNow I'm drunk as hell on a piano benchAnd when I press the keys it all gets reversedThe sound of loneliness makes me happier
