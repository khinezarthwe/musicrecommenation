I remember way back way back whenI said I never wanna see your face again'Cause you were loving, yes, you were loving somebody elseAnd I knew, oh yes, I knew I couldn't control myselfAnd now they bring you back into my life againAnd so I put on a face just like your friendsBut I think you know, oh yes, you know what's going on'Cause the feelings in me, oh yes, in me are burning strongBut I will never be your stepping stoneTake it all or leave me aloneI will never be your stepping stoneI'm standing upright on my ownYou used call me up from time to timeAnd it would be so hard for me not to cross the lineThe words of love lay on my lips just like a curseAnd I knew, oh yes, I knew they'd only make it worseAnd now you have the nerve to play alongJust like the maestro beats in your songYou get your kicks, you get your kicks from playing meAnd the less you give, the more I want, so foolishlyBut I will never be your stepping stoneTake it all or leave me aloneI will never be your stepping stoneI'm standing upright on my own...No, I will never be your stepping stoneTake it all or leave me aloneI will never be your stepping stoneI'm standing upright on my ownNever be your stepping stoneTake it all or leave me aloneI will never be your stepping stoneI'm standing upright on my own
