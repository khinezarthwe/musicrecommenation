A long time agoI never knew myselfThen the memory of shameBirthed its giftNo more the small oneThe weak one, the frightened oneRunning from beatings, deflatingI'm becoming more than a manMore than you ever wereDriven and burningTo rise beyond JesusI'm born againWith snakes' eyesBecoming god-sizedI found my life was slippingThrough my handsPerhaps through deathMy life won't be so badI can see you, can fuck youInside of youStaring through your eyesBelittle your friendsTo serve me, to suck meTo realize my saving graspI of suicide, I the unlordI'm born againWith snakes' eyesBecoming god-sizedI'm born againWith snakes' eyesBecoming god-sized
