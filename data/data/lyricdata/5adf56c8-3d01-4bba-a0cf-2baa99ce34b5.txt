Jane, I've made it plain, Although I'm faded as a ghost I want you here inside me, Say the word. Oh, you've been playing nice, But I can see it in your eyes You're thinking, " Christ, He's everybody's girl." You can't spend the night... Jane, I've seen you at the club You were tearin' up the rug With no regard for form, You're such a brute! You had a ready elbow For the girls you hate or just don't know. You head-butt me, Cos you thought it was cute. Yes, I'm sure you're right Yeah, I'm sure you're right. Yes, I'm sure you're right. But we could spend the night together Jane, I've seen the pain you've dealt You've been with all my friends You tell me guard my heart, I might get hurt. No doubt you'll hurt my feelings, And it's a given I'll be kneeling But I'm telling myself That it's gonna be worth it. Yes, I'm sure you're right Yeah, I'm sure you're right. Yes, I'm sure you're right. But we could spend the night together
