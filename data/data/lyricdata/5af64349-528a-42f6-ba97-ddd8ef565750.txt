Crickets are chirpin', the water is high,There's a soft cotton dress on the line hangin' dry,Windows wide open, African treesBent over backwards from a hurricane breeze.Not a word of goodbye, note even a note,She gone with the manIn the long black coat.Somebody seen him hanging aroundAt the old dance hall on the outskirts of town,He looked into her eyes when she stopped in to askIf he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask.Somebody said from the Bible he'd quoteThere was dust on the manIn the long black coat.Preacher was a talkin' there's a sermon he gave,He said every man's conscience is vile and depraved,You cannot depend on it to be your guideWhen it's you who must keep it satisfied.It ain't easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat,She gave her heart to the manIn the long black coat.There are no mistakes in life some people sayIt is true sometimes you can see it that way.Bridge: But people don't live or die, people just float.She went with the manIn the long black coat.There's smoke on the water, it's been there since June,Tree trunks uprooted, 'neath the high crescent moonFeel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling forceSomebody is out there beating on the dead horse.She never said nothing there was nothing she wrote,She gone with the manIn the long black coat.
