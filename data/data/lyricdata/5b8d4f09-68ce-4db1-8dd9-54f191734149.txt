Every time we lie awakeAfter every hit we takeEvery feeling that I getBut I haven't missed you yetEvery roommate kept awakeBy every sigh and scream we makeAll the feelings that I getBut I still don't miss you yetOnly when I stop to think about itI hate everything about youWhy do I love you?I hate everything about youWhy do I love you?Every time we lie awakeAfter every hit we takeEvery feeling that I getBut I haven't missed you yetOnly when I stop to think about itI hate everything about youWhy do I love you?I hate everything about youWhy do I love you?Only when I stop to think about you I knowOnly when you stop to think about me, do you know?I hate everything about youWhy do I love you?You hate everything about meWhy do you love me?I hate, you hateI hate, you love me!I hate everything about youWhy do I love you?
