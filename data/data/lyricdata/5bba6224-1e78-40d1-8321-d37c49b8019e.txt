We all came out to MontreuxOn the Lake Geneva shorelineTo make records with a mobileWe didn't have much timeA-Frank Zappa and the MothersWere at the best place aroundBut some stupid with a flare gunBurned the place to the groundSmoke on the waterA fire in the skySmoke on the waterThey burned down the gambling houseIt died with an awful soundA-Funky Claude was running in and outPulling kids out the groundWhen it all was overWe had to find another placeBut Swiss time was running outIt seemed that we would lose the raceSmoke on the waterA fire in the skySmoke on the waterWe ended up at the Grand HotelIt was empty, cold and bareBut with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside, hehMaking our music thereWith a few red lights, heh, a few old beds, hehWe made a place to sweatNo matter what we get out of this, hehI know, I know we'll never forgetSmoke on the waterA fire in the skySmoke on the water
