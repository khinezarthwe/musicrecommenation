We all came out to Montreux On the Lake Geneva shoreline To make records with a mobile We didn't have much time A- Frank Zappa and the Mothers Were at the best place around But some stupid with a flare gun Burned the place to the ground Smoke on the water A fire in the sky Smoke on the water They burned down the gambling house It died with an awful sound A- Funky Claude was running in and out Pulling kids out the ground When it all was over We had to find another place But Swiss time was running out It seemed that we would lose the race Smoke on the water A fire in the sky Smoke on the water We ended up at the Grand Hotel It was empty, cold and bare But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside, heh Making our music there With a few red lights, heh, a few old beds, heh We made a place to sweat No matter what we get out of this, heh I know, I know we'll never forget Smoke on the water A fire in the sky Smoke on the water
