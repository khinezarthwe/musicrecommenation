I was lost in the lakesAnd the shapes that your body makesThat your body makes, that your body makesThat your body makesAnd the mountains said I could find you hereThey whispered the snow and the leaves in my earI traced my finger along your trailsYour body was the map, I was lost in itFloating over your rocky spineThe glaciers made you, and now you're mineFloating over your rocky spineThe glaciers made you, and now you're mineI was moving 'cross your frozen veneerThe sky was dark but you were clearCould you feel my footstepsAnd would you shatter, would you shatter, would youAnd with your soft fingers between my clawsLike purity against resolveI could tell, then and there, we were formed from the clayAnd came from the rocks for the earth to displayThey told me to be careful up thereWhere the wind blows a venomous rage through your hairThey told me to be careful up thereWhere the wind rages through your hair
