Sensitized by every word that you sayBoy you got me messed upBut I like it that wayTantalised just too good to refuseWhen I try to stop yaYou keep blowing my fuseCan't deny how hot I'm feelingIf my body could fly I'd hit the ceiling'Cause I can't hold back the minute I tryBaby you trip the switch and I'm sensitizedEvery touch whatever you do baby you trip the switchI turn on for youI turn on for youEnergised by all the pleasure and painBoy you got that something that burns a spark to a flameLook at me you've got me begging for more'Cause you got that one thing I ain't discovered beforeCan't deny how rude I'm feelingIf my body could talk you'd hear me screaming'Cause I can't hold back the minute I tryBaby you trip the switch and I'm sensitizedEvery touch whatever you do baby you trip the switchI turn on for youI turn on for youI'm sensitized tonight and you can watch me come aliveI'm sensitized tonight and you can watch me come aliveI'm sensitized tonight and you can watch me come aliveI'm sensitized tonight I'm sensitized tonightI can't hold back the minute I tryBaby you trip the switch and I'm sensitizedEvery touch whatever you do baby you trip the switchI turn on for youI turn on for youI can't hold back the minute I tryBaby you trip the switch and I'm sensitizedEvery touch whatever you do baby you trip the switchI turn on for youI turn on for youI come aliveBaby and you know it's true I feel this for youI come aliveBaby and you know it's true I feel this for you
