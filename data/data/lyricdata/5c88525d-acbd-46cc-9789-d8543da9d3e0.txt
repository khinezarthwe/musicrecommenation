No one said We'd ever know each other A new evidence is what we require In this world I stand on the edge of a broken sky And I'm looking down, don't know why And if I should fall, would you hold me? Would you pass me by?

Would you pass me by? Ooh, you know I'd ask you for nothing Just to wait for a while
