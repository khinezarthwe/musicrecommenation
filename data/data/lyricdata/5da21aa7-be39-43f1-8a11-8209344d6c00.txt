Dancing alone again, again the rain fallingOnly the scent of you remains to dance with meNobody showed me how to return the Love you give to meMom never holds me, Dad loves a stranger more than meI never wanted to ever bring you downAll that I need are some simple loving wordsYou touched my body once, it burns me still softlyNever forgets, never again will be, I cryOut of my head and I don't know what I foundOver and over I feel it break me downOn the sidewalk of the city are my screams just a whisperBusy people going nowhere see me soak in the rainNo compassion, nothing matters, my resistence is waningLike a flower in the basement waiting for a lonely deathOut of my head and I don't know what I foundOver and over I feel it break me downOn the sidewalk of the city are my screams just a whisperBusy people going nowhere see me soak in the rainNo compassion, nothing matters, my resistence is waningLike a flower in the basement waiting for a lonely death
