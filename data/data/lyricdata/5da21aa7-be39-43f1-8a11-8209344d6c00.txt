Dancing alone again, again the rain falling Only the scent of you remains to dance with me Nobody showed me how to return the Love you give to me Mom never holds me, Dad loves a stranger more than me I never wanted to ever bring you down All that I need are some simple loving words You touched my body once, it burns me still softly Never forgets, never again will be, I cry Out of my head and I don't know what I found Over and over I feel it break me down On the sidewalk of the city are my screams just a whisper Busy people going nowhere see me soak in the rain No compassion, nothing matters, my resistence is waning Like a flower in the basement waiting for a lonely death Out of my head and I don't know what I found Over and over I feel it break me down On the sidewalk of the city are my screams just a whisper Busy people going nowhere see me soak in the rain No compassion, nothing matters, my resistence is waning Like a flower in the basement waiting for a lonely death
