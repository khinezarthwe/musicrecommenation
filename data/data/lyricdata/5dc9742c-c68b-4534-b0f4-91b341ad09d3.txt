What's coming through is alive What's holding up is a mirror What's singing songs is a snake...it is Looking to turn my piss to wine They're both totally void of hate And killing me just the same now The snake behind me hisses What my damage could have been My blood before me begs me Open up my heart again And I feel this coming over like a storm again...now Considerately Venomous voice tempts me Drains me, bleeds me Leaves me cracked and empty Drags me down like some sweet gravity The snake behind me hisses What my damage could have been My blood before me begs me Open up my heart again And I feel this coming over like a storm again...now And I feel this coming over like a storm again...now I am too connected to you To slip away or fade away Daze away, I still feel you Touching me, changing me And...considerately killing me Considerately killing me And...considerately killing me Considerately killing me And... Without the skin peeled Beneath the storm Under these tears now The walls came down As the snake is drowned As I look in his eyes My fear begins to fade Recalling all of the times I could have cried...then I should have cried...then And as the walls come down And as I look in your eyes My fear begins to fade Recalling all of the times I have died and will die It's all right I don't mind I don't mind I don't mind! I am too connected to you To slip away or fade away Daze away, I still feel you Touching me, changing me And...considerately killing me Considerately killing me And...considerately killing me
