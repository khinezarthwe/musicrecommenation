What's coming through is aliveWhat's holding up is a mirrorWhat's singing songs is a snake...it isLooking to turn my piss to wineThey're both totally void of hateAnd killing me just the same nowThe snake behind me hissesWhat my damage could have beenMy blood before me begs meOpen up my heart againAnd I feel this coming over like a storm again...nowConsideratelyVenomous voice tempts meDrains me, bleeds meLeaves me cracked and emptyDrags me down like some sweet gravityThe snake behind me hissesWhat my damage could have beenMy blood before me begs meOpen up my heart againAnd I feel this coming over like a storm again...nowAnd I feel this coming over like a storm again...nowI am too connected to youTo slip away or fade awayDaze away, I still feel youTouching me, changing meAnd...considerately killing meConsiderately killing meAnd...considerately killing meConsiderately killing meAnd...Without the skin peeledBeneath the stormUnder these tears nowThe walls came downAs the snake is drownedAs I look in his eyesMy fear begins to fadeRecalling all of the timesI could have cried...thenI should have cried...thenAnd as the walls come downAnd as I look in your eyesMy fear begins to fadeRecalling all of the timesI have died and will dieIt's all rightI don't mindI don't mindI don't mind!I am too connected to youTo slip away or fade awayDaze away, I still feel youTouching me, changing meAnd...considerately killing meConsiderately killing meAnd...considerately killing me
