Yeah, yeahHigh, higher than the sunYou shoot me from a gunI need you to elevate me hereAt the corner of your lipsAs the orbit of your hipsEclipse, you elevate my soulI've got no self-controlBeen living like a mole nowGoing down, excavationI and I in the skyYou make me feel like I can fly so highElevationA star lit up like a cigarStrung out like a guitarMaybe you could educate my mindExplain all these controlsI can't sing but I've got soulThe goal is elevationA mole, digging in a holeDigging up my soul nowGoing down, excavationI and I in the skyYou make me feel like I can fly so highElevationLove, lift me out of these bluesWon't you tell me something trueI believe in youA mole, digging in a holeDigging up my soul nowGoing down, excavationI and I in the skyYou make me feel like I can fly so highElevationElevationElevationElevationElevation
