I talk to no-one Oh, you're invisible And with this venomous tongue None of it's true And I can taste it You see, it's in the heavens Merciful forever And now I understand Could I maybe get over you And you get over me Could I maybe get over you And you get over me And more I just see you And more and more I just see you This is the first day I walk the rolling hills again Where I can make plans With pictures too Tender trouble It's almost lovable I feel the weight of the trees Beat on my chest Could I maybe get over you And you get over me Could I maybe get over you And you get over me And more I just see you And more and more I just see you Feel bad Say so Feel good Let it go Feel bad Say so Feel good Let it go And more I just see you And more I just see you
