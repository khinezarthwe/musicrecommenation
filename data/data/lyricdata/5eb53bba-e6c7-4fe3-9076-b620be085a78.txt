Apartment in New York, London and ParisWhere will we rest, we're all living on top of itIt's all that we have the USA's our daily breadAnd no one is willing to share itWhy can't we see our fortunancyLiving as legends have livedBane and dismanneredWe coax all the timeKnowing that nothing is left when we dieCome along Fool,A direct hit to the senses you're disconnectedIt's not that it's bad, it's not that it's deathIt's just that it's on the tip of your tongue and you're so silentWanting to live and laugh all the timeSitting alone with you tea and your crimeChildren with kids and people with parentsAny which way there's no past and no presentWhen the day comes and all of them bumsWill reveal enchanting personsCome along Fool,A direct hit to the senses you're disconnectedIt's not that it's bad, it's not that it's deathIt's just that it's on the tip of your tongue and you're so silentWhen it's a rut and baby's no luckHalf of it's misunderstanding loveThe war we have won we're winning againWithin ourselves and within our friendsCome along Fool,A direct hit to the senses you're disconnectedIt's not that it's bad, it's not that it's deathIt's just that it's on the tip of your tongue and you're so silent
