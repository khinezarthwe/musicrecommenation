Eyes are sober and this is the planI'm sitting in a car heading NeverlandA fancy man a fancy manHe's pointing with the fingers that are left on his handEyes are hazel but far too coldLooking out for loveBut none of us canWhere's the monkey that I've been told ofI'm staring at the moneyThat burns in my handI'm dancing for dollarsAnd for a fancy manCome right overI'll knock on your shoulderThis is a story and this is what I've plannedAn angry man an angry manNothing is more fatal than an angry manVulnerable heightsFeed the hand that bites meFollowing the steam into another roomStanding in the cornerIs this my homeShowing us love that none of us canI'm singing for moneyThat burns in my handTell meWill I make it home tonightI'm doing it for dollars and for a fancy manI've got a lot of money that burns in my hand
