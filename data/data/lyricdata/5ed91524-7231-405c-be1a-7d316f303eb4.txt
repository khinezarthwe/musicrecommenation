All I want is a room with a view A sight worth seeing, a vision of you All I want is a room with a view I will give you my finest hour The one I spent watching you shower I will give you my finest hour All I want is a photo in my wallet A small rememberance of something more solid All I want is a picture of you Picture this - a day in December Picture this - feezing cold weather You got clouds on your lids And you'd be on the skids If it weren't for your job at the garage If you could only Picture this - a sky full of thunder Picture this - my telephone number One and one is what I'm telling you All I want is 20-20 vision A total portrait with no omissions All I want is a vision of you If you can Picture this - a day in December Picture this - feezing cold weather You got clouds on your lids And you'd be on the skids If it weren't for your job at the garage If you could only Picture this - a sky full of thunder Picture this - my telephone number One and one is what I'm telling you Get a pocket computer Try to do what ya used to do
