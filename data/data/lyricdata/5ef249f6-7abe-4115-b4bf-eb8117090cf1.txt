Death is her boyfriendShe spits on summers and smiles to the nightShe collects crowns made of black rosesBut her heart is made of bubble gumGraveyard girlDark rags and red starsShe's the dirty witch of her high schoolShe worships Satan like a fatherBut dreams of a sister like Molly Ringwald"I'm gonna jump the walls and runI wonder if they'll miss me?I won't miss themThe cemetery is my homeI want to be a part of itInvisible even to the nightThen I'll read poetry to the stonesMaybe one day I could be one of them...Wise and silentWaiting for someone to love meWaiting for someone to kiss meI'm fifteen years oldAnd I feel it's already too late to liveDon't you?"I can't help my loveFor Graveyard Girl
