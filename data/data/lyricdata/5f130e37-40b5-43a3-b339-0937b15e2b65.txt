Have you ever wonderedIf it smarts when your heart is ignoredAnd the sore becomes worse?Though I waited for you,Oh, how I adore you.You never saw my face.I traced your path each day.We will be always together.Now I watch you bleed.You had all I need.How I love you so,Now we'll never know,If I can't have you.I even did the research,Went to work, learned to flirt,Wore a skirt and faced dirt and it hurt,And still you didn't notice,You never focused on me.You never saw my face.I traced your path each day.You never lifted your eyes to meet mine.Now I watch you bleed.You had all I need.How I love you so,Now we'll never know.Now I watch you bleed.You had all I need.How I love you so,Now we'll never know,If I can't have you,If I can't have you,If I can't have you,If I can't have you.
