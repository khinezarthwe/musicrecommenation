When it started, we had high hopesNow my back's on the line, my back's on the ropesWhen it started, we were alrightBut night makes a fool of us in the daylightThere we were dying of frustrationSinging, "Lord lead me not into temptation"But it's not easy when she turns you onSin, stay goneIf you'd only, if you'd only say yesWhether you will's anybody's guessGod, only God knows I'm trying my bestBut I'm just so tired of this lonelinessSo, up they picked me by the big toeI was held from the rooftop, then they let goDizzily screaming, "Let the windows down"As I crawl to the groundIf you'd only, if you'd only say yesWhether you will's anybody's guessGod, only God knows she won't let me restBut I'm just so tired of this lonelinessI've become so tired of this loneliness
