Oh no, I seeA spider web, it's tangled up with meAnd I lost my headThe thought of all the stupid things I'd saidOh no, what's this?A spider web, and I'm caught in the middleSo I turned to runThe thought of all the stupid things I'd doneI never meant to cause you troubleI never meant to do you wrongAnd I, well if I ever caused you troubleOh no, I never meant to do you harmOh no, I seeA spider web and it's me in the middleSo I twist and turnHere am I in my little bubbleSinging I never meant to cause you troubleI never meant to do you wrongAnd I, well if I ever caused you troubleOh no, I never meant to do you harmThey spun a web for meThey spun a web for meThey spun a web for me
