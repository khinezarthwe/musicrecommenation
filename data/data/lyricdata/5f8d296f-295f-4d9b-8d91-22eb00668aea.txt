What was it like to seeThe face of your own stability?Suddenly look awayLeaving you with the dead and hopelessEleven and she was goneEleven is when we waved goodbyeEleven is standing still,Waiting for me to free himBy coming home.Moving me with a soundOpening me within a gesture.Drawing me down and in,Showing me where it all began,Eleven.He was too scarred to realizeYou were the voice that's been calling me back home.Under a dead Ohio skyEleven has been and will be waiting,Defending his light,And wonderingWhere the hell have I been?Sleeping, lost and numbI'm so glad that I have found you.I am wide awake and heading home.I wish that I could see youTurn around to playDreams are fadingCarry my ancient soulCarry me into the lightAim your body heavenlyEnduring a memoryHold your light,Hold your light,Hold your light where I can see itHold your light,Eleven.Lead me through each gentle step by stepBy inch by loaded memory.I'll move to healAs soon as pain allows so we canReunite and both move on together.Hold your light,Eleven. Lead me through each gentle stepBy stepBy inch by loaded memoryTill one and one are one, Eleven,So glow, child, glowI'm heading back home.
