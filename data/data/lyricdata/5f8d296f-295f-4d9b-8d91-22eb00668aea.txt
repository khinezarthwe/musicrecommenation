What was it like to see The face of your own stability? Suddenly look away Leaving you with the dead and hopeless Eleven and she was gone Eleven is when we waved goodbye Eleven is standing still, Waiting for me to free him By coming home. Moving me with a sound Opening me within a gesture. Drawing me down and in, Showing me where it all began, Eleven. He was too scarred to realize You were the voice that's been calling me back home. Under a dead Ohio sky Eleven has been and will be waiting, Defending his light, And wondering Where the hell have I been? Sleeping, lost and numb I'm so glad that I have found you. I am wide awake and heading home. I wish that I could see you Turn around to play Dreams are fading Carry my ancient soul Carry me into the light Aim your body heavenly Enduring a memory Hold your light, Hold your light, Hold your light where I can see it Hold your light, Eleven. Lead me through each gentle step by step By inch by loaded memory. I'll move to heal As soon as pain allows so we can Reunite and both move on together. Hold your light, Eleven. Lead me through each gentle step By step By inch by loaded memory Till one and one are one, Eleven, So glow, child, glow I'm heading back home.
