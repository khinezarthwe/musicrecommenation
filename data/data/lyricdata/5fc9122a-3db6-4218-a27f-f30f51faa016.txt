I don't know what you're looking forYou haven't found it, baby, that's for sureYou rip me up, you spread me all aroundIn the dust of the deed of timeAnd this is not a case of lust, you seeIt's not a matter of you versus meIt's fine the way you want me on your ownBut in the end it's always me aloneI'm losing my favourite gameYou're losing your mind againI'm losing my babyLosing my favourite gameI only know what I've been working forAnother you so I could love you moreI really thought that I could take you thereBut my experiment is not getting us anywhereI had a vision I could turn you rightA stupid mission and a lethal fightI should have seen it when my hope was newMy heart is black and my body is blueAnd I'm losing my favourite gameYou're losing your mind againI'm losing my favourite gameYou're losing your mind againI'm losing my babyLosing my favourite gameI'm losing my favourite game (I'm losing my favourite game)You're losing your mind again (I tried)I tried (I tried) but you're still the same (I tried)I'm losing my babyYou're losing a saviour and a saint
