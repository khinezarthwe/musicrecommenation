So long sitting hereDidn't hear the warningWaiting for the tape to runWe've been moving around in different situationsKnowing that the time would comeJust to see you torn apartWitness to your empty heartI need itI need itI need itThrough the wire screen, the eyes of those standing outside looked in at her as into the cage of some rare creature in a zooIn the hand of one of the assistants she saw the same instrument which they had that morning inserted deep into her bodyShe shuddered instinctivelyNo life at all in the house of dollsNo love lostNo love lostYou've been seeing thingsIn darkness, not in learningHoping that the truth will passNo life underground, wasting never changingWishing that this day won't lastTo never see you show your ageTo watch until the beauty fadesI need itI need itI need it
