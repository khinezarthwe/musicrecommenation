One, two, three, fourOh, my talking birdThough you know so few wordsThey're on infinite repeatLike your brain can't keep up with your beakAnd you're kept in an open cageSo you're free to leave or stayAnd sometimes you get confusedLike there is a hint that I'm trying to give youThe longer you thinkThe less you'll know what to doIt's hard to see your way outWhen you live in a house in a house'Cause you don't realizeThat the windows were open the whole timeBut, oh, my talking birdThough your feathers are tattered and furledI'll love you all the dayTill the breath leaves your delicate frameIt's all here for youAs long as you choose to stay, heyIt's all here for youAs long as you don't fly away
