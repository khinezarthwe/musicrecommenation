I am Jeremiah DixonI am a Geordie BoyA glass of wine with you, sirAnd the ladies I'll enjoyAll Durham and NorthumberlandIs measured up by my own handIt was my fate from birthTo make my mark upon the earth...He calls me Charlie MasonA stargazer am IIt seems that I was bornTo chart the evening skyThey'd cut me out for baking breadBut I had other dreams insteadThis baker's boy from the west countryWould join the Royal Society...We are sailing to PhiladelphiaA world away from the coaly TyneSailing to PhiladelphiaTo draw the lineThe Mason-Dixon lineNow you're a good surveyor, DixonBut I swear you'll make me madThe West will kill us bothYou gullible Geordie ladYou talk of libertyHow can America be freeA Geordie and a baker's boyIn the forest of the Iroquois...Now hold your head up, MasonSee America lies thereThe morning tide has raisedThe capes of DelawareCome up and feel the sunA new morning is begunAnother day will make it clearWhy your stars should guide us here...We are sailing to PhiladelphiaA world away from the coaly TyneSailing to PhiladelphiaTo draw the lineThe Mason-Dixon line
