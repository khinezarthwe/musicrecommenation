The heart is a bloomShoots up through the story groundThere's no roomNo space to rent in this townYou're out of luckAnd the reason that you had to careThe traffic is stuckAnd you're not moving anywhereYou thought you'd found a friendTo take you out of this placeSomeone you could lend, a handIn return for graceIt's a beautiful dayThe sky fallsAnd you feel likeIt's a beautiful dayDon't let it get awayYou're on the roadBut you've got no destinationYou're in the mudIn the maze of her imaginationYou love this townEven if it doesn't ring trueYou've been all overAnd it's been all over youIt's a beautiful dayDon't let it get awayIt's a beautiful dayTouch meTake me to that other placeTeach meI know I'm not a hopeless caseSee the world in green and blueSee China right in front of youSee the canyons broken by cloudSee the tuna fleets clearing the sea outSee the Bedouin fires at nightSee the oil fields at first light andSee the bird with a leaf in her mouthAfter the flood all the colours came outIt was a beautiful dayDon't let it get awayBeautiful dayTouch meTake me to that other placeReach meI know I'm not a hopeless caseWhat you don't have you don't need it nowWhat you don't know you can feel it somehowWhat you don't have you don't need it nowDon't need it nowIt's a beautiful day
