After the stormHad passedI wondered how longThe break in the clouds would lastI saw something in your eyesI'm sureOh baby I saw itSomething in your eyesI wanted it for myselfI sit and I waitAnd I stareStill wishing for a divine interventionTo lift me from my chairI saw something in your eyesI'm sureOh baby I saw itSomething in your eyesI saw something in your eyesI'm sureOh baby I saw itSomething in your eyesI wanted it for myselfYou and I we've come so farWe've reached beyond the farthest starTime and time and time againI want you backYou were my friendWe can pretendI saw something in your eyesI'm sureOh baby I saw itSomething in your eyesI wanted it for myself
