I never knew this could happen to meI know now fragilityI know there's people who I haven't toldI know of people who are getting oldWish I could speak in just one sweepWhat you are and what you mean to meInstead I mumble randomlyYou stand by and enlighten meIn a dream I lost my teeth againCalling me woman and half manYes in a dream all my teeth fell outA cracked smile and a silent shoutA cracked smile and a silent shoutIf I explain it once thoroughlyHe'll have you later 'cause it's never freeYou were at the gigantic spreeI caught a glimpse now it haunts meI caught a glimpse now it haunts me
