This is the greatest and best song in the world Tribute Long time ago, me and my brother Kyle here We was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road All of a sudden There shined a shiny demon In the middle of the road And he said!" Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your souls" Well, me and Kyle We looked at each other And we each said" Okay" And we played the first thing that came to our heads Just so happened to be The best song in the world It was the best song in the world Look into my eyes and it's easy to see One and one make two, two and one make three It was destiny Once every hundred-thousand years or so When the sun doth shine, and the moon doth glow And the grass doth grow Needless to say The beast was stunned A-whip-crack went his whippy tail! And the beast was done He asked us" Be you angels?" And we said " Nay We are but men" Rock! Ah, ah, ah Ho, whoa, oh-yo! This is not the greatest song in the world, no This is just a tribute!
