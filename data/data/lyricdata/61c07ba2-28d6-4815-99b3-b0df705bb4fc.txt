Gave up trying to figure it out But my head got lost along the way Worn out from giving it up But my soul, I pissed it all away Still stings these shattered nerves Pigs, we get what pigs deserve I'm going all the way down I'm leaving today Come, come, come on, you've gotta fill me up Come, come, gotta let me inside of you Come, come, come on, you've gotta fix me up Come, come, gotta let me get inside you Still feel it all slipping away But it doesn't matter anymore Everybody's still slipping away But it doesn't matter anymore Look through these blackened eyes You'll see ten thousand lies My lips may promise But my heart is a whore Come, come, come on, you've gotta fix me up Come, come, gotta let me inside of you Come, come, come on, you've gotta fill me up Come, come, gotta let me get through to you This isn't meant to last This is for right now This isn't meant to last This is for right now This isn't meant to last This is for right now This isn't meant to last This is for right I know it's all getting away And it comes to me as no surprise I know what's coming to me Is never going to arrive Fresh blood through tired skin New sweat to drown me in Dress up this rotten carcass Just to make it look alive Come, come, come on, you've gotta fill me up Come, come, gotta let me inside of you Come, come, come on, you've gotta fix me up Come, come, gotta let me inside of you This isn't meant to last This is for right now This isn't meant to last This is for right now This isn't meant to last This is for right now This isn't meant to last This is for right now This isn't meant to last This is for right now This isn't meant to last This is for right now This isn't meant to last This is for right now This isn't meant to last This is for right I want you to make me I want you to take me I want you to break me I want you to throw me away
