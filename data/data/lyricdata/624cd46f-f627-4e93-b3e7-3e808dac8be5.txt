Won't you walk me through the TiergartenWon't you walk me through it all, darlingDoesn't matter if it is rainin'Won't you walk me through it allEven if the sun it is blazin'Even if the snow it is ragin'All the elements we must conquerTo get to the other side of townI have suffered shipwreck against your dark brown eyesI have run aground against your broken-down smilesBelieve me when I tell you I have no place to goBut to go where the wildflowers grow and the stone gardens bloom(And the stone gardens bloom)Won't you walk me through the TiergartenWon't you walk me through it all, darlingDoesn't matter if it is rainingWe'll get to the other side of town
