(World so cold)Maybe I'm just too demandingMaybe I'm just like my father, too boldMaybe you're just like my motherShe's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)Why do we scream at each other?This is what it sounds like when doves cryHow can you just leave me standingAlone in a world that's so cold? (World is so cold)Maybe I'm just too demanding (Maybe, maybe)Maybe I'm just like my father, too bold (I'm like my father, you know, you know he's too bold)Maybe you're just like my mother (Maybe you're just like my mother)She's never satisfied (Never, never satisfied)Why do we scream at each other? (Why do we scream, why?)This is what it sounds like when doves cryWhen doves cry, when doves cry, when doves cryWhen doves cry, when doves cry, when doves cry
