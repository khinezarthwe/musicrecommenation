I've never told this story to another living soulFor fear it might awaken and the story would unfoldCandles in a courtyard and a paper colored catWhile demos danced on feathers and cosmos held the hatNext came their profession and a paper colored purrAn umber armed albino and the crowd began to stirI slid behind a linden to swallow what I'd seenI slid behind a linden and to swallow what I'd seenThreads of grass and thumbles, needles made of hairLeaves a dance that stumbles, limbs laughed in the airThreads of grass and thumbles, needles made of hairLeaves a dance that stumbles, limbs laughed in the airAnd on the day you fall, whose name would you callThe only thing you taught me is the only thing you knowHow to start a fire once the umbers cease to glowThe only thing you taught me is the only thing you knowHow to start a fire once the umbers cease to glow
