I've never told this story to another living soul For fear it might awaken and the story would unfold Candles in a courtyard and a paper colored cat While demos danced on feathers and cosmos held the hat Next came their profession and a paper colored purr An umber armed albino and the crowd began to stir I slid behind a linden to swallow what I'd seen I slid behind a linden and to swallow what I'd seen Threads of grass and thumbles, needles made of hair Leaves a dance that stumbles, limbs laughed in the air Threads of grass and thumbles, needles made of hair Leaves a dance that stumbles, limbs laughed in the air And on the day you fall, whose name would you call The only thing you taught me is the only thing you know How to start a fire once the umbers cease to glow The only thing you taught me is the only thing you know How to start a fire once the umbers cease to glow
