Look at me I'm fallingOff a cliff nowI can still hear my mama yelling no no noBut the words mean nothingCan't catch up to me nowAnd the view is so beautifulAll the way downWhen I was a little boySucking juice from a bottleBelieveing my perceptions were oh so realBut I didn't know nothingStill know nothingWas just enough for me to know the way I feelThis is lifeWhat a fucked up thing we doWhat a nightmare come trueOr a playground if we chooseAnd I chooseLook at me I'm swollenLike a bananafish nowI'm never gonna make it out of my holeBut I keep on laughingDoesn't really matterThere's dozens of reasons for explaining my soulWhen I was a teenagerSuckin' booze with the vatosDiscussing who was gonna live to be 21They said they wouldn't make itThey didn't make itWe're all naked when the day is said and doneThis is lifeWhat a fucked up thing we doWhat a nightmare come trueOr a playground if we chooseAnd I chooseDon't know who made this all come trueBut know while you're hereYou just gotta do what you gotta doNow if I wasn't such a weenieDo you think you'd still love mePretending I'm an airplane on the living room floorBut like a lovely generatorYou stand right by meAnd if words were wisdom I'd be talking even moreSo I keep on fallingAs I'm looking back above meWatching as my mama just becomes a little dotNow I'm like DeniroI'm amarilloAnd I'll never know when I hit the groundThis is lifeWhat a fucked up thing we doWhat a nightmare come trueOr a playground if we chooseAnd I choose
