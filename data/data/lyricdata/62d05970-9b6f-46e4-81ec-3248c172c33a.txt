This has got to dieI said this has got to stopThis has got to lie downWith someone else on topYou can keep me pinned'Cause it's easier to teaseBut you can't paint an elephantQuite as good as sheAnd she may cry like a babyAnd she may drive me crazy'Cause I am lately lonelySo why'd you have to lie?I take it I'm your crutchThe pillow in your pillow caseIs easier to touchAnd when you think you've sinnedDo you fall upon your knees?Or do you sit within your picture?Do you still forget the breeze?And she may rise, if I sing you downAnd she may wisely cling to the ground'Cause I am lately hornySo why would she take me thorny?What's the point of this song? Or even singing?You've already gone, why am I clinging?Well I could throw her out, and I could live withoutAnd I could do it all for youI could be trueTell me if you want me to lie'Cause this has got to dieI said this has got to stopThis has got to lie down, downWith someone else on topYou can both keep me pinned'Cause it's easier to teaseBut you can't make me happyQuite as good as meWell you know that's a lie
