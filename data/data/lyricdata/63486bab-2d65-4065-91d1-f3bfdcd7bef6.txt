How does it feelTo treat me like you doWhen you've your hands upon meAnd told me who you areI thought I was mistakenI thought I heard your wordsTell me how do I feelTell me now how do I feelThose who came before meLived through their vocationsFrom the past until completionThey'll turn away no moreAnd I still find it so hardTo say what I need to sayBut I'm quite sure that you'll tell meJust how I should feel todayI see a ship in the harborI can and shall obeyBut if it wasn't for your misfortuneI'd be a heavenly person todayAnd I thought I was mistakenI thought I heard you speakTell me how do I feelTell me now, how should I feelI thought I told you to leave meWhile I walked down to the beachTell me how does it feelWhen your heart grows coldWhen your heart grows coldWhen your heart grows cold
