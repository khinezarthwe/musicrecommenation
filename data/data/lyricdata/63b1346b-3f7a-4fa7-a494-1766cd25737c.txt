I was born under a bad signLeft out in the coldI'm a lonely man who knowsJust what it means to lose controlBut I took all the heartacheAnd turned it into shameNow I'm moving, moving onAnd I ain't taking the blameDon't come running to meI know I've done all I canA hard loving woman like youJust makes a hard loving manSo I can say it to you, babeI'll be a fool for your loving no moreA fool for your loving no moreI'm so tired of tryingI always end up cryingA fool for your loving no moreI'll be a fool for your loving no moreI'm tired of hiding my feelingsYou left me lonely too longI gave my heart and you tore it apartOh baby, you done me wrongDon't come running to meI know I've done all I canA hard loving woman like youJust makes a hard loving manSo I can say it to you babyI'll be a fool for your loving no moreFool for your loving no moreI'm so tired of tryingI always end up cryingA fool for your loving no moreI'll be a fool for your loving no moreI'll be a fool for your loving no more, no more, no moreSo I can say it to you babyI'll be a fool for your loving no moreFool for your loving no moreI'm so tired of tryingI always end up cryingFool for your loving no moreA fool for your loving no moreNo more, no moreFool for your loving no moreFool for your loving no moreFool for your loving no moreFool for your loving no moreFool for your loving no moreA fool for your loving no more
