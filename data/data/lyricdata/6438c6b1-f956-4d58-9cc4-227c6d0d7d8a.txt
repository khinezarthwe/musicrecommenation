You consider me the young apprenticeCaught between the Scylla and CharybdisHypnotized by you if I should lingerStaring at the ring around your fingerI have only come here seeking knowledgeThings they would not teach me of in collegeI can see the destiny you soldTurned into a shining band of goldI'll be wrapped around your fingerI'll be wrapped around your fingerMephistopheles is not your nameI know what you're up to just the sameI will listen hard to your tuitionYou will see it come to its fruitionI'll be wrapped around your fingerI'll be wrapped around your fingerDevil and the deep blue sea behind meVanish in the air, you'll never find meI will turn your face to alabasterWhen you find your servant is your masterYou'll be wrapped around my fingerYou'll be wrapped around my fingerYou'll be wrapped around my finger
