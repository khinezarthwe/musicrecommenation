Bike downDown to the downtownDown to the lockdownBoards, nails lie aroundI crouch like a crowContrasting the snowFor the agony, I'd rather knowCause blindedI am blindsidedPeek inInto the peer inI'm not really like thisI'm probably plight-lessI cup the windowI'm crippled and slowFor the agony, I'd rather knowCause blindedI am blindsidedWould you really rush out?Would you really rush out?Would you really rush out for me now?Would you really rush out?Would you really rush out for me now?Would you really rush out for me now?Would you really rush out for me now?Would you really rush out?For me now?For me now?For me now?Taught lineDown to the shorelineThe end of a blood lineThe moon is a cold lightThere's a pull to the flowMy feet melt the snowFor the irony, I'd rather knowCause blindedI was blindsidedBlindedI was blindsidedCause blindedI was blindsided
