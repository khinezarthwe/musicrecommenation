In an open field at duskTo footfalls I awokeMarching ants across my temples, ohTheir feet had no intentionThey followed some magnetic drumPrisoners of their destinationFrom the slats of the factory comeWhere once they did make railsOld Death's peculiar songsHe didn't know I was listeningSo he crowed out nice and longTo the spiders and the lumber and the dustOf his conquests and his hunger, and his lustI heard his feet rejoiceI heard him tap his caneAs if he had his own reviewOnstage at the AthenaeumI caught his words in my open mouthI gagged and choked and spit them outI heard him turn as he did hearMy tiny heartbeat in his earI was already runningOh I heard him comingShrapnel spitting from his wheelsHis scything arms rake for my heelsI dove and rolled and hid my faceAnd I said these magic words"My dove is home, her breast is warm, my dove is home."I said these magic words andFell down, down, the anthillFor days"My dove is home, her breast is warm, my dove is home.""My dove is home, her breast is warm, my dove is home".
