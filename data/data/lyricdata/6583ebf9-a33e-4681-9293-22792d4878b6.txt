I met the smiling face of loveShe's in my mind alwaysThrough the hero she put intoMy lifeShe kisses all my daysI used to see a twisted faceThe only one I knewI kissed the burning lips of lustIt's all I knew to doThis is my loveThis is my loveHow I wished for herGood fortuneI tried so hard to seeI listened to the night time breezeBut she is quiet as can beIn all the searching we doTo find love's gentle beingIf we open more than just our eyesWe might know whatWe're seeing[Repeat: x4]This is my loveI met the smiling face of loveShe's in my mind alwaysThrough the hero she put intoMy lifeShe kisses all my daysI used to see a twisted faceThe only one I knewI kissed the burning lips of lustIt's all I knew to do[Repeat: x4]This is my love
