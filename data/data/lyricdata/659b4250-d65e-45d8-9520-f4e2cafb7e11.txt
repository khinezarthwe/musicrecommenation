I'm a rabbit in your headlightsScared of the spotlightYou don't come to visitI'm stuck in this bedThin rubber glovesShe laughs when she's cryingShe cries when she's laughingFat bloody fingers are sucking your soul awayI'm a rabbit in your headlightsChristian suburbaniteWashed down the toiletMoney to burnFat bloody fingers are sucking your soul awayWhite worms on the undergroundCaught between stationsButter fingersI'm losing my patienceI'm a rabbit in your headlightsChristian suburbaniteYou got money to burnFat bloody fingers are sucking your soul awayAway
