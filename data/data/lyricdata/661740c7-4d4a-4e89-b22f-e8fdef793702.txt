A friend of mine grows his very own bramblesThey twist all around him till he can't moveBeautiful, quivering, chivalrous shamblesWhat is my friend trying to prove?The booze turns a tall, gentle boy to a terrible totemAnd the kids gather 'round trying to see what's insideI think when he's drinking he's drowning some riotWhat is my friend trying to hide?'Cause it's breaking my heart, it's breaking my heartAnd it's breaking my heart to pour like the rainBrother of mine don't run with those fuckersWhen will my friend start singing again?When will my friend start singing again?
