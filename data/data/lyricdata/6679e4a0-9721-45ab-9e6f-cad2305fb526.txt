Well I think I see another sideMaybe just another light that shinesAnd I look over now through the doorAnd I still belong to no one elseMaybe I hold you to blame for all the reasonsThat you left.And close my eyes, still I see your surpriseAnd you're leaving before my time.Baby won't you change your mind?Surely don't stay long I'm missing you now.It's like I told you I'm over you somehowBefore I close the door INeed to hear you say goodbye.Baby won't you change your mind?I guess that hasn't changed someoneMaybe nobody else could understandI guess that you believe you are a womanAnd that I am someone else's manBut just before I see that you leaveI want you to hold on to things that you saidBaby I wish I was dead.Surely don't stay long I'm missing you now.It's like I told you I'm over you somehowBefore I close the door INeed to hear you say goodbyeBaby won't you change your mind?
