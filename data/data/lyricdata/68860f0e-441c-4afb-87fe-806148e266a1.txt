I always felt so far from youLike something wasn't rightBut tonightI rest my head inside the crook of your armAnd I feel like a golden starExploding(Tonight we are fullTonight we rejoice)Exploding(You are my golden star)ExplodingOne, twoThough everything has come undoneThe distance between us closesAnd everything is suddenlyExploding(Tonight we are fullTonight we rejoice)Exploding(You are my golden star)ExplodeTonight we are full upIn spite we rejoiceTonight we are full upIn spite we rejoice like starsExploding...Exploding...Exploding...Exploding...
