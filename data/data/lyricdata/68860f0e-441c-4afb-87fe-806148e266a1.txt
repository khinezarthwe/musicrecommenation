I always felt so far from you Like something wasn't right But tonight I rest my head inside the crook of your arm And I feel like a golden star Exploding( Tonight we are full Tonight we rejoice) Exploding( You are my golden star) Exploding One, two Though everything has come undone The distance between us closes And everything is suddenly Exploding( Tonight we are full Tonight we rejoice) Exploding( You are my golden star) Explode Tonight we are full up In spite we rejoice Tonight we are full up In spite we rejoice like stars Exploding... Exploding... Exploding... Exploding...
