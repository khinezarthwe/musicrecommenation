On a cold winter morning, in a time before the lightIn flames of death's eternal reign we ride towards the fightWhen the darkness has fallen down and the times are tough alrightThe sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonightFighting hard, fighting on for the steel through the wastelands evermoreThe scattered souls will feel the hell bodies wasted on the shoresOn the blackest plains in hell's domain we watch them as they goIn fire and pain now once again we knowSo now we fly, yeah, we're free, we're free before the thunderstormOn towards the wilderness our quest carries onFar beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlightDeep inside our hearts and all our soulsSo far away we wait for the dayFor the lives all so wasted and goneWe feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand daysThrough the fire and the flames we carry onAs the red day is dawning and the lightning cracks the skyThey'll raise their hands to the heavens above with resentment in their eyesRunning back through the mid-morning light there's a burning in my heartWe're banished from a time in a fallen land to a life beyond the starsIn your darkest dreams see to believe our destiny is timeAnd endlessly we'll all be free tonightAnd on the wings of a dream so far beyond realityAll alone in desperation now the time is goneLost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mindDay after day this misery must go onSo far away we wait for the dayFor the lives all so wasted and goneWe feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand daysThrough the fire and the flames we carry onNow here we stand with their blood on our handsWe fought so hard now, can we understand?I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly canFor freedom of every manSo far away we wait for the dayFor the lives all so wasted and goneWe feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand daysThrough the fire and the flames we carry on
