My immaculate dream made of breath and skin I've been waiting for you Signed with a home tattoo" Happy birthday to you" was created for you( Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams)( Cannot believe you're taking my heart to pieces) Oh, it'll take a little time Might take a little crime to come undone now We'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside Hey child, stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry Who do you need, who do you love When you come undone? Who do you need, who do you love When you come undone? Words, playing me deja vu Like a radio tune I swear I've heard before Chill, is it something real Or the magic I'm feeling off your fingers?( Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams)( Cannot believe you're taking my heart to pieces) Lost, in a snow filled sky, we'll make it all right To come undone now We'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside Hey child, stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry Who do you need, who do you love When you come undone? Who do you need, who do you love When you come undone?( Can't ever keep from falling apart) Who do you need, who do you love When you come undone?( Can't ever keep from falling apart) Who do you need, who do you love Who do you need, who do you love When you come undone?( Can't ever keep from falling apart)
