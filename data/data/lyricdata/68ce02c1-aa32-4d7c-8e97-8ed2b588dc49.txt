My immaculate dream made of breath and skinI've been waiting for youSigned with a home tattoo"Happy birthday to you" was created for you(Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams)(Cannot believe you're taking my heart to pieces)Oh, it'll take a little timeMight take a little crime to come undone nowWe'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outsideHey child, stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cryWho do you need, who do you loveWhen you come undone?Who do you need, who do you loveWhen you come undone?Words, playing me deja vuLike a radio tune I swear I've heard beforeChill, is it something realOr the magic I'm feeling off your fingers?(Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams)(Cannot believe you're taking my heart to pieces)Lost, in a snow filled sky, we'll make it all rightTo come undone nowWe'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outsideHey child, stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cryWho do you need, who do you loveWhen you come undone?Who do you need, who do you loveWhen you come undone?(Can't ever keep from falling apart)Who do you need, who do you loveWhen you come undone?(Can't ever keep from falling apart)Who do you need, who do you loveWho do you need, who do you loveWhen you come undone?(Can't ever keep from falling apart)
