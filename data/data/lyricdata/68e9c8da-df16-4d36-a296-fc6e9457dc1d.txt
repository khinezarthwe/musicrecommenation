Whatsoever I've feared has come to lifeWhatsoever I've fought off became my lifeJust when every day seemed to greet me with a smileSunspots have faded and now I'm doing timeNow I'm doing time'Cause I fell on black daysI fell on black daysWhomsoever I've cured, I've sickened nowWhomsoever I've cradled, I've put you downI'm a search light soul, they say, but I can't see it in the nightI'm only faking when I get it rightWhen I get it right'Cause I fell on black daysI fell on black daysHow would I know that this could be my fate?How would I know that this could be my fate?So what you wanted to see good has made you blindAnd what you wanted to be yours, has made it mineSo don't you lock up something that you wanted to see flyHands are for shaking, no, not tyingNo, not tyingI sure don't mind a changeI sure don't mind a changeYeah, I sure don't mindI sure don't mind a changeI sure don't mind a changeBut I fell on black daysI fell on black daysHow would I know that this could be my fate?How would I know that this could be my fate?How would I know that this could be my fate?How would I know that this could be my fate?I sure don't mind a change
