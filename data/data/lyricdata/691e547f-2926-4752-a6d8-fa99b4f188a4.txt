I've seen your eyes as they fix on meWhat is he doing? What on earth's the plan? Has he got one?You'd better give me some pointersSince you are the big rocket launcher and I'm just the shotgunWell, I ain't got no dollar signs in my eyesThat might be a surprise but it's trueSo I'm not like you and I don't want your advice or your praiseOr to move in the ways you do and I never will'Cause all you people are vampiresAnd all your stories are staleAnd though you pretend to stand by usI know you're certain we'll failWell, I've seen your eyes as they fix on meFull of confusion, your snarl is just so condescendingTry to explain that we're onto a winIf the feel we get in near recoups what we're spendingHe says, "I can't believe that you drove all that way"Well, how much did they pay you? How much did they pay you?You'd have been better to stay 'round our wayThinking 'bout things but not actually doing the things'Cause all you people are vampiresAnd all your stories are staleAnd though you pretend to stand by usI know you're certain we'll fail'Cause all you people are vampiresAnd all your stories are staleAnd though you pretend to stand by usI know you're certain we'll failAll you people are vampires
