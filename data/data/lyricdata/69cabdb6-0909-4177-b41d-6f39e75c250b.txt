I was happy in the haze of a drunken hourBut heaven knows I'm miserable nowI was looking for a job and then I found a jobAnd heaven knows I'm miserable nowIn my lifeWhy do I give valuable timeTo people who don't care if I live or I die?Two lovers entwined pass me byAnd heaven knows I'm miserable nowI was looking for a job and then I found a jobAnd heaven knows I'm miserable nowIn my lifeWhy do I give valuable timeTo people who don't care if I live or I die?What she asked of me at the end of the dayCaligula would have blushed"Oh you've been in the house too long", she saidAnd I naturally fledIn my lifeWhy do I smileAt people who I'd much rather kick in the eye?I was happy in the haze of a drunken hourBut heaven knows I'm miserable now"Oh you've been in the house too long", she saidAnd I naturally fledIn my lifeWhy do I give valuable timeTo people who don't care if I live or I die?
