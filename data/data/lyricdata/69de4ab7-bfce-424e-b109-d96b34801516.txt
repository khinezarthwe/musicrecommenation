Flying on a free flightDriving all night with my machinery'Cause II got the power any hourTo show the man in meI got reputations blown to pieces with my artilleryWell I'll be guiding and we'll be ridingGiving what you got to meDon't you struggleDon't you fightDon't you worry 'cause it's your turn tonightLet me put my love into you babeLet me put my love on the lineLet me put my love into you babeLet me cut your cake with my knifeLike a fever burning fasterYou spark the fire in meCrazy feelings got me reelingThey got me raising steamNow don't you struggleDon't you fightDon't you worry 'cause it's your turn tonight, yeahLet me put my love into you babeLet me put my love on the lineLet me put my love into you babeLet me cut your cake with my knifeLet me, let meLet me put my love into you babeLet me put my love on the lineLet me put my love into you babeLet me cut your cake with my knifeLet me put my love into you babeLet me put my love on the lineLet me put my love into you babeLet me give it allLet me give it allTo youTo youGive it all
