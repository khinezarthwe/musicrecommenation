I'm thinking of youIn my sleepThey're not good thoughtsThe worst kind of sadI've noticed thingsCannot be repairedWhen I wake upI'll be in despair'Cause I know I've got to sayI know I've got to sayGoodbyeBaby goodbyeGoodbyeBaby goodbyeYou're my sweetheartGoodbyeYou're my sweetestGoodbyeI know I'm gonna lookSo so so so badBut there's no easier wayFor me to have to walk awayBut I don't want to hear this no moreAnd I don't want to feel this no moreAnd I don't want to see this no moreAnd I don't want to experience this no more'Cause I know I've got to sayI know I've got to sayGoodbyeBaby goodbyeGoodbyeBaby goodbyeYou're my sweetheartGoodbyeYou're my sweetestGoodbyeGoodbyeGoodbyeGoodbye (You're my sweetest)...
