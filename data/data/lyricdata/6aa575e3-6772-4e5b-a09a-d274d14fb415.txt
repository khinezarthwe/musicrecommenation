I've been alone with you inside my mindAnd in my dreams, I've kissed your lips a thousand timesI sometimes see you pass outside my doorHello, is it me you're looking for?I can see it in your eyesI can see it in your smileYou're all I've ever wantedAnd my arms are open wide'Cause you know just what to sayAnd you know just what to doAnd I want to tell you so muchI love youI long to see the sunlight in your hairAnd tell you time and time again how much I careSometimes I feel my heart will overflowHello, I've just got to let you know'Cause I wonder where you areAnd I wonder what you doAre you somewhere feeling lonelyOr is someone loving you?Tell me how to win your heartFor I haven't got a clueBut let me start by sayingI love youHello, is it me you're looking for?But I wonder where you areAnd I wonder what you doAre you somewhere feeling lonelyIs someone loving you?Tell me how to win your heartFor I haven't got a clueBut let me start by sayingI love you
