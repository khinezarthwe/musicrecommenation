Home in the valleyHome in the cityHome isn't prettyAin't no home for meHome in the darknessHome on the highwayHome isn't my wayHome I'll never beBurn out the dayBurn out the nightI can't see no reason to put up a fightI'm livin' for givin' the devil his dueAnd I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for youI'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for youTime is the essenceTime is the seasonTime ain't no reasonGot no time to slowTime everlastingTime to play B-sidesTime ain't on my sideTime I'll never knowBurn out the dayBurn out the nightI'm not the one to tell you what's wrong or what's rightI've seen suns that were freezing and lives that were throughBut I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for youI'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for youBurn out the dayBurn out the nightI can't see no reason to put up a fightI'm livin' for givin' the devil his dueAnd I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for youI'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for youI'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for youI'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' for youOh
