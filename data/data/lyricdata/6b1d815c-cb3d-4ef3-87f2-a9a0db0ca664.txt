I find myself inside a church deserted by the priestsAs shadows shift from grey to red, I notice there's no floorTransparent air suspends my weight as if I had no massSuddenly the moon comes out from the clouded skiesWet and cold from shifting daydreams, wakeful in the sleepWindowpane observing some commotion down belowWaiting for the noise to come to blur the weary mindWatching as a pastime and I'm the fallen starGo film - we can all be godsGo film - we will all be heroesGo film - we are all immortalGo film - we will all be safeGo film - we are all illusionsGo film - and we can never touchI will shine again with burning light when I returnIn and out from foreign shores, I've gone astray in timeBorn to search for something I have never ever seenOn an endless quest to hostile ground and unknown landsThen the scene go back to where it started and I fallAs shadows shift from red to grey, I notice there's no floorAnd gravity awakes me as it throws me to the groundA million tiny grains of dust obscures me from your eyes
