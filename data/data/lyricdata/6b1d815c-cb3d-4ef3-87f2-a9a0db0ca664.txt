I find myself inside a church deserted by the priests As shadows shift from grey to red, I notice there's no floor Transparent air suspends my weight as if I had no mass Suddenly the moon comes out from the clouded skies Wet and cold from shifting daydreams, wakeful in the sleep Windowpane observing some commotion down below Waiting for the noise to come to blur the weary mind Watching as a pastime and I'm the fallen star Go film - we can all be gods Go film - we will all be heroes Go film - we are all immortal Go film - we will all be safe Go film - we are all illusions Go film - and we can never touch I will shine again with burning light when I return In and out from foreign shores, I've gone astray in time Born to search for something I have never ever seen On an endless quest to hostile ground and unknown lands Then the scene go back to where it started and I fall As shadows shift from red to grey, I notice there's no floor And gravity awakes me as it throws me to the ground A million tiny grains of dust obscures me from your eyes
