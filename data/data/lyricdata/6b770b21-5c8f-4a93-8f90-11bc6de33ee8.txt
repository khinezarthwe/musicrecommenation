Ohh...Can anybody see the lightWhere the morn meets the dewAnd the tide risesDid you realise no one can see inside your view?Did you realise for why this sight belongs to you?Ohh...Just set aside your fears of lifeWith the sole desireDone it warningDone in nowThis ain't realOn in this sideDone it warningDone in nowThis ain't realOn in this sideDone it warningDone in nowThis ain't realDone it warningDone in nowThis ain't realOn in this sideOhh...Oh can anybody see the lightWhere the morn meets the dewAnd the tide risesDid you realise no one can see inside your view?Did you realise, for why this sight belongs to you?
