I hear the sound of falling loveAs I wonder where you areHits the ground with a dead soundKnow you ain't got farYou're too stupid and sissy-likeTo say that you want outYou make the eyes of a million girlsAnd think you'll make them shoutDead soundDead soundDead soundDead soundI used to take you on every timeThat sparkle turned to blackI used to drag you through my streetsWhen you came crawling backYour cheap words that you bought on saleWon't help you through tonightYou make the eyes of a million girlsAnd think that's what they likeDead soundDead soundDead soundDead soundAnd now you go through a million girlsAnd try to pick what's rightWhen nightfall comes and you're still aloneDo you feel it deep inside?It's oh-so-cold on the other sideWhere thoughts can turn you downYou make the eyes of a million girlsBut I see no girl aroundDead soundDead soundDead soundDead sound
