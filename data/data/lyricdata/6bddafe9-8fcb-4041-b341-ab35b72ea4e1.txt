Simply knowing you exist ain't good enough for meBut asking for your telephone number seems highly inappropriateSeeing as I can'tEven say hiWhen you walk byAnd that time you shook my hand it felt so niceI swear I never felt this way about any other guyAnd I don't usually notice people's eyes but...I conducted a plan to bump into you most accidentallyBut I was walking along and I bumped into youMuch more heavily than I'd originally plannedIt was well embarrassing and I think you thought that I was a bit of a twatI just think that we'd get onOh I wish I could tell you face to faceInstead of singing this stupid songBut yeah I just think that we might get onSo I went to that partyEveryone, they were kind of artyAnd I was wearing this dressCos I wanted to impressBut I wasn't sure if I looked my bestCos I was so nervousBut I carried on regardlessStrutting through each room trying to find youAnd then I saw you kissing that girlMy heart, it shatteredAnd my eyes, they wateredAnd when I tried to speak, I stutteredAnd my friends were like, "whatever,You'll find someone betterHis eyes are way too close togetherAnd we never even liked him from the startAnd now he's with that tartAnd I heard she done some really nasty stuff down in the parkWith MichaelHe said she's easyAnd if your guy's with someone that's sleazyThen he ain't worth your timeCos you deserve a real nice guy"So I proceeded to get drunkAnd to cryI locked myself in the toilet for the entire nightSaturday night, I watched Channel 5I particularly like CSII don't ever dream about you and meI don't ever make up stuff about usThat would be classed as insanityI don't ever drive by your houseTo see if you're inI don't even have an opinionOn that tramp that you are still seeingI don't know your timetableI don't know your face off by heartBut I must admit that there is stillA part of me that thinksWe might get onThat we could get onThat we should get on
