Simply knowing you exist ain't good enough for me But asking for your telephone number seems highly inappropriate Seeing as I can't Even say hi When you walk by And that time you shook my hand it felt so nice I swear I never felt this way about any other guy And I don't usually notice people's eyes but... I conducted a plan to bump into you most accidentally But I was walking along and I bumped into you Much more heavily than I'd originally planned It was well embarrassing and I think you thought that I was a bit of a twat I just think that we'd get on Oh I wish I could tell you face to face Instead of singing this stupid song But yeah I just think that we might get on So I went to that party Everyone, they were kind of arty And I was wearing this dress Cos I wanted to impress But I wasn't sure if I looked my best Cos I was so nervous But I carried on regardless Strutting through each room trying to find you And then I saw you kissing that girl My heart, it shattered And my eyes, they watered And when I tried to speak, I stuttered And my friends were like, "whatever, You'll find someone better His eyes are way too close together And we never even liked him from the start And now he's with that tart And I heard she done some really nasty stuff down in the park With Michael He said she's easy And if your guy's with someone that's sleazy Then he ain't worth your time Cos you deserve a real nice guy" So I proceeded to get drunk And to cry I locked myself in the toilet for the entire night Saturday night, I watched Channel 5 I particularly like C S I I don't ever dream about you and me I don't ever make up stuff about us That would be classed as insanity I don't ever drive by your house To see if you're in I don't even have an opinion On that tramp that you are still seeing I don't know your timetable I don't know your face off by heart But I must admit that there is still A part of me that thinks We might get on That we could get on That we should get on
