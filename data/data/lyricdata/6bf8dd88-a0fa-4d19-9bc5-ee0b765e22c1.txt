Yes indeed I'm, alone again And here comes emptiness, crashing in Its either love or hate, I can't find in between' Cause I've been with witches and I've been with the queen It wouldn't have worked out anyway So now it's just another lonely dayhey, hey Further along, we just may But for now it's just another lonely day Wish there was something I, could say or do I can resist anything but, the temptation from you But I'd rather walk alone, than chase you around I'd rather fall myself than let you, drag me on down It wouldn't have worked out anywayand now it's just another lonely dayhey, hey Further along, we just may But for now it's just another lonely day Yesterday seems like a, life ago' Cause the one I loved today, I hardly know You I held so close, in my heart oh dear Grow further from me with every, falling tear It wouldn't have worked out anyway So now it's just another lonely dayhey, hey Further along, we just may But for now it's just another lonely day For now its just another lonely dayhey, hey For now its just another lonely day
