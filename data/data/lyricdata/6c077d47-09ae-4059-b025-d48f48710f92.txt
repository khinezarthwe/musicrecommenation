The glove compartment is inaccurately namedAnd everybody knows itSo I'm proposing a swift, orderly changeCause behind its door, there's nothing to keep my fingers warmAnd all I find are souvenirs from better timesBefore the gleam of your taillights fading eastTo find yourself a better lifeI was searching for some legal documentAs the rain beat down on the hoodWhen I stumbled upon pictures I tried to forgetAnd that's how this idea was drilled into my head'Cause it's too important to stay the way it's beenThere's no blame for how our love did slowly fadeAnd now that it's gone, it's like it wasn't there at allAnd here I rest, where disappointment and regret collideLying awake at nightAnd there's no blame for how our love did slowly fadeAnd now that it's gone it's like it wasn't there at allAnd here I rest, where disappointment and regret collideLying awake at night, all nightWhen I'm lying awake at night
