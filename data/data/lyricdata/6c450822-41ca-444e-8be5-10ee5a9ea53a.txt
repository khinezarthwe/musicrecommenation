Rosemary Heaven restores you in life You're coming with me Through the aging, the fearing, the strife It's the smiling on the package, it's the faces in the sand It's the thought that moves you upwards, embracing me with two hands Right will take you places, yeah maybe to the beach When your friends they do come crying, tell them now your pleasure's set upon slow-release Hey wait Great smile Sensitive to fate, not denial But hey, who's on trial? It took a lifespan with no cellmate, the long way back Sandy, why can't we look the other way? He speaks about travel, yeah, we think about the land We smart like all peoples feeling real tan I could take you places, do you need a new man? Wipe the pollen from the faces make revision to a dream while you wait in the van Hey wait Great smile Sensitive to fate, not denial But hey, who's on trial? It took a lifespan with no cellmate to find a long way back Sandy, why can't we look the other way? You're weightless, you are exotic You need something for which to care Sandy, why can't we look the other way? Leave some shards under the belly, lay some grease inside my hand It's a sentimental jury and the makings of a good plan You've come to love me lightly, yeah you've come to hold me tight Is this motion everlasting or do shudders pass in the night? Rosemary Oh, heaven restores you in life I spent a lifespan with no cellmate, the long way back Sandy, why can't we look the other way? You're weightless, semi-erotic You need someone to take you there Sandy, why can't we look the other way? Why can't we just play the other game? Why can't we just look the other way?
