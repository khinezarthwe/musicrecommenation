Take leave in conscious mindFound myself to be so inclinedWhy sleep in discontentFor the price of companionshipMy shadow runs with meUnderneath the big white sunMy shadow comes with me as we leave it allWe leave it all far behindAh, empty pockets willAllow a greater sense of wealthWhy contain yourself like any other book on a shelfMy shadow lays with meUnderneath the big white sunMy shadow stays with me as we leave it allWe leave it all far behind...Subtle voices in the wind,And the truth they're tellingThe world begins where the road endsWatch me leave it all behindFar behindFar behind
