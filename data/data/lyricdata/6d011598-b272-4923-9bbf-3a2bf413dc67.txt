The trophy that I made for usIn fur and goldGot into the wrong pair of handsAnd truth was soldThey bought it for, oh, so much lessThan it was worthAnd every man that touched itFound a heaven on earthHeaven is a feeling I get in your armsHeaven is a feeling I get in your armsHeaven is a feeling I get in your armsHeaven is a feeling I get in your armsThe queens and the court jestersClapped, adoredTheir hearts swelled to overdriveAnd mercy soaredMercy this and mercy thatLet justice prevailBut I just want my trophy backIt's not for saleCreatures of mercyShoot, shootShoot them downAnd set me freeWhen I got my trophy backIt took some timeTo polish it to gold from blackAnd shoot the lionAnd when I put it back insideAnd locked the doorA trophy of mercyIs a trophy no more
