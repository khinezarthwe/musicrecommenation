Stranded in the spooky townStoplights are swaying and the phone lines are downThe floor is crackling coldShe took my heart, I think she took my soulWith the moon I runFar from the carnage of the fiery sunDriven by the strangle of veinShowing no mercy, I'd do it againOpen up your eyeYou keep on crying, baby, I'll bleed you dryThe skies, they blink at meI see a storm bubbling up from the seaNow it's coming closerNow it's coming closerYou shimmy shook my boneLeaving me stranded, all in love on my ownDo you think of me?Where am I now, baby, where do I sleep?Feels so good, but I'm oldTwo thousand years of chasing, taking its tollNow it's coming closerNow it's coming closerNow it's coming closerNow it's coming closer
