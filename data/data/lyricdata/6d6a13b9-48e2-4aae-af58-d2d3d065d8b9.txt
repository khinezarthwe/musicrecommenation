I'm not calming downWhat's this all about?All I know is I don't need this tone you're takingForget what I saidFor every promise keptThere's a thousand I don't even know I'm makingSo it's time to stop being so impatientIt's time to stop being so impatientYour philosophyIs totally lost on meWith a promise I don't mean to have you waitingThat attitudeWon't do any goodWhen the problem's only as you, as you've made itSo it's time to stop being so impatientIt's time to stop being so impatientWhy not try to take it down?You're gonna have to wait this outOr tell me nowWhere the fuckin' fire isYour philosophyIs wholly lost on meWell I promise I don't mean to have you waitingAnd that attitudeWon't do any goodWhen the problem's only as you, as you've made itSo it's time that you stop being so impatientWell it's time that you stop being so impatientYou're so impatientYou're so impatientYou're so impatient
