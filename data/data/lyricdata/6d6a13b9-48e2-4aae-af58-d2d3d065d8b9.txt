I'm not calming down What's this all about? All I know is I don't need this tone you're taking Forget what I said For every promise kept There's a thousand I don't even know I'm making So it's time to stop being so impatient It's time to stop being so impatient Your philosophy Is totally lost on me With a promise I don't mean to have you waiting That attitude Won't do any good When the problem's only as you, as you've made it So it's time to stop being so impatient It's time to stop being so impatient Why not try to take it down? You're gonna have to wait this out Or tell me now Where the fuckin' fire is Your philosophy Is wholly lost on me Well I promise I don't mean to have you waiting And that attitude Won't do any good When the problem's only as you, as you've made it So it's time that you stop being so impatient Well it's time that you stop being so impatient You're so impatient You're so impatient You're so impatient
