Rose-tinted viewAnd satellites that compromise the truthBut I wanted more, with the cuts and the bruisesTouch my face, a hopeless embraceFaithDrives me awayBut it turns me onLike a strangers loveIt rockets through the universeIt fuels the lies, it feeds the curseBelieves we could beGloriousI need to believeBut I still want more, with the cuts and the bruisesDon't close the door, on what you adoreFaithDrives me awayBut it turns me onLike a strangers loveIt rockets through the universeIt fuels the lies, it feeds the curseBelieves we could beGlorious
