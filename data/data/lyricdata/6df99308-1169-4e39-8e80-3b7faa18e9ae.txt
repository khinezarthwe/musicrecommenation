Why do I have to fly over every town up and down the line? I'll die in the clouds above and you that I defend I do not love I wake up, it's a bad dream, no one on my side I was fighting, but I just feel too tired to be fighting Guess I'm not the fighting kind Where will I meet my fate? Baby, I'm a man I was born to hate And when will I meet my end? In a better time you could be my friend I wake up, it's a bad dream, no one on my side I was fighting, but I just feel too tired to be fighting Guess I'm not the fighting kind Wouldn't mind it if you were by my side But you're long gone, yeah you're long gone now Yeah Where do we go? I don't even know my strange old face And I'm thinking about those days And I'm thinking about those days I wake up, it's a bad dream, no one on my side I was fighting, but I just feel too tired to be fighting Guess I'm not the fighting kind Wouldn't mind it if you were by my side But you're long gone, yeah you're long gone now Yeah
