I descended a dusty gravel ridgeBeneath the Bixby Canyon BridgeUntil I eventually arrivedAt the place where your soul had diedAnd barefoot in the shallow creekI grabbed some stones from underneathAnd waited for you to speak to meIn the silence, it became so very clearThat you had long ago disappearedI cursed myself for being surprisedThat this didn't play like it did in my mindAll the way from San FranciscoAs I chased the end of your road'Cause I've still got miles to goAnd I want to know my fateIf I keep up this wayIt's hard to want to stay awakeWhen everyone you meetThey all seem to be asleepAnd you wonder if you're missing your dreamYou can't see in a dreamYou can't see in a dreamYou just can't see in a dreamA dream, a dream, a dream, a dreamA dream, a dream, a dream, a dreamA dream, a dream, a dream, a dreamAnd then it started getting darkI trudged back to where the car was parkedNo closer to any kind of truthAs I must assume was the case with you
