Venture my way into the darkWhere we can slip one takes one by the handLet them crawl into the logs that damBrown changed the hue of her penExcited and screaming, their voices go wildAnd rise with the birds mating up in the pinesDown to puddles that breathe, covered by leavesWith mud they'll make prints on their backsBut how?Will it be just like they're dreaming?Will it be just like I'm dreaming?Will it be just like they're dreaming?Will it be just like I'm dreaming?But how?If they're awake till the dawn, well we won'tFret that they don't have our eyeThe ghosts came crowding around and then IWoke, you slept there on your sideFrom our window, two lanterns draw signs on the nightAnd light our two shadows, I watch with delightWill I want them to be who they will beOr to be more like their dadBut how?Will it be just like they're dreaming?Will it be just like I'm dreaming?Will it be just like they're dreaming?Will it be just like I'm dreaming?But how?When influence is threatenedMaybe I should let themMaybe we should let themAnd I have a questionAre you also frightened?Are you also frightened?Are you also frightened?Are you also frightened?Are you also frightened?Are you also frightened?Are you also frightened?Are you also frightened?No one should call you a dreamerNo one should call you a dreamerNo one should call you a dreamerNo one should call you a dreamerNot nowNot nowNot nowNot nowNot nowNot nowNot nowNot now
