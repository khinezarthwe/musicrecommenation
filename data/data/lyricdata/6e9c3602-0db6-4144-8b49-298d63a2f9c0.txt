Well we were born within an hour of each other.Our mothers said we could be sister and brother.Your name is Deborah, De-bor-ah.It never suited ya.And they said that when we grew up,we'd get married and never split up.Oh we never did it,Although I often thought of it.CHORUS:Oh Deborah, do you recall?Your house was very small,With wood-chip on the wall.When I came round to call,You didn't notice me at all,and I said:"Let's all meet up in the year 2000.Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown?Be there, two o'clock, by the fountain down the road.I never knew that you'd get married.I would be living down here on my own.On that damp and lonely Thursday years ago."You were the first girl at school to get breastsAnd Martin said that you were the best.Oh, the boys all loved you, but I was a mess.I had to watch them try and get you undressed.We were friends and that's as far as it went.I used to walk you home sometimes but it meant;Oh, it meant nothing to you'Cause you were so popular.CHORUSDo it,Oh yeah,Oh yeah.CHORUS X 2Oh, what are you doing Sunday, baby?Would you like to come and meet me, maybe?You can even bring your baby. Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh..What are you doing Sunday, baby?Would you like to come and meet me, maybe?You can even bring your baby.Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.. Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh
