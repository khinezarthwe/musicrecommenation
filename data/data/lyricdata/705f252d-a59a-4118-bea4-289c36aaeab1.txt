Iris in the morning rain, sitting in a seaIt's hard to tell the blues apart,She's salty just like meShe thinks we're on an islandOr she wishes that she wereShe thinks she hears the sirensBut I think it's okayIris in the morning rain sitting in a seaShe didn't wanna seeThe fruit was out of reachShe's caught between the oceanAnd the bear upon the beachImaginary waves could never drown youAnd I didn't want to tell herI didn't want to tell herIris on a ladder, climbing closer to the skyRising from the grind,She is a quitter just like ISitting on a rooftop,Watching molecules collideSafe above it all,She's drinking mercury on iceIris on a ladder climbing closer to the skyShe didn't wanna seeThe stars were out of reachShe's caught between the oceanAnd the bear upon the beachImaginary gods could never save youAnd I didn't want to tell herDidn't want to tell herShe didn't wanna seeThe stars were out of reachShe's caught between the oceanAnd the bear upon the beachImaginary gods could never save youBut I didn't want to tell herI didn't want to tell her
