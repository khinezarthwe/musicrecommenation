You can be my alphabet and I will be your calculatorAnd together we'll work out on the escalatorI will time you as you run up the downAnd you'll measure my footsteps as I blow through this townThe mean of our heights is divided by the nightsWhich is times'd by the daggers and the route of all our fightsThe pass of your poem is to swathe me in your knowingAnd the beauty of the word is that you don't have to show itOh, academia you can't pick me upSoothe me with your words when I need your loveI am a dash and you are a dotWhen will you see that I am all that you've got?I'm a binary code that you cracked long agoBut to you I'm just a novel that you wish you'd never wroteI'm greater than x and lesser than ySo why is it that I still can't catch your eye?You're a cryptic crossword, a song I've never heardWhile I sit here drawing circles I'm afraid of being hurtOh, academia you can't pick me upSoothe me with your words when I need your loveYou're a difficult equation with a knack for heart evasionWill you listen to my proof or will you add another page onIt appears to me the graph has come and stolen all the laughsIt appears to me the pen has over-analysed againAnd if I am a number I'm infinity plus oneAnd if you are five words you are afraid to be the oneAnd if you are a number you're infinity plus oneAnd if I am four words then I am needing of your loveOh, academia you can't pick me upSoothe me with your words when I need your loveOh, academia, academia, academiaOh, academia, academia, academia
