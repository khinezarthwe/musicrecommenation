I'm losing groundYou know how this world can beat you downAnd I'm made of clayI fear I'm the only one who thinks this wayI'm always falling down the same hill, bamboo puncturing this skinAnd nothing comes bleeding out of me just like a waterfall I'm drowning inTwo feet below the surface, I can still make out your wavy faceAnd if I could just reach you, maybe I could leave this placeI do not want thisI do not want thisI do not want thisI do not want thisAnd don't you tell me how I feelDon't you tell me how I feelDon't you tell me how I feelYou don't know just how I feelI stay inside my bedI have lived so many lives all in my headAnd don't tell me that you careThere really isn't anything, now, is there?You would know, wouldn't you? You extend your hand to those who sufferTo those who know what it really feels like to those who've had a taste like that means somethingAnd oh so sick I am and maybe I don't have a choiceAnd maybe that is all I have and maybe this is a cry for helpI do not want thisI do not want thisI do not want thisI do not want thisAnd don't you tell me how I feelDon't you tell me how I feelDon't you tell me how I feelYou don't know just how I feelI want to know everythingI want to be everywhereI want to fuck everyone in the worldI want to do something that mattersI want to know everythingI want to be everywhereI want to fuck everyone in the worldI want to do something that mattersI want to know everythingI want to be everywhereI want to fuck everyone in the worldI want to do something that mattersI want to know everythingI want to be everywhereI want to fuck everyone in the worldI want to do something that mattersI want to know everythingI want to be everywhereI want to fuck everyone in the worldI want to do something that matters
