Heard about your wife and kids where we sleptFelt their mouths with stitches at that were slowly litKept your uniform this time because I couldn't quitHaven't felt the ground so cold without getting sickAnd I'm still your fagI'm still your fagIt's a possibility to live without lipsKleenex love to fill right up with all the broken kidsI swore I drank your piss that night to see if I could liveBut my wrists couldn't stand the life that we missedAnd I'm still your fagI'm still your fagYou're only coming out because you came back inYou're only coming out cause you came back inI'm still your fagI'm still your fag
