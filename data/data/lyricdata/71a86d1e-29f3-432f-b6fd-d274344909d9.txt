On bended knee is no way to be freeLifting up an empty cup, I ask silentlyThat all my destinations will accept the one that's meSo I can breatheCircles they grow and they swallow people wholeHalf their lives they say goodnight to wives they'll never knowGot a mind full of questions and a teacher in my soulAnd so it goesDon't come closer or I'll have to goOwning me like gravity are places that pullIf ever there was someone to keep me at homeIt would be youEveryone I come across in cages they boughtThey think of me and my wandering but I'm never what they thoughtGot my indignation but I'm pure in all my thoughtsI'm aliveWind in my hair I feel part of everywhereUnderneath my being is a road that disappearedLate at night I hear the trees they're singing with the deadOverheadLeave it to me as I find a way to beConsider me a satellite forever orbitingI know all the rules but the rules did not know meGuaranteed
