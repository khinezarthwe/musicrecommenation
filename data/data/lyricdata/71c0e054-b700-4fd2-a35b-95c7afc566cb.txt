The lunatic is on the grassThe lunatic is on the grassRemembering games and daisy chains and laughsGot to keep the loonies on the pathThe lunatic is in the hallThe lunatics are in my hallThe paper holds their folded faces to the floorAnd every day the paper boy brings moreAnd if the dam breaks open many years too soonAnd if there is no room upon the hillAnd if your head explodes with dark forebodings tooI'll see you on the dark side of the moonThe lunatic is in my headThe lunatic is in my headYou raise the blade you make the changeYou rearrange me till I'm saneYou lock the doorAnd throw away the keyThere's someone in my head but it's not meAnd if the cloud bursts thunder in your earYou shout and no one seems to hearAnd if the band you're in starts playing different tunesI'll see you on the dark side of the moon
