Tonight the city is full of morguesAnd all the toilets are overflowingThere's shopping malls coming out of the wallsAs we walk out among the manureThat's whyI pay no mindI pay no mindI pay no mindGive the finger to the rock 'n roll singerAs he's dancing upon your paycheckThe sales climb high through the garbage pail skyLike a giant dildo crushing the sunThat's whyI pay no mindSleep in slimeI just got signedSo get out your lead-pipe pipe dreamsGet out your ten foot flagsThe insects are huge and the poison's all been usedAnd the drugs wont kill your day job, honeyThat's whyI pay no mindI pay no mindI pay no mindThat's whyI pay no mindI pay no mindI pay no mindI pay no mindI pay no mindI pay no mindI pay no mind
