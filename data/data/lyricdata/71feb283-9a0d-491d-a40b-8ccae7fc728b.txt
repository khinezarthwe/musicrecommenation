There's the moon asking to stayLong enough for the clouds to fly me awayWell it's my time comingI'm not afraid to dieMy fading voice sings of loveBut she cries to the clicking of timeOf timeWait in the fireWait in the fireAnd she weeps on my armWalking to the bright lights in sorrowOh drink a bit of wine we both might go tomorrowOh my loveAnd the rain is falling and I believeMy time has comeIt reminds me of the painI might leaveLeave behindWait in the fireWait in the fire(It reminds me of the painI might leaveLeave behind)And I feel them drown my nameSo easy to know and forget with this kissI'm not afraid to go but it goes so slowWait in the fireWait in the fireWait in the fireWait in the fireWait in the fireWait in the fireWait in the fireWait in the fire
