That's how it startsWe go back to your houseYou check the chartsAnd start to figure it outAnd if it's crowded, all the betterBecause we know we're gonna be up lateBut if you're worried about the weatherThen you picked the wrong place to stayThat's how it startsAnd so it startsYou switch the engine onWe set controls for the heart of the sunOne of the ways that we show our ageAnd if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up, if the sun comes upAnd I still don't wanna stagger homeThen it's the memory of our bettersThat are keeping us on our feetYou spent the first five years trying to get with the planAnd the next five years trying to be with your friends againOh, you're talking 45 turns just as fast as you canYeah, I know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretendIt comes apartThe way it does in bad filmsExcept the partWhere the moral kicks inAnd when we're running out of the drugsAnd the conversation's grinding awayI wouldn't trade one stupid decisionFor another five years of lifeOh, you drop the first ten years just as fast as you canAnd the next ten people who are trying to be politeWhen you're blowing 85 days in the middle of FranceYeah, I know it gets tired, only where are your friends tonight?And to tell the truthOh, this could be the last timeSo here we goLike a sales force into the nightAnd if I made a fool, if I made a fool, if I made a foolOn the road, there's always thisAnd if I'm sued into submissionI can still come home to thisAnd with a face like a dad and a laughable standYou can sleep on the plane or review what you saidWhen you're drunk and the kids look impossibly tannedYou think over and overOh, if the trip and the plan come apart in your handYou can turn it on yourself you ridiculous clownYou forgot what you meant when you read what you saidAnd you knew you were tiredBut then where are your friends tonight?Where are your friends tonight?Where are your friends tonight?If I could see all my friends tonightIf I could see all my friends tonightIf I could see all my friends tonightIf I could see all my friends tonight
