Honey, the party, you went away quickly But oh that's the trouble with ticking and tocking I licked the ice cube from your empty glass Oh we stayed much too late till they're cleaning the ashtrays Do you have change or a button, or cash? All my pockets hang out like two surrender flags Oh, but I'd pay anything to keep my conscience clean I'm keeping my eye on the exits, I'm steady now How did we get here with creaks in these chairs? Oh, there aren't enough hands to point all the fingers But I sit transfixed by a hole in your T-shirt I've said much too much and they're trying to speak up
