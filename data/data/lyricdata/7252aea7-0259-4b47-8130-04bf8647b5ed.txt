Honey, the party, you went away quicklyBut oh that's the trouble with ticking and tockingI licked the ice cube from your empty glassOh we stayed much too late till they're cleaning the ashtraysDo you have change or a button, or cash?All my pockets hang out like two surrender flagsOh, but I'd pay anything to keep my conscience cleanI'm keeping my eye on the exits, I'm steady nowHow did we get here with creaks in these chairs?Oh, there aren't enough hands to point all the fingersBut I sit transfixed by a hole in your T-shirtI've said much too much and they're trying to speak up
