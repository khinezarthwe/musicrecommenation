Have you ever thought about your soulCan it be saved?Or perhaps you think that when you are deadYou just stay in your graveIs God just a thought within your headOr is he a part of you?Is Christ just a name that you read in a bookWhen you were in school?When you think about death do you lose your breathOr do you keep your cool?Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a ropeDo you think he's a fool?Well I've seen the truth, yes I've seen the lightAnd I've changed my waysAnd I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scaredAt the end of our daysCould it be you're afraid of what your friends might sayIf they knew you believe in God above?They should realize before they criticizeThat God is the only way to loveIs your mind so small that you have to fallIn with the pack wherever they runWill you still sneer when death is nearAnd say that you may as well worship the sun?I think it was true it was people like you that crucified ChristI think it is sad the opinion you had was the only one voicedWill you be so sure when your day is near, say you don't believe?You had the chance but you turned it down, now you can't retrievePerhaps you'll think before you say thatGod is dead and goneOpen your eyes, just realizeThat he's the oneThe only one who can save you nowFrom all this sin and hateOr will you still jeer at all you hear?Yes, I think it's too late
