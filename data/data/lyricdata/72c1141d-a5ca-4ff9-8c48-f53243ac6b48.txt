Baby when I saw you turning at the end of the streetI knew a time was gone and it took me like agesJust to understand that I was afraid to be a simple guyI tried my best to smile but deep inside my heartI felt it was shouting like a crowd dancingI guess I couldn't live without the things that made my life what it isCan't you hear it calling oh yeahEverybody's dancin' oh yeahTonight everything is overI feel too youngI can't lie on my bed without thinking I was wrongBut when that feeling calls this world becomes anotherNighttime won't hold me in your arms againI got a very good friend who says he can't believe the love I giveIs not enough to end your fearsI guess I couldn't live without the things that made my life what it isCan't you hear it calling oh yeahEverybody's shakin' oh yeahTonight everything is overI feel too youngOh rainfalls and hard times coming they won't leave me tonightI wish I knew what I was doingJust to let this spirit surviveEverybody's dancing oh yeahI guess I couldn't live without the things that made my life what it isCan't you hear it calling oh yeahEverybody's dancing oh yeahTonight everything is overI feel too young
