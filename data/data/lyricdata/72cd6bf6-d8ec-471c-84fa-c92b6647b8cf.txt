Save some faceYou know you've only got oneChange your waysWhile you're youngBoyOne day you'll be a manOh, girlHe'll help you understandSmile like you mean itSmile like you mean itLooking backAt sunsets on the EastsideWe lost trackOf the timeDreamsAren't what they used to beSome thingsSlide by so carelesslySmile like you mean itSmile like you mean itAnd someone is calling my nameFrom the back of the restaurantAnd someone is playing a gameIn the house that I grew up inAnd someone will drive her aroundDown the same streets that I didOn the same streets that I didSmile like you mean itSmile like you mean itSmile like you mean itSmile like you mean itOh noOh no, no, noOh noOh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
