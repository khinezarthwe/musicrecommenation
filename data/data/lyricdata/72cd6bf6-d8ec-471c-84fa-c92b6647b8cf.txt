Save some face You know you've only got one Change your ways While you're young Boy One day you'll be a man Oh, girl He'll help you understand Smile like you mean it Smile like you mean it Looking back At sunsets on the Eastside We lost track Of the time Dreams Aren't what they used to be Some things Slide by so carelessly Smile like you mean it Smile like you mean it And someone is calling my name From the back of the restaurant And someone is playing a game In the house that I grew up in And someone will drive her around Down the same streets that I did On the same streets that I did Smile like you mean it Smile like you mean it Smile like you mean it Smile like you mean it Oh no Oh no, no, no Oh no Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
