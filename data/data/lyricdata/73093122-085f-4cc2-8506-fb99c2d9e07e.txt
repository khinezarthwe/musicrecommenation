I see trees of green, red roses, tooI see them bloom for me and youAnd I say to myselfWhat a wonderful worldI see skies of blue and clouds of whiteBright sunny days, dark sacred nightsAnd I think to myselfWhat a wonderful worldColors of the rainbow are so pretty in the skiesAre also on the faces of people walkin' byI see friends shakin' hands, sayin', "How do you do?"They're really sayin', "I love you"I see babies cry, what watch them growThey'll learn much more than I'll ever knowAnd I think to myselfWhat a wonderful worldYes, I think to myselfWhat a wonderful worldAnd I say to myselfWhat a wonderful world
