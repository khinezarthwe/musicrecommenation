I see trees of green, red roses, too I see them bloom for me and you And I say to myself What a wonderful world I see skies of blue and clouds of white Bright sunny days, dark sacred nights And I think to myself What a wonderful world Colors of the rainbow are so pretty in the skies Are also on the faces of people walkin' by I see friends shakin' hands, sayin', " How do you do?" They're really sayin', " I love you" I see babies cry, what watch them grow They'll learn much more than I'll ever know And I think to myself What a wonderful world Yes, I think to myself What a wonderful world And I say to myself What a wonderful world
