The piercing radiant moon ()The storming of poor June ()All the life running through her hair ()Approaching guiding light ()Our shallow years in fright ()Dreams are made, winding ()Through my head ()Through my headBefore you know, awakeYour lives are open wideThe V-chip gives them sightOf all the life running through her hairThe spiders all in tuneThe evening of the moonDreams are made, windingThrough my headThrough my headBefore you know, awakeThrough my headThrough my headBefore you knowBefore you know I will be waiting, all awakeDreams are made winding through her hairDreams are made winding through her hair
