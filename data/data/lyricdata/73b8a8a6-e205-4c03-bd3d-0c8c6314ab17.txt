Why'd you cut holes in the face of the moon base?Don't you know about the temperature change in the cold black shadow?Are you mad at your walls or hoping that an unknown force can repair things for you?Pardon all the time that you've thrown into your pale gray gardenIf the ship will never come you've gotta move alongEven a bird would want a taste of dirt from abyssal darkThe prick of a feather could make a kingdom burnAnd the bloodshed start, the falling apart,Made me a shadow in the shape of wonder, the waves of blackIf she's going under I can hold my breathTill the sky comes back or drown like a ratHe's a ratTo catch a monster, we make a movieSet the tempo and cut and cut its brains outIt will inspire on the burning pyreHalf the distance, half the motionCommunication, it's easy as the ocean
