I travelled far and wide through many different timesWhat did you see there?I saw the saints with their toysWhat did you see there?I saw all knowledge destroyedI travelled far and wide through many different timesI travelled far and wide through prisons of the crossWhat did you see there?The power and glory of sinWhat did you see there?The blood of Christ on their skinsI travelled far and wide through many different timesI travelled far and wide and unknown martyrs diedWhat did you see there?I saw the one-sided trialsWhat did you see there?I saw the tears as they criedThey had tears in their eyesTears in their eyesTears in their eyesTears in their eyes
