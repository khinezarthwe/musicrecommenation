You are one of God's mistakesYou crying, tragic waste of skinI'm well aware of how it achesAnd you still won't let me inNow I'm breaking down your doorTo try and save your swollen faceThough I don't like you anymoreYou lying, trying waste of spaceBefore our innocence was lostYou were always one of thoseBlessed with lucky sevensAnd the voice that made me cryMy, oh myYou were mother nature's sonSomeone to whom I could relateYour needle and your damage doneRemains a sordid twist of fateNow I'm trying to wake you upTo pull you from the liquid sky'Cause if I don't we'll both end upWith just your song to say goodbyeMy, oh myA song to say goodbyeA song to say goodbyeA song to sayBefore our innocence was lostYou were always one of thoseBlessed with lucky sevensAnd the voice that made me cryIt's a song to say goodbyeIt's a song to say goodbyeIt's a song to say goodbyeIt's a song to say goodbyeIt's a song to say goodbyeIt's a song to say goodbyeIt's a song to say goodbyeIt's a song to say goodbye
