Love's the Funeral Of HeartsAnd an ode for cruelty,When angels cry bloodOn flowers of evil in bloom,The Funeral Of HeartsAnd a plea for mercy,When love is a gunSeparating me from you.She was the sun shining uponThe tomb of your hopes and dreams so frail,He was the moon painting youWith its glow so vulnerable and pale.Love's the Funeral Of HeartsAnd an ode for cruelty,When angels cry bloodOn flowers of evil in bloom,The Funeral Of HeartsAnd a plea for mercy,When love is a gunSeparating me from you.She was the wind carrying inAll the troubles and fearsYou've for years tried to forget,He was the fireRestless and wild and you wereLike a moth to that flame.The heretic seal beyond divinePray to God who's deaf and blindThe last rites for souls on fireThree little words and a question why.Love's the Funeral Of HeartsAnd an ode for cruelty,When angels cry bloodOn flowers of evil in bloom,The Funeral Of HeartsAnd a plea for mercy,When love is a gunSeparating me from you.The Funeral Of HeartsAnd an ode for cruelty,When angels cry bloodOn flowers of evil in bloom
