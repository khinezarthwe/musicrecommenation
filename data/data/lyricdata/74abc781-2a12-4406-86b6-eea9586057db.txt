Deep down in Louisiana close to New OrleansWay back up in the woods among the evergreensThere stood a log cabin made of earth and woodWhere lived a country boy named Johnny B. GoodeWho never ever learned to read or write so wellBut he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bellGo goGo Johnny go!GoGo Johnny go!GoGo Johnny go!GoGo Johnny go!GoJohnny B. Goode!He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sackGo sit beneath the tree by the railroad trackOh, the engineer would see him sitting in the shadeStrumming with the rhythm that the drivers madeThe people passing by, they would stop and sayOh my, but that little country boy could playGo goGo Johnny go!GoGo Johnny go!GoGo Johnny go!GoGo Johnny go!GoJohnny B.

Goode tonight"Go goGo Johnny goGo go go Johnny goGo go go Johnny goGo go go Johnny goGoJohnny B. Goode
