It's like gunfire And you knew but you could never say Then comes forth Do you like the way the water tastes?' Cause it's coming round, round Beware the water You should know, babe At least pretend, you did know, why? It's not like you were warned So go on, take a drink, release There You like the way the water tastes? It's like gunfire You knew that it was never safe Think once more Do you like the way the water tastes?' Cause it's coming round, round once more Beware the water Beware the water Teeth are dry The wind blows Fill cup, drink it There you go Beware the water Beware the water Beware the water Do you like the way the water tastes? Do you like the way the water tastes?
