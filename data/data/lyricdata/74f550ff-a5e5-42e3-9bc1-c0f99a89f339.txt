I can see your eyes from hereAnd I can't see anything in betweenEverything I thought I ought to know about youHas vanished like the snow when the sun comes outThere's nothing but green lights from hereNothing but empty roadsYou and I gonna drive ourselves out of this townIn a nineteen eighty nine black Mercedes-BenzI can hear your voice from here girlAnd I can't hear no other soundNo need to spend anymore time 'partThat's if I'm not being left out anymoreI got a hold of what's going onI've got my foot in the door so to speakThere's nothing but green lights from hereThere's nothing but green lights from here, from here
