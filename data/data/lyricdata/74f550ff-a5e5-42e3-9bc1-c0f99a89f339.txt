I can see your eyes from here And I can't see anything in between Everything I thought I ought to know about you Has vanished like the snow when the sun comes out There's nothing but green lights from here Nothing but empty roads You and I gonna drive ourselves out of this town In a nineteen eighty nine black Mercedes- Benz I can hear your voice from here girl And I can't hear no other sound No need to spend anymore time 'part That's if I'm not being left out anymore I got a hold of what's going on I've got my foot in the door so to speak There's nothing but green lights from here There's nothing but green lights from here, from here
