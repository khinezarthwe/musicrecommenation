This is so hard for meTo find the words to sayMy thoughts are standing stillCaptive inside of meAll emotions starts to hideAnd nothing is getting throughWatch meFadingI'm losingAll my instinctsFalling into darknessTear down these walls for meStop me from going underYou are the only one who knowsI'm holding backIt's not too late for meTo keep from sinking furtherI'm trying to find my way outTear down these walls for me nowSo much uncertaintyI don't like this feelingI'm sinking like a stoneEach time I try to speakThere's a voice I'm hearingAnd it changes everythingWatch meCrawl fromThe wreckageOf my silenceConversationFailingTear down these walls for meStop me from going underYou are the only one who knowsI'm holding backIt's not to late for meTo keep from sinking furtherI'm trying to find my way outTear down these wallsEverytime you choose to turn awayIs it worth the price you pay?Is there someone who will wait for youOne more timeOne more time?Watch meFadingI'm losingAll my instinctsFalling into darknessTear down these walls for meStop me from going underYou are the only one who knowsI'm holding backIt's not to late for meTo keep from sinking furtherI'm trying to find my way outTear down these walls for me nowTear down these walls for meIt's not too late for meTear down these walls for me
