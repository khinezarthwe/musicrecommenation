The winter windIs blowing so strongMy hands have gotNo glovesWish to my soleThat I could haveThe boy I'm dreaming ofDon't you remember me, babeI remember you quite wellCaused me to leaveAll of New York townWith a high sheriff on my tailA high sheriff on my tail, boys,High sheriff on my trail.All because I've fallen forA curly headed dark-eyed boyWho's gonna strokeYour coal black hairAnd your sandy colored skinWho's gonna walk you side by sideAnd tell you everything is all rightWho's gonna lookYou straight in the eyeAnd hold your bad luck handWho's gonna walk youWho's gonna talk to youAnd who's gonna be your womanThe winter windIs blowing so strongMy hands have gotNo glovesDon't you remember me, babeI remember you quite well
