Press your foot down like I told you See the houses rush on by Reach out your hand touch my arm and Let me breath you,as you cry I can hardly wait Hope we won't be late And you know its time Just ignore all signs The goal is to get there Without fear in high speed We dance through the darkness We won't stop 'til we're stopped Suck my thumb and feel my finger As it wipes your tears away Watch the concrete come on closer Marks of us will always stay Face is aged by fear Pass along the weir And we won't grow old Corpse look fine when cold The goal is to get there Without fear in high speed We dance through the darkness We won't stop 'til we're stopped The goal is to get there Without fear in high speed We dance through the darkness We won't stop 'til we're stopped The goal is to get there Without fear in high speed We dance through the darkness We won't stop 'til we're stopped
