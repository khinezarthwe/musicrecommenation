Press your foot down like I told youSee the houses rush on byReach out your hand touch my arm andLet me breath you,as you cryI can hardly waitHope we won't be lateAnd you know its timeJust ignore all signsThe goal is to get thereWithout fear in high speedWe dance through the darknessWe won't stop 'til we're stoppedSuck my thumb and feel my fingerAs it wipes your tears awayWatch the concrete come on closerMarks of us will always stayFace is aged by fearPass along the weirAnd we won't grow oldCorpse look fine when coldThe goal is to get thereWithout fear in high speedWe dance through the darknessWe won't stop 'til we're stoppedThe goal is to get thereWithout fear in high speedWe dance through the darknessWe won't stop 'til we're stoppedThe goal is to get thereWithout fear in high speedWe dance through the darknessWe won't stop 'til we're stopped
