I met him in a crowded roomWhere people go to drink away their gloomHe sat me down and so beganThe story of a charmless manEducated the expensive wayHe knows his Claret from his BeaujolaisI think he'd like to have been Ronnie KrayBut then nature didn't make him that wayHe thinks his educated airs, those family sharesWill protect him, we'll respect himHe moves in circles of friends who just pretendThat they like him, he does the same to themAnd when you put it all togetherThere's the model of a charmless manHe knows the swingers and their cavalrySays he can get in anywhere for freeI began to go a little cross-eyedAnd from this charmless man I just had to hideHe talks at speed he gets nosebleedsHe doesn't see his days are tumbling down upon himAnd yet he tries so hard to pleaseHe's just so keen for you to listenBut no-one's listeningAnd when you put it all together there's the model of a charmless man
