Staring at the sea, will she come?Is there hope for me after all is said and done?Anything at any price, all of this for youAll the spoils of a wasted life, all of this for youAll the world has closed her eyes, tired faith all worn and thinFor all we could have done and all that could have beenOcean pulls me close and whispers in my earThe destiny I've chose, all becoming clearThe currents have their say, the time is drawing nearWashes me away, makes me disappearAnd I descend from graceIn arms of undertowI will take my placeIn the great belowI can still feel you even so far awayI can still feel you even so far awayI can still feel you even so far awayI can still feel you even so far awayEven so far awayEven so far awayEven so far awayEven so far away
