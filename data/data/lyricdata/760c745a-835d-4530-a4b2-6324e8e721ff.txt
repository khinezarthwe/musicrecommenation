Peace will come to mePeace will come to meI'm leaving bitterness behind this timeI'm cleaning out my mindThere is no space for the regretsI will remember to forgetJust look at me, I am walking love incarnateLook at the frequencies at which I vibrateI'm going to light up the worldPeace will come to mePeace will come to meI'm leaving anger in the pastWith all the shadows that it castThere is a radar in my heartI should have trusted from the startJust look at me, I'm a living act of holinessGiving all the positivity that I possessI'm going to light up the worldPeace will come to meJust wait and seePeace will come to meIt's meant to bePeace will come to meJust wait and seePeace will come to meIt's an inevitability
