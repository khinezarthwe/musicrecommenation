How can I think I'm standing strongYet feel the air beneath my feet?How can happiness feel so wrong?How can misery feel so sweet?How can you let me watch you sleepThen break my dreams the way you do?How can I have got in so deep?Why did I fall in love with you?This is the closest thing to crazy I have ever beenFeeling twenty-two, acting seventeenThis is the nearest thing to crazy I have ever knownI was never crazy on my own and now I know that there's a link between the twoBeing close to craziness and being close to youHow can you make me fall apartThen break my fall with loving lies?It's so easy to break a heartIt's so easy to close your eyesHow can you treat me like a childYet like a child I yearn for you?How can anyone feel so wild?How can anyone feel so blue?This is the closest thing to crazy I have ever beenFeeling twenty-two, acting seventeenThis is the nearest thing to crazy I have ever knownI was never crazy on my own and now I know that there's a link between the twoBeing close to craziness and being close to youAnd being close to youAnd being close to you
