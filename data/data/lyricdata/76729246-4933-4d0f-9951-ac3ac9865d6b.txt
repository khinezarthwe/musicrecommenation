She's out of my lifeShe's out of my lifeAnd I don't know whether to laugh or cryI don't know whether to live or dieAnd it cuts like a knifeShe's out of my lifeIt's out of my handsIt's out of my handsTo think for two years she was hereAnd I took her for granted I was so cavalierNow the way that it standsShe's out of my handsSo I've learned that love's not possessionAnd I've learned that love won't waitNow I've learned that love needs expressionBut I learned too late...She's out of my lifeShe's out of my lifeDamned indecision and cursed prideKept my love for her locked deep insideAnd it cuts like a knifeShe's out of my life
