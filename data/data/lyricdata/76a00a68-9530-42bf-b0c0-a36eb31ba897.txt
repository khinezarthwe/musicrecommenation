I got a catholic blockInside my headI let it go to workBring it all back homeIt serves you rightAnd I can motor downYou got to earn your freedomGet it on my ownI just live foreverThere just is no endI just trust the oppressionLike I trust your friendsI got a catholic blockInside my headI let it play aroundIron to goldCome back to me awhileI got a catholic block it's around my headI got a catholic block and it's blood orange redI got a catholic block do you like to fuck?I got a catholic block guess I'm out of luck
