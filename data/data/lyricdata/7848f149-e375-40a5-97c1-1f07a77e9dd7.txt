Epilepsy is dancingShe's the Christ now departingAnd I'm finding my rhythmAs I twist in the snowThe metal burned in meDown the brain of my riverFor the fire was searchingFor a waterway homeI cry,My eyes pinned insideWith green jewelsHanging like Christmas stars from a golden veinAs I came to a screamingHold me while I'm dreamingFor my fingers are curlingAnd I cannot breatheThen I cried in the kitchenHow I'd seen your ghost witchingThere's a soldering blue lineBetween my eyesCut me in quadrantsLeave me in the cornerCut me in quadrantsLeave me in the cornerCut me in quadrantsLeave me in the cornerCut me in quadrantsLeave me in the cornerOoh now, it's passingOoh now, I'm dancingOoh now, it's passingOoh now, I'm dancingOoh now, it's passingOoh now, I'm dancingOoh now, it's passingOoh now, I'm dancing
