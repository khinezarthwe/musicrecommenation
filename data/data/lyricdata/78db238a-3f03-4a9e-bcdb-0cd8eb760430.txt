On another world by another starAt another place and timeIn another state of consciousnessIn another state of mindEverything was almost perfectEverything fell into placeThe jury reached a different verdictBefore the judge dismissed the caseIn a parallel universeThat's happening right nowThings between us must be worseBut it's hard to see just howAnd everything could have been perfectEverything in the right placeThen I wouldn't have to play the suspectAccused, abandoned and disgracedI didn't shoot, I didn't pull the triggerIt wasn't me, I'm just a plain and simple singerI heard the sound, I turned my head aroundTo watch our love shot downIn another lonely universeWe're laying side by sideAnd no one's hurt and no one's cursedAnd no one needs to hideAnd everything is almost perfectEverything is almost rightThere are never any conflictsThere are never any fights
