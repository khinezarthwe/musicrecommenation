I have climbed the highest mountainsI have run through the fieldsOnly to be with youOnly to be with you.I have run, I have crawledI have scaled these city wallsThese city wallsOnly to be with you.But I still haven't foundWhat I'm looking for.But I still haven't foundWhat I'm looking for.I have kissed honey lipsFelt the healing in her finger tipsIt burned like fireThis burning desire.I have spoke with the tongue of angelsI have held the hand of a devilIt was warm in the nightI was cold as a stone.But I still haven't foundWhat I'm looking for.But I still haven't foundWhat I'm looking for.I believe in the Kingdom ComeThen all the colours will bleed into oneBleed into one.But yes, I'm still running.You broke the bondsAnd you loosened the chainsCarried the cross of all my shameAll my shame, you know I believe it.But I still haven't foundWhat I'm looking for.But I still haven't foundWhat I'm looking for.But I still haven't foundWhat I'm looking for.But I still haven't foundWhat I'm looking for.
