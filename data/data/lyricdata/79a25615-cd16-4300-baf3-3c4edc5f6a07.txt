There are things that I said I would never doThere are fears that I cannot believe have come trueFor my soul is too sick and too little and too lateAnd myself, I have grown too weary to hateThe more I stay in hereThe more it's not so clearThe more I stay in hereThe more I disappearAs far as I have goneI knew what side I'm onBut now I'm not so sureThe line begins to blurIs there somebody on top of me?I don't know, I don't knowIsn't anybody stopping me?I don't know, I don't knowI won't try and hold my breathI don't know, I don't knowJust how far down can I go?I don't know, I don't know, I don't knowAs I lay here and stareThe fabric starts to tearIt's far beyond repairAnd I don't really careAs far as I have goneI knew what side I'm onBut now I'm not so sureThe line begins to blur
