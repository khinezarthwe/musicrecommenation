Love me, love me, love me, love me, say you doLet me fly away with youFor my love is like the windAnd wild is the wind, wild is the windGive me more than one caressSatisfy this hungrinessLet the wind blow through your heartFor wild is the wind, wild is the windYou touch me, I hear the sound of mandolinsYou kiss me, with your kiss my life beginsYou're spring to me, all things to meDon't you know, you're life itselfLike the leaf clings to the treeOh, my darling, cling to meFor we're like creatures of the windWild is the wind, wild is the windYou touch me, I hear the sound of mandolinsYou kiss me with your kiss my life beginsYou're spring to me, all things to meDon't you know, you're life itselfLike the leaf clings to the treeOh, my darling, cling to meFor we're like creatures in the windAnd wild is the windWild is the windWild is the windWild is the windWild is the wind
