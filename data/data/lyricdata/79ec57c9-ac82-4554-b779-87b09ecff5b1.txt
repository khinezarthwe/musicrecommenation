YeahI watched you walk awayHopeless, with nothing to sayI strain my eyesHoping to see you againThis is my curseThis is my curseThis is my curseThis is my curseThere is love burning to find youWill you wait for me?Will you be there?Your silence haunts meBut still I hunger for youThis is my curseThis is my curseThis is my curseThis is my curseThere is love burning to find youWill you wait for me?To see you againDying inside these wallsDying inside these wallsAnd I see your faceIn these tears, in these tearsAnd I see your faceThere is loveThere is loveThere is loveThere is love
