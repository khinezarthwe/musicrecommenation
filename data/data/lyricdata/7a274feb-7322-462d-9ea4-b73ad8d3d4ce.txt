Decided to sneak off away from your stomachAnd try your pulseThey captured what seemed all unknowing and candidBut they suspected it was falseShe's playful, the boring would warn you be carefulOf her brigadeIn order to tame this relentless marauderMove away from the paradeShe was walking on the tables in the glasshouseEndearingly bedraggled in the windSubtle in her method of seductionTwenty little tragedies beginAnd she would throw her feather-boa in the roadIf she thought that it would set the sceneUnfittingly dipped into your companionsEnlightened them to make you seethAnd there's affection to rentThe age of the understatementBefore the attraction fermentsKiss me properly and pull me apartAffection to rentThe age of the understatementBefore this attraction fermentsKiss me properly and pull me apartAnd my fingers scratch at my hairBefore my mind can get too recklessThe idea of seeing you hereIs enough to make the sweat go cold
