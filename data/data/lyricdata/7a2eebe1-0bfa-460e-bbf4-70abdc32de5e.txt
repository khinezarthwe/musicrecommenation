Baby, you understand me nowIf sometimes you see that I'm madDon't you know no one alive can always be an angel?When everything goes wrong, you see some badBut I'm just a soul whose intentions are goodOh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstoodYou know sometimes baby I'm so carefreeWith a joy that's hard to hideAnd then sometimes it seems again that all I have is worryAnd then you're bound to see my other sideBut I'm just a soul whose intentions are goodOh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstoodIf I seem edgy, I want you to knowI never mean to take it out on youLife has its problems and I get more than my shareBut that's one thing I never mean to do'Cause I love youOh baby, I'm just humanDon't you know I have faults like anyone?Sometimes I find myself alone regrettingSome little foolish thing, some simple thing that I've done'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are goodOh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstoodDon't let me be misunderstoodI try so hard, so please don't let me be misunderstood
