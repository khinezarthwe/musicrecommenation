It's the memory of your warmthThat keeps me aliveWhen I'm burningAnd my world's closing inOoh, I'm on fireOoh, I'm on fireI hold on to a wheel of burning fearOoh, I'm on fireOoh, I'm on fireAnd then the sky is falling inAnd I see your eyesHiding in the shadowsHiding in the flamesOoh, I'm on fireOoh, I'm on fireI'm on fireIt's the memory of your warmthThat keeps me aliveWhen I'm burningAnd my world's closing inOoh, I'm on fireOoh, I'm on fireI'm on fireWhen I feel like I'm dyingAnd soon I shall expireI'm on fireI'm on fireWhy is thatThat I feel like I'm on fire?Blue angel
