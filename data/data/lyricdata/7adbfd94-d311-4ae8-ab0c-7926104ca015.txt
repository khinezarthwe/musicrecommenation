When your only friends are hotel rooms Hands are distant lullabies If I could turn around I would tonight These roads never seemed so long Since your paper heart stopped beating Leaving me suddenly alone Will daybreak ever come? Who's gonna call on Sunday morning? Who's gonna drive you home? I just want one more chance To put my arms in fragile hands I thought you said forever, over and over A sleepless night becomes bitter oblivion These thoughts run through my head, over and over Complaints of violins become my only friends August evenings Bring solemn warnings to remember To kiss the ones you love goodnight You never know what temporal days may bring Laugh, love, live free, and sing When life is in discord Praise ye the Lord Who's gonna call on Sunday morning? Who's gonna drive you home? I just want one more chance To put my arms in fragile hands I thought you said forever, over and over A sleepless night becomes bitter oblivion These thoughts run through my head, over and over Complaints of violins become my only friends Friends I thought you said forever, over and over A sleepless night becomes bitter oblivion These thoughts run through my head, over and over Complaints of violins become my only friends I thought you said forever, over and over( And over and over) These thoughts run through my head
