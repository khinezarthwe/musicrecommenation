When your only friends are hotel roomsHands are distant lullabiesIf I could turn around I would tonightThese roads never seemed so longSince your paper heart stopped beatingLeaving me suddenly aloneWill daybreak ever come?Who's gonna call on Sunday morning?Who's gonna drive you home?I just want one more chanceTo put my arms in fragile handsI thought you said forever, over and overA sleepless night becomes bitter oblivionThese thoughts run through my head, over and overComplaints of violins become my only friendsAugust eveningsBring solemn warnings to rememberTo kiss the ones you love goodnightYou never know what temporal days may bringLaugh, love, live free, and singWhen life is in discordPraise ye the LordWho's gonna call on Sunday morning?Who's gonna drive you home?I just want one more chanceTo put my arms in fragile handsI thought you said forever, over and overA sleepless night becomes bitter oblivionThese thoughts run through my head, over and overComplaints of violins become my only friendsFriendsI thought you said forever, over and overA sleepless night becomes bitter oblivionThese thoughts run through my head, over and overComplaints of violins become my only friendsI thought you said forever, over and over(And over and over)These thoughts run through my head
