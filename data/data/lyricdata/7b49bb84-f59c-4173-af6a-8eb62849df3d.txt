Happy Jack wasn't tall, but he was a manHe lived in the sand at the Isle of ManThe kids would all sing, he would take the wrong keySo they rode on his head in a hurry on Quay.The kids couldn't hurt JackThey tried and tried and triedThey dropped things on his backAnd lied and lied and lied and lied and liedBut they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lappingAnd they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happyBut they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lappingAnd they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happyThe kids couldn't hurt JackThey tried and tried and triedThey dropped things on his backAnd lied and lied and lied and lied and liedBut they couldn't stop Jack, or the waters lappingAnd they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy(I saw ya!)
