Get out of it I saw two shadow men on the Vallance road They said they'd pay me for your address, oh, I was so bold To say " You see these two cold fingers These crooked fingers I show? You's a way to mean no" Well, they didn't like that much, I can tell you They said, " Sunshine, I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes" And they chased me up three flights of stairs Caught me in the lift, I sighed and said " Hello" But you're impossible And it's just like he's in another world He doesn't see the danger on show He'll wind up like Joseph, bloody in the hole It's just like she's in another world How they suit each other, no, no Cos you never get close It's impossible Saw the same two men on the Cally road Said now they'd double their offer, I was so bold To say " You see these two cold fingers I know These crooked fingers I show? Oh, you's a way to mean no" But it's just like he's in another world He doesn't see the danger on show And he'll end up like Joseph, bloody in a hole It's just like she's in another world And how they suit each other, oh no You never get close Unstoppable It's just like we're in another world And how we suit each other, no, no But you never get close That's close enough
