I'll sing it one last time for youThen we really have to goYou've been the only thing that's rightIn all I've doneAnd I can barely look at youBut every single time I doI know we'll make it anywhereAway from hereLight up, light upAs if you have a choiceEven if you cannot hear my voiceI'll be right beside you, dearLouder, louderAnd we'll run for our livesI can hardly speak, I understandWhy you can't raise your voice to sayTo think I might not see those eyesMakes it so hard not to cryAnd as we say our long goodbyesI nearly doLight up, light upAs if you have a choiceEven if you cannot hear my voiceI'll be right beside you, dearLouder, louderAnd we'll run for our livesI can hardly speak, I understandWhy you can't raise your voice to saySlower, slowerWe don't have time for thatAll I want is to find an easier wayTo get out of our little headsHave heart, my dearWe're bound to be afraidEven if it's just for a few daysMaking up for all this messLight up, light upAs if you have a choiceEven if you cannot hear my voiceI'll be right beside you, dear
