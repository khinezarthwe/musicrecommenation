They say an end can be a startFeels like I've been buried yet I'm still aliveIt's like a bad day that never endsI feel the chaos around meA thing I don't try to denyI'd better learn to accept thatThere are things in my life I can't controlThey say love ain't nothing but a soreI don't even know what love isToo many tears have had to fallDon't you know I'm so tired of it allI have known terror dizzy spellsFinding out the secrets words won't tellWhatever it is it can't be namedThere's a part of my world that's fading awayYou know I don't want to be cleverTo be brilliant or superiorTrue like ice, true like fireNow I know that a breeze can blow me awayNow I know there's much more dignityIn defeat than in the brightest victoryI'm losing my balance on the tight ropeTell me please, tell me please, tell me please...If I ever feel betterRemind me to spend some good time with youYou can give me your numberWhen it's all over I'll let you knowHang on to the good daysI can lean on my friendsThey help me going through hard timesBut I'm feeding the enemyI'm in league with the foeBlame me for what's happeningI can't try, I can't try, I can't try...No one knows the hard times I went throughIf happiness came I miss the callThe stormy days ain't overI've tried and lost know I think that I pay the costNow I've watched all my castles fallThey were made of dust, after allSomeday all this mess will make me laughI can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait...If I ever feel betterRemind me to spend some good time with youYou can give me your numberWhen it's all over I'll let you knowIf I ever feel betterRemind me to spend some good time with youYou can give me your numberWhen it's all over I'll let you knowIt's like somebody took my placeI ain't even playing my own gameThe rules have changed well I didn't knowThere are things in my life I can't controlI feel the chaos around meA thing I don't try to denyI'd better learn to accept thatThere's a part of my life that will go awayDark is the night, cold is the groundIn the circular solitude of my heartAs one who strives a hill to climbI am sure I'll come through I don't know howThey say an end can be a startFeels like I've been buried yet I'm still aliveI'm losing my balance on the tight ropeTell me please, tell me please, tell me please...If I ever feel betterRemind me to spend some good time with youYou can give me your numberWhen it's all over I'll let you knowIf I ever feel betterRemind me to spend some good time with youYou can give me your numberWhen it's all over I'll let you knowIf I ever feel betterRemind me to spend some good time with youYou can give me your numberWhen it's all over I'll let you know
