Now it's day, I've been trying to get that taste off my tongueI was dreaming of just you, now our cereal, it is warmAttractive day in the rubble of the night from beforeNow I can't walk in a vacuum, I feel ugly, feel my poresIt's the trees of this day that I do battle with for the lightThen I start to feel trapped in, people greet me, I'm polite"What's the day? What's you doing? How's your mood? How's that song?"Man it passes right by me, it's behind me, now it's goneAnd I can't lift you up 'cause my mind is tiredIt's family beaches that I desireA sacred night, where we'll watch the fireworksThe frightened babies pooThey've got two flashing eyes and they're colored whyThey make me feel that I'm only all I see sometimesI was eating with a good friendWho said "A Genii made me out of the earth's skin"But in spite of her she is my birth kinShe spits me out in her surly blood riversAll the people life lurking in dominions of a hot Turk dishIf the elephants are reaching for our pursesThen meet me after the world with the shiversI was eating with a good friendWho said "A Genii made me out of the earth's skin"But in spite of her she is my birth kinShe spits me out in her surly blood riversAll the people life lurking in dominions of a hot Turk dishIf the elephants are reaching for our pursesThen meet me after the world with the shiversI was eating with a good friendWho said "A Genii made me out of the earth's skin"But in spite of her she is my birth kinShe spits me out in her surly blood riversAll the people life lurking in dominions of a hot Turk dishIf the elephants are reaching for our pursesThen meet me after the world with the shivers"What's the day? What's you doing? How's your food? How's that song?"Man it passes right by me, it's behind me, now it's goneAnd I can't lift you up 'cause my mind is tiredIt's family beaches that I desireThat sacred night where we watched the fireworksThey frightened the babies and you know they've got twoFlashing eyes and if they are color blindThey make me feel that you're only what I see sometimesAnd I can't lift you up 'cause my mind is tiredIt's family beaches that I desireThat sacred night where we watched the fireworksThey frightened the babies and you know they've got twoFlashing eyes and if they are color blindThey make me feel that I'm only all I see sometimes
