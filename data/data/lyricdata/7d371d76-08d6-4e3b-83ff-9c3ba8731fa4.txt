I've got to rearrange my life,I've got to rearrange my world.I miss you, I need you.I've got to keep my memories aside,I've got to try to live again.Time was, when there were things around,to be afraid of.I’d die ‘cause I couldn’t change my mindand turn the tables.Time was, when there was no need to stopand rearrange it.Now I've got a memory.And I don't want to change it.And there's a time for waking up,and feeling down.That’s when you have to pick your feetup from the ground.Time was, when I had you around,I was a strong man.I need you, to help me make the changeand be a new man.It takes more than a day and a night for giving.It's not so easy, to just change your way of living.Time was, when there were things around,that bothered me.The crime was, I couldn't startto change my history.
