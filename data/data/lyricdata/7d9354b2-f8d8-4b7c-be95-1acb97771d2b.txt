Grim-faced and forbiddingTheir faces closed tightAn angular mass of New YorkersPacing in rhythmRace the oncoming nightThey chase through the streets of ManhattanHead-first humanityPause at a lightThen flow through the streets of the cityThey seem obliviousTo a soft spring rainLike an English rainSo light, yet endlessFrom a leaden sky, yeahThe buildings are lostIn their limitless riseMy feet catch the pulseAnd the purposeful strideI feel the sense of possibilitiesI feel the wrench of hard realitiesThe focus is sharp in the cityWide-angle watcherOn life's ancient talesSteeped in the history of LondonGreen and grey washesIn the whispy white veilMist in the streets of WestminsterWistful and weatheredThe pride still prevailsAlive in the streets of the cityAre they obliviousTo this quality?A quality of lightUnique to every city's streets- "Hello"- "Morning, gov"Pavements may teemWith intense energyBut the city is calmIn this violent seaI feel the sense of possibilitiesI feel the wrench of hard realitiesThe focus is sharp in the city
