Once in a house on a hillA boy got angryHe broke into my heartFor a day and a nightI stayed beside himUntil I had no hopeSo I came down the hillOf course I was hurtBut then I started to thinkIt shouldn't hurt me to be freeIt's what I really needTo pull myself togetherBut if it's so good being freeWould you mind telling meWhy I don't know what to do with myselfThere's a bar by the dockWhere I found myselfDrinking with this manHe offered me a cigaretteAnd I accepted'Cause it's been a very long timeAs it burned 'till the endI thought of the boyNo one could ever forgetIt shouldn't hurt me to be freeIt's what I really needTo pull myself togetherBut if it's so good being freeWould you mind telling meWhy I don't know what to do with myselfTo pull myself togetherBut if it's so good being freeWould you mind telling meWhy I don't know what to do with myselfTo pull myself togetherBut if it's so good being freeWould you mind telling meWhy I don't know what to do with myself
