I was lying in my bed last nightStaring at a ceiling full of starsWhen it suddenly hit meI just have to let you know how I feelWe live together in a photograph of timeI look into your eyesAnd the seas open up to meI tell you I love youAnd I always willAnd I know that you can't tell meAnd I know that you can't tell meSo I'm left to pick upThe hints, the little symbols of your devotionSo I'm left to pick upThe hints, the little symbols of your devotionI feel your fistsAnd I know it's out of loveAnd I feel the whipAnd I know it's out of loveI feel your burning eyes burning holesStraight through my heartIt's out of loveIt's out of loveI accept and I collect upon my bodyThe memories of your devotionI accept and I collect upon my bodyThe memories of your devotionI feel your fistsAnd I know it's out of loveAnd I feel the whipAnd I know it's out of loveI feel your burning eyes burning holesStraight through my heartIt's out of loveIt's out of love...
