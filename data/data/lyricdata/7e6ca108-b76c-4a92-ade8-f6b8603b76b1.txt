Is it worth it, can you even hear me?Standing with your spotlight on meNot enough to feed the hungryI'm tired and I've felt it for a while nowIn this sea of lonelyThe taste of ink is getting oldIt's four o' clock in the fucking morningEach day gets more and more like the last dayStill I can see it comingWhile I'm standing in the river drowningThis could be my chance to break outThis could be my chance to say goodbyeAt last it's finally overCouldn't take this town much longerBeing half dead wasn't what I planned to beNow I'm ready to be freeSo here I am, it's in my handAnd I'll savor every moment of thisSo here I am, alive at lastAnd I'll savor every moment of thisAnd won't you think I'm prettyWhen I'm standing top the bright lit cityAnd I'll take your hand and pick you upAnd keep you there so you can seeAs long as you're alive and careI promise I will take you thereWe'll drink and dance the night away, drink and dance the night awaySo here I am, it's in my handAnd I'll savor every moment of thisSo here I am, alive at lastAnd I'll savor every moment of thisSavor every moment of thisAs long as you're aliveHere I amI promise I will take you thereAs long as you're aliveHere I amI promise I will take you thereAnd won't you think I'm prettyWhen I'm standing top the bright lit cityAnd I'll take your hand and pick you upAnd keep you there so you can see itAs long as you're alive and careI promise I will take you thereAs long as you're alive and careI promise I will take you thereSo here I am, it's in my handAnd I'll savor every moment of thisSo here I am, alive at lastAnd I'll savor every moment of thisSavor every moment of thisSavor every moment of thisSavor every moment of this
