You toss in a wordAnd I'm your villainI see the passion emergeAnd I'm your villainBut serious, you're so seriousLike a waiter hating the rich, but taking their tipsAnd if I could laugh I'd love youAnd if i could smile at anything you saidWe could be laughing loversI think you'd prefer to be miserable insteadIf I could laugh I'd love youIf I could love like anybody elseI know what I amAnd I'm your villainI don't give a damn ifI'm your villainBecause seriousYou're so seriousBut I've got ready saltedready on your bellyIf you want to have funSee you later, baby see you later x8Alright!
