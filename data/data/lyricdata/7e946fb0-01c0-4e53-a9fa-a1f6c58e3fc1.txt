You toss in a word And I'm your villain I see the passion emerge And I'm your villain But serious, you're so serious Like a waiter hating the rich, but taking their tips And if I could laugh I'd love you And if i could smile at anything you said We could be laughing lovers I think you'd prefer to be miserable instead If I could laugh I'd love you If I could love like anybody else I know what I am And I'm your villain I don't give a damn if I'm your villain Because serious You're so serious But I've got ready saltedready on your belly If you want to have fun See you later, baby see you later x8 Alright!
