Like most babies smell like butterHis smell smelled like no otherHe was born scentless and senselessHe was born a scentless apprenticeAwayGo away, go awayEvery wet nurse refused to feed himElectrolytes smell like semenI promise not to sell your perfumed secretsThere are countless formulas for pressing flowersAwayGo away, go awayI lie in the soil and fertilize mushroomsLeaking the gas we'll make into perfumeYou can't fire me because I quit!Throw me in the fire and I won't throw a fitHey, go awayGo away, go awayGo away, go awayGo away, go away
