I spy something beginning with 's'On candy stripe legs, the spiderman comesSoftly through the shadow of the evening sunStealing past the windows of the blissfully deadLooking for the victim, shivering in bedSearching out fear in the gathering gloomAnd suddenly, a movement in the corner of the roomAnd there is nothing I can do, and I realize with frightThat the spiderman is having me for dinner tonightQuietly he laughs, shaking his headCreeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bedAnd softer than shadow and quicker than fliesHis arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes"Be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boyDon't struggle like that or I will only love you moreFor it's much too late to get away or turn on the lightThe spiderman is having you for dinner tonight"And I feel like I'm being eatenBy a thousand million shivering furry holesAnd I know that in the morning I will wake up in the shivering coldAnd the spiderman is always hungry"Come into my parlour" said the spider to the fly"I have something"
