I had seven facesThought I knew which one to wearI'm sick of spending these lonely nightsTraining myself not to careThe subway is a pornoThe pavements, they are a messI know you've supported me for a long timeSomehow I'm not impressedBut New York caresNew York caresNew York caresNew York caresSubway, she is a pornoAnd the pavements they are a messI know you've supported me for a long timeSomehow I'm not impressedIt's up to me nowTurn on the bright lightsOh, it's up to me nowTurn on the bright lightsNew York caresNew York caresNew York caresNew York caresIt's up to me nowTurn on the bright lightsOh, it's up to me nowTurn on the bright lights
