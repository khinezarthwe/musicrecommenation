I had seven faces Thought I knew which one to wear I'm sick of spending these lonely nights Training myself not to care The subway is a porno The pavements, they are a mess I know you've supported me for a long time Somehow I'm not impressed But New York cares New York cares New York cares New York cares Subway, she is a porno And the pavements they are a mess I know you've supported me for a long time Somehow I'm not impressed It's up to me now Turn on the bright lights Oh, it's up to me now Turn on the bright lights New York cares New York cares New York cares New York cares It's up to me now Turn on the bright lights Oh, it's up to me now Turn on the bright lights
