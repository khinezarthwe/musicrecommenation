We've come a long way to where the mountain is highI take my cedar to where the mountain is highWhat I need is a peace and quietWhat we see is an illusionI have no reason to confuse themI have no reason to confuse my brothersThey have real shotgunsThey were baby killersBut I warned you many times that they will burn down your houseNot today (what can I do)Not today (to make it better)What we need is a persuasionWhat you give is retaliationI hope one day we meet againI hope one day we love one anotherThey were young soldiersThey were old liarsBut I heard the rumor that they will burn down your houseNot today (what can I do)Not today (to make it better)They will burn down your houseThey will burn down your house
