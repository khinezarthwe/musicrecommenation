In my room she'll get to youIn my room she'll get to youIn my roomCould I turn on the lie?Inpress your unknown eyesHumour absorbs the thoughtsChallenge emotionless thoughtsSeeing things with a second glanceAs she turns through her magazinesIn my room she'll get to youIn my room she'll get to youIn my roomCould I turn on the lie?Inpress unknown eyesHumour absorbs the thoughtsLift up your snorting headsPlayed like dancing foolsTurning the tension roundBuilding up silent soundsJust another dayOh, in my roomStruck out like beforeOh, in my roomRoomRoomRoomRoom
