In my room she'll get to you In my room she'll get to you In my room Could I turn on the lie? Inpress your unknown eyes Humour absorbs the thoughts Challenge emotionless thoughts Seeing things with a second glance As she turns through her magazines In my room she'll get to you In my room she'll get to you In my room Could I turn on the lie? Inpress unknown eyes Humour absorbs the thoughts Lift up your snorting heads Played like dancing fools Turning the tension round Building up silent sounds Just another day Oh, in my room Struck out like before Oh, in my room Room Room Room Room
