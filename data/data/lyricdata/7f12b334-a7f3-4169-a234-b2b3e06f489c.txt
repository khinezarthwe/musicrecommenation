Penniless and tired with your hair grown longI was looking at you there and your face looked wrongMemory is a fickle siren songI didn't understandIn the gentle light as the morning nearsYou don't say a single word of the last two yearsWhere you were or when you reached the frontierI didn't understand, noSee your rugged hands and a silver knifeTwenty dollars in your hand that you hold so tightAll the evidence of your vagrant lifeMy brother, you were goneAnd you will try to do what you did beforePull the wool over your eyes for a week or moreLet your family take you back to yourOriginal mindThere's nothing I can doThere's nothing I can doThere's nothing I can sayThere's nothing I can sayI can say
