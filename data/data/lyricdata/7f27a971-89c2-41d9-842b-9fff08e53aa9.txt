How i tried to catch you while you ran ahead of meI lassoed mars to see if you were hiding thereBut you'd already ran past Jupiter to Pluto's moonAnd my rope won't reach that moonThis is a state of electrical shockYou were so beautiful i thought you'd last foreverBut you came and you went when the lights went outYou went like you cameIn a lightning boltWhy did you go like thisI slam against the wallIt's crushing my skullWhy did you go like thisI slam against the wall of permanenceAnd like a ghost i am spinningIn circles the dance of Pluto's moon
