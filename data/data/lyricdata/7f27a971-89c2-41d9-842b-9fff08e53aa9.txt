How i tried to catch you while you ran ahead of me I lassoed mars to see if you were hiding there But you'd already ran past Jupiter to Pluto's moon And my rope won't reach that moon This is a state of electrical shock You were so beautiful i thought you'd last forever But you came and you went when the lights went out You went like you came In a lightning bolt Why did you go like this I slam against the wall It's crushing my skull Why did you go like this I slam against the wall of permanence And like a ghost i am spinning In circles the dance of Pluto's moon
