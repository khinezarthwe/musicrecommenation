3,5,0,1,2,5, Go!I was there in the back stageWhen first light came aroundI grew up like a changelingTo win the first time aroundI can see all the weaknessI can pick all the faultsWell, I concede all the faith testsJust to stick in your throats3 1 g, 3 1 g, 3 1 gI hung around in your soundtrackTo mirror all that you've doneTo find the right side of reasonTo kill the three lies for oneI can see all the cold factsI can see through your eyesAll this talk made no contactNo matter how hard we tried3 1 g, 3 1 g, 3 1 gI can still hear the footstepsI can only see wallsI slid into your man-trapsWith no hearing at allI just see contradictionHad to give up the fightJust to live in the past tenseTo make believe you were right3 1 g, 3 1 g, 3 1 g3,5,0,1,2,5
