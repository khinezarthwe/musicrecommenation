Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train When I's feelin' near as faded as my jeans Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained And rode us all the way into New Orleans I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana I's playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues Windshield wipers slappin' time I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine We sang every song that driver knew Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose Nothin', it ain't nothin' honey, if it ain't free And feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues You know feelin' good was good enough for me Good enough for me and my Bobby Mc Gee From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun Yeah, Bobby shared the secrets of my soul Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away He's lookin' for that home and I hope he finds it But I'd trade all my tomorrows for one single yesterday To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose Nothin', and that's all that Bobby left me Well feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues And feelin' good was good enough for me Good enough for me and my Bobby Mc Gee, yeah La da da, la da daa, la da daa da daa da daa La da da da daa dadada Bobby Mc Gee-ah La li daa da daa daa, la da daa da daa La la laa la daada Bobby Mc Gee-ah yeah La di da, ladida L A dida L A di daa, ladida L A dida L A di daa Hey now Bobby now now Bobby Mc Gee yeah Lo lo L O lolo L O lo laa, Lololo L O lolo L O lolo L O lolo L O la laa Hey now Bobby now now Bobby Mc Gee yeah Lord, I called him my lover, I called him my man I said I called him my lover, did the best I can C'mon, hey now Bobby now, hey now Bobby Mc Gee, yeah Lo lo Lord, a Lord, a Lord, a Lord, a Lord, a Lord, a Lord, oh Hey, hey, hey, Bobby Mc Gee, Lord Lo lo Lord, a Lord, a Lord, a Lord, a Lord, a Lord, a Lord, oh Hey, hey, hey, Bobby Mc Gee, Lord
