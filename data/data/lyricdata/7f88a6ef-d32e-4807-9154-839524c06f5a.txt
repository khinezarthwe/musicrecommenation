I'm on the corner, waiting for a light to come onThat's when I know that you're aloneIt's cold in the desert, water never sees the groundSpecial unspoken without soundTold me you loved me, that I'd never die aloneHand over your heart, let's go homeEveryone noticed, everyone has seen the signsI've always been known to cross linesI've never ever cried when I was feeling downI've always been scared of the soundJesus don't love me, no one ever carried my loadI'm too young to feel this oldIs it you? Is it me?Or does nobody know, nobody seeNobody but meAhh, oh
