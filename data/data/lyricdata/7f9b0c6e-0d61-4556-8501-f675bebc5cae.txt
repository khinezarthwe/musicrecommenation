We can reach the sea, they won't follow me Shadows they fear the sun, we'll make it if we run Run from the memory, je nage, mais les sons me suivent Left my name with the border guards, a name that I don't need Ce sera un long voyage, sur les vagues de l'oubli Run from the memory, je nage, mais les sons me suivent Please stop now before it's too late Been eating in the ghetto on a hundred dollar plate Nothing lasts forever, that's the way it's gotta be There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea for me Stop now before it's too late Been eating in the ghetto on a hundred dollar plate Nothing lasts forever, that's the way it's gotta be There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea for me For you, for me, it's always for you Stop now before it's too late Been eating in the ghetto on a hundred dollar plate Nothing lasts forever, that's the way it's gotta be There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea for Stop now before it's too late Your lover was for hire, have you noticed he's been late? Nothing lasts forever, that's the way it's gotta be There's a great black wave in the middle of the sea for me For you, for me, it's always for you The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet The sound is not asleep, it's moving under my feet
