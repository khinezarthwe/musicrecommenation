I want in like a substituteI've been working awful hard for youBut you don't say, you just hold your breathSo I can't touch what I haven't yetShe's a cold one and it hurts me soIt's a dark path and a heck of a tollAnd she could kill me just like she did beforeWe'd be so freeSharing a smileSo far from homePushing and a pulling weightIt's the hard part but the true love wayGirl, you're wanted like a wanted manWith your smart mouth and your killer handWe could both share all that I have madeFor a young man, it's a heck of a wageAnd I feel crazy when I see your face'Cause we'd be so freeHappy aloneSharing a smileSo far from homeAnd we would laughLaugh till we cryMaking up songsYou're making me lieAnd people say our babies are walking this townAnd people say our babies are walking this townAnd people say our babies, they're just wandering aroundAnd people say our babies, they're walkingWe'd be so freeHappy aloneSharing a smileSo far from homeAnd we would laughLaugh till we cryMaking up songsYou're making me lieHappy alone
