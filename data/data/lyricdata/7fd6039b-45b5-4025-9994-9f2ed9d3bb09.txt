Excuse me sir, I'm lost I'm looking for a place where I can get lost I'm looking for a hope for my malfunctioning being I'm looking for the mechanical music museum This is a warning, a spelling out for you, for you Excuse me miss, I'm a dog on heat I'm a complicated being with love songs to hear I'm a poor starving baby who can march all night I'm a mechanical music man and I'm starting a fight Hot Chip will break your legs, snap off your head Hot Chip will put you down, under the ground Excuse me child, I am trying to see all the colors of wonder your brightness can be Return to nothingness and joy just might be right But prepare yourself for a mechanical fright This is a warning, a spelling out for you, for you This is a warning, a spelling out for you, for you Hot Chip will break your legs, snap off your head Hot Chip will put you down, under the ground Excuse me son, I'm found I'm looking for a place where I was once found There's nothing in a world where the melody's broken There's always some way to make a silence be spoken Hot Chip will break your legs, snap off your head Hot Chip will put you down, under the ground
