O Green World,Don't desert me nowBring me back to fallen townWhere someone is still aliveFighting for something new in thisWhen no one needs the heart of me and I'llGet out somewhere other than me before...(than me before...)O Green WorldDon't desert me nowI'm made of you and you of meBut where are we?Oh noSells to liefrom the darkest starsSuppose youDown when you're in fastCause it seems so little to youBut I know you now, I knowYou know, me tooYou know, me tooI hope sex and drugs rust into my selfHoly, it feels, holyIt feels like you're with your father in the place you love...
