Say hey, cha...Hear the sound of the falling rainComing down like an Armageddon flameThe shame, the ones who died without a nameHear the dogs howling out of keyTo a hymn called "Faith and Misery"And bleed, the company lost the war todayI beg to dream and differ from the hollow liesThis is the dawning of the rest of our livesOn holidayHear the drum pounding out of timeAnother protester has crossed the lineTo find the money's on the other sideCan I get another amen?There's a flag wrapped around a score of menA gag, a plastic bag on a monumentI beg to dream and differ from the hollow liesThis is the dawning of the rest of our livesOn holiday!The representative from California has the floor..."Zieg Heil" to the president gasmanBombs away is your punishmentPulverize the Eiffel TowersWho criticize your governmentBang bang, goes the broken glass andKill all the fags that don't agreeTrials by fire setting fireIs not a way that's meant for meJust 'causeJust 'cause, because we're outlaws, yeah!I beg to dream and differ from the hollow liesThis is the dawning of the rest of our livesI beg to dream and differ from the hollow liesThis is the dawning of the rest of our livesThis is our lives on holiday!
