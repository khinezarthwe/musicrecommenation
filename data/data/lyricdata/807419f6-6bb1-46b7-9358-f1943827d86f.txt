Twenty years it's breaking you down,now that you understand there's no one around.Take a breath, just take a seat,you're falling apart and tearing at the seams.Heaven forbid you end up alone and don't know whyHold on tight wait for tomorrow, you'll be alrightIt's on your face, is it on your mind,Would you care to build a house of your own?How much longer,How long can you wait?It's like you wanted to go and give yourself away.Heaven forbid you end up alone and don't know whyHold on tight wait for tomorrow, you'll be alrightHeaven forbid you end up alone and don't know whyHold on tight wait for tomorrow, you'll be alrightIt feels good.(Is that reason enough for you?)It feels good.(Is that reason enough for you?)It feels good.(Is that reason enough for you?)It feels good.Heaven forbid you end up alone and don't know whyHold on tight wait for tomorrow, you'll be alrightHeaven forbid you end up alone and don't know whyHold on tight wait for tomorrow, you'll be alrightHeaven forbid you end up alone and don't know whyHold on tight wait for tomorrow, you'll be alrightHeaven forbid you end up alone and don't know whyHold on tight wait for tomorrow, you'll be alrightOut of this oneI don't know how to get you out of this one,I don't know how to get you out of this one,Don't know how to get you out of this one,I don't know how to get you out of this one,Out of this one.
