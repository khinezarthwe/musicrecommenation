Routine was the themeHe'd wake up, wash and pour himself into uniformSomething he hadn't imagined beingAs the merging traffic passedHe found himself staring downAt his own handsNot remembering the changeNot recalling the planWas it?He was okayBut wonderingAbout wanderingWas it age?By consequence?Or was he moved by sleight of hand?Mondays were made to fallLost on a road he knew by heartIt was like a book he read in his sleepEndlesslySometimes he hid in his radioWatching others pull into their homesWhile he was driftingOn a lineOf his ownOff the lineOff the sideBy the byAs dirt turned to sandAs if moved by sleight of handAnd when he reached the shore of his clip-on worldHe resurfaced to the normOrganized his few things, his coat and keysAny new realizations would have to waitTill he had more timeMore timeA time to dreamTo himselfHe waves goodbyeTo himselfI'll see you on the other sideAnother man moved by sleight of hand
