It's only been a week The rush of being home in rapid fading Prevailing to recall What I was missing all that time in England Has sent me aimlessly On foot or by the help of transportation To knock on windows where A friend no longer live, I had forgotten And everywhere I go There's always something to remind me Of another place and time Where love that travelled far had found me We stayed outside till two Waiting for the light to come back We didn't talk I knew Until you asked what I was thinking Until you asked what I was thinking Brave men tell the truth The wise man's tools are analogies and puzzles A woman holds her tongue Knowing silence will speak for her So now I'll never know As you no longer sleep beside me, and everywhere I go Will remind, will remind, will remind me Will remind, will remind, will remind me Will remind, will remind, will remind me Will remind, will remind, will remind me Will remind, will remind, will remind me Will remind, will remind, will remind me Will remind, will remind, will remind me Will remind, will remind, will remind me It's only been a week The rush of being home in rapid fading Prevailing to recall What I was missing all that time in England Has sent me aimlessly On foot or by the help of transportation To knock on windows where A friend no longer live, I had forgotten Will remind, will remind, will remind me Will remind, will remind, will remind me Will remind, will remind, will remind me Will remind, will remind, will remind me
