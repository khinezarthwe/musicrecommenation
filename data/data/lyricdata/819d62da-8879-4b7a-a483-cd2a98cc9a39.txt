Backwards, forwards but making no ground at allStanding in the city with the clocks counting oneAnd your face is still wet from the fight beforeAs your tears hit the ground, blue flowers spring from themBaby, I'm ashamed of the things I put you throughBaby, I'm ashamed of the man I was for youAnd all you said in your quietest voiceWas, "I needed you as much as they do"And all you said in your quietest voiceWas, "I needed you as much as they do"How fast must we run before we can just take off in flight?How far must we run before they do not recognise us?So let's take this from the start, you'll be me and I'll be youAnd let's try not to complain about your smokingAnd my distant heart, and my distant heartAnd my distant heartAnd all you said in your quietest voiceWas, "I needed you as much as they do"And all you said in your quietest voiceWas, "I needed you as much as they do"(Too many mirrors in this house)(And I don't like to see myself like this)(I'm becoming the man I used to be, I guess)(These walls could tell you a thing or two)(Things that you really don't want to know)(Lend me your eyes for your point of view)(Lend me your feet and I'll stand by you)And all you said in your quietest voiceWas, "I needed you as much as they do"And all you said in your quietest voiceWas, "I needed you as much as they do"
