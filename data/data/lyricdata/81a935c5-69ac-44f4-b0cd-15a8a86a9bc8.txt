All these visions in my headShould have gone to bed before the watershedSome are alive some are deadMakes no difference when they're in your headKeep the door open a crackSo I can see them when they attackSome are whiteSome are blackMakes no difference when they're on your backAnd I can't stop cryingAnd I can't stop driving'Cause the day is dying dying dyingAnd my eyes wide openCount the sheep jumping the fenceSo I can see tee pees when I'm feeling tentsDisbelief hung in suspenseEiderdown is my own defenseAnd I can't stop cryingAnd I can't stop driving'Cause the day is dying dying dyingAnd my eyes wide openAll these visions in my headShould have gone to bed before the watershedSome are aliveSome are deadMakes no difference when they're in your headAnd I can't stop cryingAnd I can't stop driving'Cause the day is dying dying dyingAnd my eyes wide open
