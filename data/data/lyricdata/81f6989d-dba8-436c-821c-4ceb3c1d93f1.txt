Know a manHis face seems pulled and tenseLike he's riding on a motorbikeIn the strongest windsSo I approach with tactSuggest that he should relaxBut he's always movingMuch too fastSaid he'll see me on the flip sideOn this trip he's taking for a rideHe's been taking too much onThere he goes with his perfectly unkempt clothesThere he goes...He's yet to come backBut I've seen his pictureIt doesn't look the sameUp on the rackWe go way backI wonder about his insidesIt's like his thoughts are too big for his sizeHe's been takenWhere I don't knowOff he goes with his perfectly unkempt clothesThere he goesAnd now I rub my eyesFor he has returnedSeems my preconceptions are what should have been burnedFor he still smilesAnd he's still strongNothing's changed but the surrounding bullshitThat has grownAnd now he's homeAnd we're laughing like we always didMy same oldSame old friendUntil a quarter-to-tenI saw the strain creep inHe seems distractedAnd I know just what is going to happen thenBefore his first stepHe is off again
