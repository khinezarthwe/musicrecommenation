Hang my picture Cut my tree Swallow the forest Let's surround it Leap from the mountain Fall to the sea Hanging from coattails And following me Well, I have held on to many ghosts Many ghosts, many ghosts To tell my story And I have held on to many ghosts Many ghosts, many ghosts To tell my story It goes like this Back and forth all day It goes like this, kid Back and forth all day Read my story Buzz my beak Holding the mason jar And caressing me The feels of the sky They breeze when I breathe Reading from books Empty boxes marked "free" Well, I have held on to many ghosts Many ghosts, many ghosts To tell my story And I have held on to many ghosts Many ghosts, many ghosts To tell my story It goes like this Back and forth all day It goes like this, kid Back and forth all day
