I am a hippy's sonI'm into porn and gunsI'm virile fertileScream when I comeRelated to you allBy six degreesI am a fire signI've never swum with the tideSpreading honey on thornsAnd truths that rhymeMy stories are all tallBut it's so obviousIt's bloody outrageousThey try and they try but they'll just never save usHush hush my loveCome fall into these armsHush hush my loveCome fall into my armsHush hush my loveI am my father's sonI'll kick your teeth in and runA bulldog blinded by rainbows and sunRelated to you allI think you will agreeNaked to you allBut it's so obviousIt's bloody outrageousThey try and they try but they'll just never save usHush hush my loveCome fall into these armsHush hush my loveCome fall into my armsHush hush my loveI was your baby boyI was designed to destroyPrimal klaxon at fascist's tannoyI am a hippy's sonI am a hippy's sonI am a hippy's sonI am a hippy's son
