I used up your compassionSo I've come to make a tradeYou can hate me but just love me in returnAnd if I know where to find youI'll stay out of your wayI won't come beg to borrow all the happiness you've earnedI'll just slide back down to the bottomWhile you make your place in the hillsThere's nothing that the road cannot healThere's nothing that the road cannot healWashed under the blacktopGone beneath my wheelsThere's nothing that the road cannot healClaro que siThey say the sun won't burn foreverBut that's a science too exactI can prove it, watch, we're crossing the state lineSee those headlights coming towards usThat's someone going backTo a town they said they'd never, yeah, they swore it on their lifeBut you can't break out of a circleThat you never knew you were inThere's nothing that the road cannot healThere's nothing that the road cannot healWashed under the blacktopGone beneath my wheelsThere's nothing that the road cannot healSome would spend their precious timeTrying to decorate their livesTaking measurements for some new look they wantSo from one to ten, ten's exactly what I amZero being everything I'm notTell me what you likeIs it less than fiveIs it less than fiveThere's nothing that the road cannot healThere's nothing that the road cannot healWhen I make it to MoabI'll get my canteen filledThere's nothing that the road cannot healWashed under the blacktopGone beneath my wheelsThere's nothing that the road cannot heal
