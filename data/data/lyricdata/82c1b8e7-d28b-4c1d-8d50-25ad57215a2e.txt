Feel the funk blast Feel the funk blast Feel the funk blast Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo I be walkin' god like a dog My narrative, fearless My word war returns to burn Like Baldwin home from Paris Like steel from a furnace I was born landless This is the native son Born of Zapata's guns Stroll through the shanties And the cities' remains Same bodies buried hungry But with different last names These vultures robbin' everything Leave nothing but chains They pick a point on the globe Yes, the pictures the same There's a bank, there's a church A myth and a hearse A mall and a loan A child dead at birth There's a widow pig parrot A rebel to tame A white hooded judge A syringe and a vein And the riot be the rhyme of the unheard Whatcha say, whatcha say, whatcha say, what Whatcha say, whatcha say, whatcha say, what Whatcha say, whatcha say, whatcha say, what Whatcha say, whatcha say, whatcha say, what Calm like a bomb Calm like a bomb This ain't subliminal Feel the critical mass approach horizon The pulse of the condemned Sound off America's demisin' The anti-myth rhythm rock shocker Yes I spit fire Hope lies in the smoldering rubble of empires Yes, back through the shanties And the cities' remains The same bodies buried hungry But with different last names The vultures robbin' everyone Left nothing but chains Pick a point here at home Yet the picture's the same There's a field full of slaves Some corn and some debt There's a ditch full of bodies The check for the rent There's a tap, the phone The silence of stone The numb black screen That be feelin' like home And the riot be the rhyme of the unheard Whatcha say, whatcha say, whatcha say, what Whatcha say, whatcha say, whatcha say, what Whatcha say, whatcha say, whatcha say, what Whatcha say, whatcha say, whatcha say, what Calm like a bomb Calm like a bomb Calm like a bomb Calm like a bomb Calm like a bomb Calm like a bomb Calm like a bomb Calm like a bomb Calm like a bomb There's a mass without roofs, a prison to fill There's a country's soul that reads, There's a strike and a line of cops outside of the mill There's a right to obey and a right to kill There's a mass without roofs, there's a prison to fill There's a country's soul that reads, There's a strike and a line of cops outside of the mill There's a right to obey and there's the right to kill
