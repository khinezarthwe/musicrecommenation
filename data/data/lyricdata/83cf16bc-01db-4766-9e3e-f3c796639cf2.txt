Two jumps in a weekI bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy?Flying on your motorcycleWatching all the ground beneath you dropYou'd kill yourself for recognitionKill yourself to never ever stopYou broke another mirrorYou're turning into something you are notDon't leave me highDon't leave me dryDon't leave me highDon't leave me dryDrying up in conversationYou will be the one who cannot talkAll your insides fall to piecesYou just sit there wishing you could still make loveThey're the ones who'll hate youWhen you think you've got the world all sussed outThey're the ones who'll spit at youYou will be the one screaming outDon't leave me highDon't leave me dryDon't leave me highDon't leave me dryIt's the best thing that you ever hadThe best thing that you ever, ever hadIt's the best thing that you ever hadThe best thing you have had has gone awayDon't leave me highDon't leave me dryDon't leave me highDon't leave me dryDon't leave me highDon't leave me highDon't leave me dry
