(Coverdale/Moody/Marsden/Murray/Dowle)You're taking a walk on the wild sideIf you're gonna take a chance with me,I'm gonna make you take a look on the insideAnd you might not like what you seeSo don't you knock on my doorIf you don't want an answerOr gimme a beatIf you don't want a dancerI've got my love gun loaded,I've got you in my sight,I never take no for an answer,So you'd better say yes tonightI told you the scoreRight from the start,You'll never get to heavenIf you break my heartSo if you don't mean businessKnock on someone else's door,'Cos it's a mean mean businessStaying alive if you fool with meYou say you want my money,I say you've got no sense,If you just want to bleed me dryStay on your side of the fenceNo mercy you can see'Cos seven to eleven made a fool out of meSo if you don't mean businessKnock on someone else's door,'Cos it's a mean mean businessStaying alive if you fool with meYou're taking a walk on the wild sideIf you're gonna take a chance with me,I'm gonna make you take a look on the insideAnd you might not like what you seeSo don't you knock on my doorIf you don't want an answerOr gimme a beatIf you don't want a dancerSo if you don't mean businessKnock on someone else's door,'Cos it's a mean mean businessStaying alive if you fool with me...
