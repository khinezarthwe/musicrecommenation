Kiss me goodbyePushing out before I sleepCan't you see I try?Swimming the same deep water as you is hard"The shallow drowned lose less than we" you breatheThe strangest twist upon your lips"And we shall be together""Kiss me goodbyeBow your head and join with me"And face pushed deep, reflections meetThe strangest twist upon your lipsAnd disappear, the ripples clearAnd laughing break against your feetAnd laughing break the mirror sweet"So we shall be together""Kiss me goodbye"Pushing out before I sleepIt's lower now and slower nowThe strangest twist upon your lipsBut I don't see and I don't feelBut tightly hold up silentlyMy hands before my fading eyesAnd in my eyes, your smileThe very last thing before I goThe very last thing before I goThe very last thing before I goI will kiss youI will kiss youI will kiss you forever on nights like thisI will kiss youI will kiss youAnd we shall be together
