So called Mr. Rock'n'roll is dancing on his own againTalking on his phone again to someone who tells him that his balance is lowHe's got nowhere to goHe's on his own againRock chick of the century is acting like she used to beDancing like there's no-one there before she never seemed to careNow she wouldn't dareIt's so rock and roll to be aloneAnd they'll meet one day far awayAnd say: "I wish I was something more"And they'll meet one day far awayAnd say: "I wish I knew you, I wish I knew you before"Mrs. Black and White, she's never seen a shade of greyAlways something on her mind, every single dayBut now she's lost her wayAnd where does she go from here?Mr Multicultural sees all that one can seeHe's living proof of someone very different to meBut now he wants to be freeFree so he can seeAnd they'll meet one day far awayAnd say: "I wish I was something more"And they'll meet one day far awayAnd say: "I wish I knew you, I wish I knew you before"He says: "I wish I knew you, I wish I met youWhen time was still on my side"She'll say: "I wish I knew you, I wish I loved youBefore I was his bride"And so they must depart, too many more are broken heartsBut I've seen that all before in TV, books and film and moreAnd there's a happy endingEvery single dayAnd they'll meet one day far awayAnd say: "I wish I was something more"And they'll meet one day far awayAnd say: "I wish I knew you, I wish I knew you before"
