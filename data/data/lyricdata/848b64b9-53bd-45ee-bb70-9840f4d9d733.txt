It's late in the night, dancing is doneThe music has died, you're ready to runBut you don't have a clue, this party hasn't ended yetNot for me and you, now you're just pretendingYou're hiding from yourselfYes you are, yes you areLike golden rays of sun in the cloudWe're meant to be one, I know we areIf I am the sky, then you are my starHey you don't have a clue, this party never endedNot for me and you, I know you're just pretendingYou're hiding from yourselfYes you are, yes you areLike golden rays of sun in the cloudI will make you seeHaven't you got, haven't you got it yet?Just lay down for a while, next to meDidn't mean to make you panicI didn't mean to put you offBaby it's the way that you've got meI listen to my heart and it takes you highAnd you ask me howCan I show you howI need your love right now, now, now
