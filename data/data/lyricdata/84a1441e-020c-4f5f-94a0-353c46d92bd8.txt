Thank you once again I can barely get through it I can't draw a linewithout it falling off the page And I can't hold a face Without it moving from the frame' Cause there's a tremor in my lipsand an itching in my eyes It's all 'cause of you So take the covers off They been keeping off the dust Steady down the arms Hold then sudden cut I see you in the dark See you dancing with the lights Copying your breath Tracing so you knowthat it's all 'cause of you Hole, follow from the wire Where it goes Somewhere down the hall In through your hands Out your mouth In a whisper In through the walls Where you start Tell me what's the time And how far left to go' Cause all these dirty blinds Keep us way to slow So baby let it out Let it burn into the sky Watch it as it goes Say you trust me then I know That is all 'cause of you
