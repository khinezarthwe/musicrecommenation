Thank you once againI can barely get through itI can't draw a linewithout it falling off the pageAnd I can't hold a faceWithout it moving from the frame'Cause there's a tremor in my lipsand an itching in my eyesIt's all 'cause of youSo take the covers offThey been keeping off the dustSteady down the armsHold then sudden cutI see you in the darkSee you dancing with the lightsCopying your breathTracing so you knowthat it's all 'cause of youHole, follow from the wireWhere it goesSomewhere down the hallIn through your handsOut your mouthIn a whisperIn through the wallsWhere you startTell me what's the timeAnd how far left to go'Cause all these dirty blindsKeep us way to slowSo baby let it outLet it burn into the skyWatch it as it goesSay you trust me then I knowThat is all 'cause of you
