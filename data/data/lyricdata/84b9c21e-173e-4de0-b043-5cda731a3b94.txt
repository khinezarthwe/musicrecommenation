I see a red door and I want it painted blackNo colours anymore, I want them to turn blackI see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothesI have to turn my head until my darkness goesI see a line of cars and they're all painted blackWith flowers and my love both never to come backI see people turn their heads and quickly look awayLike a newborn baby, it just happens every dayI look inside myself and see my heart is blackI see my red door and must have it painted blackMaybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the factsIt's not easy facin' up when your whole world is blackNo more will my green sea go turn a deeper blueI could not foresee this thing happening to youIf I look hard enough into the settin' sunMy love will laugh with me before the mornin' comesI see a red door and I want it painted blackNo colours anymore, I want them to turn blackI see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothesI have to turn my head until my darkness goesHmm...I wanna see your face painted blackBlack as night, black as coalI wanna see the sun blotted out from the skyI wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black, yeah!Hmm...
