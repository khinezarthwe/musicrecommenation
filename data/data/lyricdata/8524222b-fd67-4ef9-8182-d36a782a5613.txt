In the beginningBack in 1955Man didn't know 'bout a rock 'n' roll showAnd all that jiveThe white man had the schmaltzThe black man had the bluesNo one knew what they was gonna doBut Tchaikovsky had the news, he saidLet there be sound, and there was soundLet there be light, and there was lightLet there be drums, there was drumsLet there be guitar, there was guitarLet there be rockAnd it came to passThat rock 'n' roll was bornAll across the land every rockin' bandWas blowin' up a stormAnd the guitar man got famousThe business man got richAnd in every bar there was a superstarWith a seven year itchThere was fifteen million fingersLearnin' how to playAnd you could hear the fingers pickin'And this is what they had to sayLet there be light, sound, drums, guitarOh, let there be rockOne night in a club called the Shakin' HandThere was a 42 decibel rockin' bandAnd the music was good and the music was loudAnd the singer turned and he said to the crowd:"Let there be rock"
