All the lights we wereAll the lights we wereAll the lights we wereAll the lights we wereDo you rememberHow they need some fruit and sweet heartTo come a time, some time we spent(I cried for we when all was to come freeAt the broken heart in the room)Split your tongue down the semi kindAnd show us lovers that don't love to liveLick the kill that never didEat the trees and then get off on timeGet us something with the finger kids(I want it)Put your teeth where you love to loveDrink some spit just to save your lifeBury parents in a moments timeHate it all and you still use shampooYou hate it all and you still use shampooFind some bullets in a backyardShoot them up with your favourite kidFree them up like its another knifeSave them for when you thought you didSeen the tricks all use shampooYou hate it allMy daddy told me to get a lifeLike the something of simple timeIt tastes so goodI've seen your dreams and I wish you wouldI've seen your choice and it don't taste so goodSucks the jaws and they won't taste so goodI've seen your drugs and the don't look so goodSuck the jaws like I wish you would
