Hover through the foggy vapours,Until I see you in a dream,Singing animals to sleep...By the way, it's over without you.I'm in the way, I'm in the way,I'm in the way, I'm in the way.Lights out 'till midnight.Sleep all day(Yeah, yeah, yeah)(Sha la la la)Dark and quiet, only the owls are watching,Only the sky is up and I'm leaving for a place(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)From another time, just to be near you, just to be near you, just to be near you(Sha la la la la la la la la..)I'm in the way, I'm in the way.I'm in the way, I'm in the way, I'm in the way.I'm in the way, I'm in the way...Don't become the one you hated,Death is absolutely safe.A billion bibles mark the last page.I've gotta' roll through the days without you hereI get a shock, shock hurts to healI've gotta' roll through the weeks without you hereI get a shock, shock hurts to healI've gotta' roll through the months without you hereI get a shock, shock hurts to healI've gotta' roll through the weeks without you here,I get a shock, shock hurts to healI've gotta' roll through the weeks without you here...Shock hurts to healHurts to healHurts to healHurts to healHurts to healHurts to healHurts to heal
