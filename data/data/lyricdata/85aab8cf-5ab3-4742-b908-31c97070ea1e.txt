Sitting in the dark I can't forgetEven now, I realize the time I'll never getAnother story of the bitter pills of fateI can't go back again, I can't go back againBut you asked me to love you and I didTraded my emotions for a contract to commitAnd when I got away I only got so farThe other me is dead. I hear his voice inside my headWe were never aliveAnd we won't be born againBut I will never surviveWith dead memories in my heartDead memories in my heartDead memories in my heartYou told me to love you and I didTied my soul into a knot and got me to submitSo when I got away, I only kept my scarsThe other me is gone. Now I don't know where I belongWe were never aliveAnd we won't be born againBut I'll never surviveWith dead memories in my heartDead memories in my heartDead memories in my heartDead memories in my heartDead visions in your nameDead fingers in my veinsDead memories in my heartDead memories in my heartDead memories in my heartDead memories in my heartOh, oh
