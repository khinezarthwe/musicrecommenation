Woke up and for the first time the animals were goneIt's left this house empty now, not sure if I belongYesterday you asked me to write you a pleasant songI'll do my best now, but you've been gone for so longThe window's open now and the winter settles inWe'll call it Christmas when the adverts beginI love your depression and I love your double chinI love 'most everything that you bring to this offeringOh I know that I left you in places of despairOh I know that I love you, so please throw down your hairAt night I trip without you, and hope I don't wake up'Cause waking up without you is like drinking from an empty cupWoke up and for the first time the animals were goneOur clocks are ticking now so before our time is goneWe could get a house and some boxes on the lawnWe could make babies and accidental songsI know I've been a liar and I know I've been a foolI hope we didn't break yet, but I'm glad we broke the rulesMy cave is deep now, yet your light is shining throughI cover my eyes, still all I see is youOh I know that I left you in places of despairOh I know that I love you, so please throw down your hairAt night I trip without you, and hope that I don't wake up'Cause waking up without you is like drinking from an empty cup
