C'monI read the book from back to frontIt made a deep impressionTwenty thousand pages babyI hoped for some directionI stood before the mirrorI stared at my reflectionI'd almost disappearedAnd I made no impressionI went down to my baby's houseAnd I sat down on the stepSaid 2000 years of Christian history babyAnd you ain't learned to love me yetMy baby looked me in the eyeMy nails were bitten to the quickShe said you used to love me all night longBut you've gotten so thin and sickI'm gonna send you a love bombI'm gonna send you a love bombI read that book from back to frontLooking for some inspirationI'd been listening to the radioTrying to find some self expressionI been listening to the woman's hourI been listening to Gardeners Question TimeBut every thing I try to growI can't even grow a dandelionI've been watching the MTVI've been watching the BBCAnd I've been searching on the InternetAnd I'm getting so thin and sickI'm gonna send you a love bombI'm gonna send you a love bombI went to my baby's houseAnd I sat down on the stepYeah I went down to my baby's houseAnd I lay down on the stepShe said what are you doing hereI said I been trying to make some senseBut every action that I takeIs of absolutely no fucking consequenceMy baby said you can sit thereShe reached down with her fingersHer fingers went right through me(I screamed my head off)I was so thin and sickI'm gonna send you a love bombI'm gonna send you a love bomb
