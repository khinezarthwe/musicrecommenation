When I saw you in the GardenSweet lilac in your hair,The sunlight seemed to surround youAnd bless the morning air.I wondered what your name wasAnd if you would dance with me,I heard you cry for mercyBut, my eyes they could not see.'Cos the time is right for love,The time is right for love,You can pray to the Lord aboveBut, the time is right for love.So much for all your sweet words,All that you said you would do.Remember all my love songs,They were promises to you.But, I don't hold it against you,I know you're not to blameSo draw your circle around meAnd we'll put all your lovers to shame.'Cos the time is right for love,The time is right for love,You can pray to the Lord aboveBut, the time is right for love.(Solo)'Cos the time is right for love,The time is right for love,You can pray to the Lord aboveBut, the time is right for love...
