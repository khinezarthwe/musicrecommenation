Hello, I love youWon't you tell me your name?Hello, I love youLet me jump in your gameHello, I love youWon't you tell me your name?Hello, I love youLet me jump in your gameShe's walkin' down the streetBlind to every eye she meetsDo you think you'll be the guyTo make the queen of the angels sigh?Hello, I love youWon't you tell me your name?Hello, I love youLet me jump in your gameHello, I love youWon't you tell me your name?Hello, I love youLet me jump in your gameShe holds her head so highLike a statue in the skyHer arms are wicked and her legs are longWhen she moves my brain screams out this songSidewalk crouches at her feetLike a dog that begs for something sweetDo you hope to make her see you, fool?Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?HelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloHelloI want youI need youLoveLoveHelloHelloHello
