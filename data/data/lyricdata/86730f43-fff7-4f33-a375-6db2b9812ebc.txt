Cut my tongue out, I've been caught out Like a giant juggernaut Happy hours, golden showers On a cruise to freak you out We could fly a helicopter Nothing left to talk about Entertain you, celebrate you I'll be back to frame you When I grow up I'll be stable When I grow up I'll turn the tables Trying hard to fit among you Floating out to wonderland Unprotected, God I'm pregnant Damn the consequences When I grow up I'll be stable When I grow up I'll turn the tables Blood and blisters on my fingers Chaos rules when we're apart Watch my temper I go mental I'll try to be gentle When I grow up I'll be stable When I grow up I'll turn the tables When I grow up When I grow up When I grow up I'll turn the tables Don't take offense Can I make amends? Rip it up to shreds and let it go Don't take offense Can I make amends? Rip it up to shreds and let it go Rip it up to shreds and let it go Rip it up to shreds and let it go Rip it up in shreds and let it go
