Cut my tongue out, I've been caught outLike a giant juggernautHappy hours, golden showersOn a cruise to freak you outWe could fly a helicopterNothing left to talk aboutEntertain you, celebrate youI'll be back to frame youWhen I grow up I'll be stableWhen I grow up I'll turn the tablesTrying hard to fit among youFloating out to wonderlandUnprotected, God I'm pregnantDamn the consequencesWhen I grow up I'll be stableWhen I grow up I'll turn the tablesBlood and blisters on my fingersChaos rules when we're apartWatch my temper I go mentalI'll try to be gentleWhen I grow up I'll be stableWhen I grow up I'll turn the tablesWhen I grow upWhen I grow upWhen I grow up I'll turn the tablesDon't take offenseCan I make amends?Rip it up to shreds and let it goDon't take offenseCan I make amends?Rip it up to shreds and let it goRip it up to shreds and let it goRip it up to shreds and let it goRip it up in shreds and let it go
