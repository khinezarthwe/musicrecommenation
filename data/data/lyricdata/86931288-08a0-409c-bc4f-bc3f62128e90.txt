Born from some mother's wombJust like any other roomMade a promise for a new lifeMade a victim out of your lifeWhen your time's on the doorAnd it drips to the floorAnd you feel you can touchAll the noise is too muchAnd the seeds that are sownAre no longer your ownJust a minor operationTo force a final ultimatumThousand words are spoken loudReach the dumb to fool the crowdWhen you walk down the streetAnd the sound's not so sweetAnd you wish you could hideMaybe go for a rideTo some peep show arcadeWhere the future's not madeA nightmare situationInfiltrate imaginationSmacks of past Holy warsBy the wall with broken lawsThe leaders of menBorn out of your frustrationThe leaders of menJust a strange infatuationThe leaders of menMade a promise for a new lifeNo saviour for our sakesTo twist the internees of hateSelf induced manipulationTo crush all thoughts of mass salvation
