(Put the little kids in the corner with their face and their eyes in the corner)My favorite band, is a witch.Find themselves in poet corners, and they still like to dick.It's of course, they're afraid. It's a fine, complicate.You can find, demonstrate. Slip along, demon ways.My favorite band, is a witch.Find themselves with perfect mornings, and they still try to live.The menstration. Pull it surprised a masterbation. A little morning criesI wish on thievery of corners. Admit the cries I know he's saying I know he's saying so tiredThey'll have to put the little kids in the corner with there eyes and face on the floor.You're so fucked up now. You're fucked up now.Put the little kids in the corner with their eyes and face on the floor.Put the little kids in the corner with their eyes and face on the floor.I know you want me to keep on goingYou want me to keep on going.And you know wherever I am..
