In the absence of your loveAnd in the absence of human touchI have decided I'm throwing my arms aroundAround Paris because only stone and steel accept my loveIn the absence of your smiling faceI traveled all over the placeand I have decided I'm throwing my arms aroundAround Paris because only stone and steel accept my loveI'm throwing my arms aroundAround Paris because only stone and steel accept my loveI'm throwing my arms around Paris becauseNobody wants my loveNobody wants my loveNobody needs my loveNobody wants my loveYes you made yourself plainYes you made yourself very plain
