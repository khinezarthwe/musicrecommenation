Suicide is in my blood It always was But it doesn't evaporate, in the light any more And this world is no place For a mind, or a thought No it's not Well that's been said before The space and the woods, still know who I am And I know, they don't owe me anything, not after what I've done Put on my radiation suit and slip away I'm on the run from what I've become And this life finds suicide Picks up a whole lot of different speeds And I know, they don't owe me anything Not after what I've done Late on a Monday night I'm on the grapevine Beating around the bush And to the baseline Thinking about the time When I was dancing, slow And out of control I'm shit hot so say what you think about me I'm not gonna cry 'cos I, I don't care I'm shit hot so say what you think about me I'm not gonna cry 'cos I, I've done nothing I've done nothing But they forgive anything Like, how, I, don't, stop, you Breaking my arms And chopping me, chopping me down So I fit in your laptop I've done nothing
