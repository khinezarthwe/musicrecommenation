Suicide is in my bloodIt always wasBut it doesn't evaporate, in the light any moreAnd this world is no placeFor a mind, or a thoughtNo it's notWell that's been said beforeThe space and the woods, still know who I amAnd I know, they don't owe me anything, not after what I've donePut on my radiation suit and slip awayI'm on the run from what I've becomeAnd this life finds suicidePicks up a whole lot of different speedsAnd I know, they don't owe me anythingNot after what I've doneLate on a Monday nightI'm on the grapevineBeating around the bushAnd to the baselineThinking about the timeWhen I was dancing, slowAnd out of controlI'm shit hot so say what you think about meI'm not gonna cry 'cos I, I don't careI'm shit hot so say what you think about meI'm not gonna cry 'cos I, I've done nothingI've done nothingBut they forgive anythingLike, how, I, don't, stop, youBreaking my armsAnd chopping me, chopping me downSo I fit in your laptopI've done nothing
