If I should die this very momentI wouldn't fearFor I've never known completenessLike being hereWrapped in the warmth of youLoving every breath of youStill my heart this momentOr it might burstCould we stay right hereUntil the end of time until the earth stops turningWanna love you until the seas run dryI've found the one I've waited forAll this time I've loved youAnd never known your faceAll this time I've missed youAnd searched this human raceHere is true peaceHere my heart knows calmSafe in your soulBathed in your sighsWanna stay right hereUntil the end of time'Til the earth stops turningGonna love you until the seas run dryI've found the one I've waited forThe one I've waited forAll I've knownAll I've doneAll I've felt was leading to thisAll I've knownAll I've doneAll I've felt was leading to thisWanna stay right here'Til the end of time 'till the earth stops turningI'm gonna love you till the seas run dryI've found the one I've waited forThe one I've waited forThe one I've waited forWanna stay right here'Til the end of time 'till the earth stops turningI'm gonna love you till the seas run dryI've found the one I've waited forThe one I've waited forThe one I've waited for
