I wonder why I don't know what you see Of course I care, I won't pretend It's just I thought I'd said enough Don't you know life turns me, always wants me? I can hardly pray I could try, but don't know what you hear' Cause in my heart, you were so clear It's just I thought I'd said enough Don't you know life turns me, always wants me? I can hardly pray On your stage, a show that you create All by yourself, I am nowhere You never noticed, you were so sure Don't you know life turns me, always wants me? I can hardly pray
