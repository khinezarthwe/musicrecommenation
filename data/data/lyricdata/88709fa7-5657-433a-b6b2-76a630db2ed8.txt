Ya-ee! Icky thump, who'da thunk? Sitting drunk on a wagon to Mexico Ah well, what a chump, well, my head got a bump When I hit it on the radio Redhead señorita looking dead came and said" Need a bed?" en Español I said "gimme a drink of water, I'm gonna 'sing around the collar' And I don't need a microphone" Icky thump with a lump in my throat grabbed my coat And I was freaking I was ready to go And I swear besides the hair she had one white eye, One blank stare looking up, lying there On the stand near her hand was a candy cane Black rum, sugar cane dry ice something strange La la-la la la-la, la la-la la la la la White Americans, what? Nothing better to do? Why don't you kick yourself out? You're an immigrant, too Who's using who? What should we do? Well, you can't be a pimp and a prostitute too Icky thump handcuffed to a bunk robbed blind Looked around and there was nobody else Left alone I hit myself with a stone Went home and learned how to clean up after myself
