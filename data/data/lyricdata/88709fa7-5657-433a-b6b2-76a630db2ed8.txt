Ya-ee!Icky thump, who'da thunk?Sitting drunk on a wagon to MexicoAh well, what a chump, well, my head got a bumpWhen I hit it on the radioRedhead señorita looking dead came and said"Need a bed?" en EspañolI said "gimme a drink of water, I'm gonna 'sing around the collar'And I don't need a microphone"Icky thump with a lump in my throat grabbed my coatAnd I was freaking I was ready to goAnd I swear besides the hair she had one white eye,One blank stare looking up, lying thereOn the stand near her hand was a candy caneBlack rum, sugar cane dry ice something strangeLa la-la la la-la, la la-la la la la laWhite Americans, what? Nothing better to do?Why don't you kick yourself out? You're an immigrant, tooWho's using who? What should we do?Well, you can't be a pimp and a prostitute tooIcky thump handcuffed to a bunk robbed blindLooked around and there was nobody elseLeft alone I hit myself with a stoneWent home and learned how to clean up after myself
