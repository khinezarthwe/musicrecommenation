She got them eagle feathers and cocaine eyes She got the heat to make a dead man rise A rose in her hair, a devil may care attitude She never said she would stay by my side She only wanted to be there for the ride A bottle of wine, a couple of lines and she was there for the night Tried to change her ways I said I'd keep her in a golden cage She said, " Oh no this ain't no place for me" Angel of mercy, angel of greed Never stop till she get what she need She dance like Salome and curses with a Matelot tongue I said baby won't you slow down for me You got to move if you want to be free Like the wind I'm just blowing anywhere I please Tried to change her ways I said I'd keep her in a golden cage She said, " Oh no, this ain't no place for me" Lady, you're no lady, you're my woman Got the love I need, you are my woman Never change her ways Never keep her in a golden cage' Cause she say, " Oh no, this ain't no place for me" Tried to change her ways I said I'd keep her in a golden cage She said: " Oh no, this ain't no place for me" Lady, you're no lady, you're my woman Got the love I need, you are my woman Never change her ways Never keep her in a golden cage' Cause she say, " Oh no, this ain't no place for me"' Cause she say, " Oh no, this ain't no place for me" You might as well set me free
