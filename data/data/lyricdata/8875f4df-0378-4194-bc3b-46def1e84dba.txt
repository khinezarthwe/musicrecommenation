She got them eagle feathers and cocaine eyesShe got the heat to make a dead man riseA rose in her hair, a devil may care attitudeShe never said she would stay by my sideShe only wanted to be there for the rideA bottle of wine, a couple of lines and she was there for the nightTried to change her waysI said I'd keep her in a golden cageShe said, "Oh no this ain't no place for me"Angel of mercy, angel of greedNever stop till she get what she needShe dance like Salome and curses with a Matelot tongueI said baby won't you slow down for meYou got to move if you want to be freeLike the wind I'm just blowing anywhere I pleaseTried to change her waysI said I'd keep her in a golden cageShe said, "Oh no, this ain't no place for me"Lady, you're no lady, you're my womanGot the love I need, you are my womanNever change her waysNever keep her in a golden cage'Cause she say, "Oh no, this ain't no place for me"Tried to change her waysI said I'd keep her in a golden cageShe said: "Oh no, this ain't no place for me"Lady, you're no lady, you're my womanGot the love I need, you are my womanNever change her waysNever keep her in a golden cage'Cause she say, "Oh no, this ain't no place for me"'Cause she say, "Oh no, this ain't no place for me"You might as well set me free
