No one knows what it's likeTo be the bad manTo be the sad manBehind blue eyesNo one knows what it's likeTo be hatedTo be fatedTo telling only liesBut my dreams, they aren't as emptyAs my conscience seems to beI have hours, only lonelyMy love is vengeanceThat's never freeNo one knows what it's likeTo feel these feelingsLike I doAnd I blame youNo one bites back as hardOn their angerNone of my pain and woeCan show throughBut my dreams, they aren't as emptyAs my conscience seems to beI have hours, only lonelyMy love is vengeanceThat's never freeWhen my fist clenches, crack it openBefore I use it and lose my coolWhen I smile, tell me some bad newsBefore I laugh and act like a foolAnd if I swallow anything evilPut your finger down my throatAnd if I shiver, please give me a blanketKeep me warm, let me wear your coatNo one knows what it's likeTo be the bad manTo be the sad manBehind blue eyes
