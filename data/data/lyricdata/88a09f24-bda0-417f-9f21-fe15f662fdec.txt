Haven't laughed this hard in a long timeBetter stop now before I start cryingGo off to sleep in the sunshineI don't wanna see the day when it's dyingShe's a sight to see, she's a-good to meBut I'm already somebody's babyShe's a pretty thing and she knows everythingBut I'm already somebody's babyYou don't deserve to be lonelyBut those drugs you got won't make you feel betterPretty soon you'll find it's the onlyLittle part of your life you're keeping togetherI'd be nice to you if I could make it throughBut you're already somebody's babyI could make you smile if you stayed a whileBut how long will you stay with me, baby?Because your candle burns too brightI almost forgot it was twilightEven if I think that you are rightWell, I'm tired of being down, I got no fightYou're wonderful, and it's beautifulBut I'm already somebody's babyAnd if I went with you I'd disappoint you tooI'm already somebody's babyAlready somebody's baby
