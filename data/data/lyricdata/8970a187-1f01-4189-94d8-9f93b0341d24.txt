You've had your last regretsReached your final depthsDeepest pitsStepped aside for the world to pass you byChose to leave the fearYou are stuck in a world of deadlocksThis time it's realThis time it's for realThis worldIts evil waysThe pain that I hideLet's make this happenLeft with the shameWill somebody out there give me the blame?SomeoneLeft with the shameWill somebody out there give me the blame?SomeoneShow meIt's too far to seeWhat God made of us (God made of us)Tell me it's a dreamWas it meant to be this way?Left with the shameGive me the blameLeft with the shameGive me the blameLeft with the shameWill somebody out there give me the blame?SomeoneLeft with the shameWill somebody out there give me the blame?SomeoneLeft with the shameLeft with the shame
