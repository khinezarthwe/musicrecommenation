Shadows on the sun Another night's begun It's always darkin Luna Park Wind across the moon Electric storms and soona flying sparkin Luna Park And when we're getting higherwe're happy Somebody's eating firewe're happy The big wheel in the skywill make you scream Come on, join a line The ghost train leaves on time It's always darkin Luna Park On the shooting rangethe plastic prizes never change So make your markon Luna Park And when we're getting higherwe're happy Somebody's eating firewe're happy The big wheel in the skywill make you scream Thunder. I wonder? A storm will come one dayto blow us all awaylike dust on the moon In Luna Parkit can't be darktoo soon A storm is coming soon Like dust on the moon Every night we goto the latest horror showand hear the screamsin Luna dreams Fortune-tellers museon palms that bode bad news The future's darkin Luna Park And when we're feeling scaredwe're happy With circuses and breadwe're happy The whirling fair machinesare all we need Thunder. I wonder? A storm will come one dayto blow us all awaylike dust on the moon In Luna Parkit can't be darktoo soon
