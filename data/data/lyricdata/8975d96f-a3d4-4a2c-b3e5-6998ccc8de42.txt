Shadows on the sunAnother night's begunIt's always darkin Luna ParkWind across the moonElectric storms and soona flying sparkin Luna ParkAnd when we're getting higherwe're happySomebody's eating firewe're happyThe big wheel in the skywill make you screamCome on, join a lineThe ghost train leaves on timeIt's always darkin Luna ParkOn the shooting rangethe plastic prizes never changeSo make your markon Luna ParkAnd when we're getting higherwe're happySomebody's eating firewe're happyThe big wheel in the skywill make you screamThunder. I wonder?A storm will come one dayto blow us all awaylike dust on the moonIn Luna Parkit can't be darktoo soonA storm is coming soonLike dust on the moonEvery night we goto the latest horror showand hear the screamsin Luna dreamsFortune-tellers museon palms that bode bad newsThe future's darkin Luna ParkAnd when we're feeling scaredwe're happyWith circuses and breadwe're happyThe whirling fair machinesare all we needThunder. I wonder?A storm will come one dayto blow us all awaylike dust on the moonIn Luna Parkit can't be darktoo soon
