There's nothing wrong with meThere's something wrong with youThere's something wrong with meI hope your stepson doesn't eat the fishWhen we're crying for our next fixThere's nothing wrong with meThere's something wrong with youThere's something wrong with meI hope your stepson doesn't eat the fishWhen we're crying for our next fixKillers never hurt feelingsKillers never hurt feelingsKillers never hurt feelingsGonorrhea, GorgonzolaGonorrhea, GorgonzolaSingle files of clean feedingsI can't see your soul, soul through your eyesThe crying walls of sliding architectureKidnapped by the likes of pure conjectureUpholstery loving men all dwelling in the wellsKidnapped by the likes of pure conjectureKillers never hurt feelingsKillers never hurt feelingsKillers never hurt feelingsGonorrhea, GorgonzolaGonorrhea, GorgonzolaSingle files of clean feedingsThere's nothing wrong with meThere's something wrong with youWrong with you and IWhen we're crying for our next fixThere's nothing wrong with meThere's something wrong with youWrong with you and IWhen we're crying for our next fixKillers never hurt feelingsKillers never hurt feelingsKillers never hurt feelingsGonorrhea, GorgonzolaGonorrhea, GorgonzolaSingle files of clean feedingsSingle files of clean feedingsThere's nothing wrong with meThere's something wrong with youThere's something wrong with meI hope your stepson doesn't eat the fishThere's nothing wrong with meThere's something wrong with youThere's nothing wrong with meThere's something wrong with youThere's something wrong with meI hope your stepson doesn't eat the fishThere's nothing wrong with meThere's something wrong with youDon't eat the fishSONG MEANING: This song is basically about America's rising obsession with drugs.
