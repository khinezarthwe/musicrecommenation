You're keeping in step and in lineGot your chin held high and you feel just fine'Cause you do what you're toldBut inside your heart it is black, it is hollow and it's coldJust how deep do you believe?Will you bite the hand that feeds?Will you chew until it bleeds?Can you get up off your knees?Are you brave enough to see?Do you wanna change it?What if this whole crusade's a charadeAnd behind it all there's a price to be paidFor the blood which we dineJustified in the name of the holy and the divineJust how deep do you believe?Will you bite the hand that feeds?Will you chew until it bleeds?Can you get up off your knees?Are you brave enough to see?Do you wanna change it?So naiveI keep holding on to what I wanna believeI can seeBut I keep holding on and on and on and onWill you bite the hand that feeds you?Will you stay down on your knees?Will you bite the hand that feeds you?Will you stay down on your knees?Will you bite the hand that feeds you?Will you stay down on your knees?Will you bite the hand that feeds you?Will you stay down on your knees?Will you bite the hand that feeds you?Will you stay down on your knees?Will you bite the hand that feeds you?Will you stay down on your knees?Will you bite the hand that feeds you?Will you stay down on your knees?Will you bite the hand that feeds you?Will you stay down on your knees?
