My beloved monster and meWe go everywhere togetherWearing a raincoat that has four sleevesGets us through all kinds of weatherShe will always be the only thingThat comes between me and the awful stingThat comes from livin' in a world that's so damn meanMy beloved monster is toughIf she wants she will destroy youBut if you lay her down for a kissHer little heart it could explodeShe will always be the only thingThat comes between me and the awful stingThat comes from livin' in a world that's so damn meanLa la la la la la la laLa la la la la la
