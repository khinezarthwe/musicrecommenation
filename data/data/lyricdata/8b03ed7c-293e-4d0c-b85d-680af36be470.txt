Getting crazy on the waltzers but it's the life that I chooseYeah sing about the sixblade sing about the switchback and a torture tattooAnd I been riding on a ghost train where the cars they scream and slamAnd I don't know where I'll be tonight but I'd always tell you where I amIn a screaming ring of faces I seen her standing in the lightShe had a ticket for the races yeah just like me she was a victim of the nightI put my hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it rollI had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soulAnd the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up aboveAnd I'm just high on the worldCome on and take a low ride with me girlOn the tunnel of love yeah-eah loveIt's just the danger when you're riding at your own riskShe said you are the perfect stranger she said baby let's keep it like thisIt's just a cake walk twisting baby yeah step right up and seeHey mister give me two give me two now cos any two can playAnd the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up aboveAnd I'm just high on the worldCome on and take a low ride with me girlOn the tunnel of love whoa-oah loveWell it's been money for muscle on a another whirligigMoney for muscle and a another girl I digAnother hustle just to just to make it bigAnd Rockaway RockawayOh Rockaway RockawayAnd girl it looks so pretty to me like it always didOh like The Spanish City to me when-a we were kidsYeah girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always didOh like The Spanish City to me when-a we were kidsCheck it outShe took off a silver locket she said remember me by thisShe put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kissAnd in the roar of dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk awayI could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me stayAnd the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up aboveAnd I'm just high on this worldCome on and take a low ride with me girlOn the tunnel of love yeah-eah love love loveOn the tunnel of love whoa-oah love loveAnd now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcadesSearching everywhere from steeplechase to palisadesIn any shooting gallery where promises are madeTo Rockaway RockawayRockaway Rockaway from Cullercoats and Whitley Bay out to RockawayAnd girl it looks so pretty to me like it always didLike The Spanish City to me when we were kidsGirl it looks so pretty to me like it always didLike The Spanish City to me when-a we were kids
