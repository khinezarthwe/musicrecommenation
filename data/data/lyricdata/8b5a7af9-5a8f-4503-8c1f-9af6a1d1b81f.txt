Listen nowI am afraid of everythingWhen you told me I was specialIt was the happiest moment for a long long timeListen nowI keep forgetting your nameWhen you laid down on the kitchen floorIt was the happiest moment for a long long timeWe seek new seed nowSome revolutionaryand you will never get a holdWe seek and we will findreason to stay aliveThe price has never been this lowListen nowI was afraid of everythingThen I straightened my head upIt was the happiest moment for a long long timeWe seek new seed nowSome revolutionaryand you will never get a holdWe seek and we will findreason to stay aliveThe price has never been this low
