No one's picking up the phoneGuess it's me and meAnd this little masochistShe's ready to confessAll the things that I never thoughtThat she could feel andHey JupiterNothing's been the sameSo are you gay? Are you blue?Thought we both could use a friend to run toAnd I thought I wouldn't have to beWith you as something newSometimes I breathe you inAnd I know you knowAnd sometimes you take a swimFound your writing on my wallIf my heart's soaking wetBoy, your boots can leave a messHey JupiterNothing's been the sameSo are you gay? Are you blue?Thought we both could use a friend to run toAnd I thought you wouldn't have to keepWith me hidingThought I knew myself so wellAll the dolls I hadTook my leather off the shelfYour apocalypse was fabFor a girl who couldn't choose betweenThe shower or the bathAnd I thought I wouldn't have to beWith you a magazineNo one's picking up the phoneGuess it's clear he's goneAnd this little masochistIs lifting up her dressGuess I thought I could never feelThe things I feel andHey JupiterNothing's been the sameSo are you gay? Are you blue?Thought we both could use a friend to run toHey JupiterNothing's been the sameSo are you safe now we're through?Thought we both could use a friend to run toHey Jupiter
