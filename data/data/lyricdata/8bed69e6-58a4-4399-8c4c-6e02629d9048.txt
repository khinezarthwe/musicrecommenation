Born to push you aroundBetter just stay downYou pull away, he hits the flesh, you hit the groundMouths so full of liesTend to block your eyesJust keep them closed, keep prayin', just keep waitin'Waiting for the oneThe day that never comesWhen you stand up and feel the warmthBut the sunshine never comes, noNo, the sunshine never comesPush you 'cross that lineJust stay down this timeHide in yourself, crawl in yourself, you'll have your timeGod, I'll make them payTake it back one dayI'll end this day, I'll splatter color on this grayWaiting for the oneThe day that never comesWhen you stand up and feel the warmthBut the sunshine never comesLove is a four letter wordAnd never spoken hereLove is a four letter wordHere in this prisonI suffer this no longerI'll put an end to this, I swearThis, I swear: The sun will shineThis I swearThis I swearThis I swear
