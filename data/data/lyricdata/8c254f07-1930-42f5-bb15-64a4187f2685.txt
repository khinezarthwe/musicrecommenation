In this hole that we have fixedWe get further and further and furtherFrom the worldWe must doI saw you asleep beside a wallYour skull inside a ballYour eyes blackened byThe sound and the thought of GodWhere should I hang my head?Where would you like for me to hang my head?One absence of truthAnd one horrible thing I sawWhat you truly wanted to becomeAnd who you thought I wasThe fall, the fallAfraid to loveWhat is deeper than the graveGoes all the way down those tracksEverybody bow your head for the greatest inspirationComplete contradictionAwayIn this hole that we have fixedWe get further and furtherFrom the worldWe must doI know this, I know thisYou know this, you know thisIn this hole that we have fixedWe get further and further and furtherFrom the worldWe must doI saw you outside that wallYour skull outside that wallYour eyes perceived by the soundAnd the light of God
