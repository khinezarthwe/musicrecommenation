You can write my place out of the life you makeAnd all the things that mattered when you knew my faceCross off all the ways I failed you 'cause I failed youBut I'm still in your bloodYou're still in my bloodA time when all our mistakes made sense, you needed itA time when all the lying sympathized with sinAll this sabotage and blame, well, I can take it'Cause I just want you backI just want you backTemporary battles can take up half your lifeHow you dig your bed, will it help you sleep at night?Forgiveness like a blanket that you want to forgetBut you still crumble at my nameYou still crumble at my nameA time when all our mistakes made sense, you needed itA time when all the lying sympathized with sinAll this sabotage and blame, well, I can take it'Cause I just want you backI just want you back
