You can write my place out of the life you make And all the things that mattered when you knew my face Cross off all the ways I failed you 'cause I failed you But I'm still in your blood You're still in my blood A time when all our mistakes made sense, you needed it A time when all the lying sympathized with sin All this sabotage and blame, well, I can take it' Cause I just want you back I just want you back Temporary battles can take up half your life How you dig your bed, will it help you sleep at night? Forgiveness like a blanket that you want to forget But you still crumble at my name You still crumble at my name A time when all our mistakes made sense, you needed it A time when all the lying sympathized with sin All this sabotage and blame, well, I can take it' Cause I just want you back I just want you back
