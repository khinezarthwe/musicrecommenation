Stitch in your knitted browAnd you don't know howYou're gonna get it outCrushed under heavy chestTrying to catch your breathBut it always beats you by a step,All right nowMaking the best of itPlaying the hand you getYou're not alone in thisThere's hope for the hopelessHope for the hopelessThere's hopeCold in a summer breezeYeah, you're shiveringOn your bended kneeStill, when your heart is soreAnd the heavens pourLike a willow bending with the stormYou'll make itRunning against the windPlaying the cards you getSomething is bound to giveThere's hope for the hopelessHope for the hopelessThere's hopeThere's hope for the hopelessHope for the hopelessThere's hope
