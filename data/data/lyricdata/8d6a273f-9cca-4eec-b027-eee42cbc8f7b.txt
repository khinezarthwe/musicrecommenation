Waiting for the moon to rise againAcross the darkened skyStars they will shine againThey're shining above youSatellite dreams come raining downKeep falling to the earthRun as they hit the groundAnd shatter around youAny given minute we'll witnessThe planets falling from an highSparkle as they're fallingThrough the twilight sky[Chorus]Fly overDystopiaAll overNo one understand how we possiblyCould circle 'round the worldAverting catastropheAverting the sunriseRunning out of senses to guide the wayWe're running out of timeRunning from yesterdayWe're running through darknessAny given minute we'll witnessThe planet falling from an highSparkle as they're fallingThrough the twilight sky[Chorus]Fly overDystopiaAll over
