Sunspots cast a glare in my eyesSometimes I forget I'm aliveI feel it coming and I've gotta get out of it's wayI hear it calling and I come cause I can't disobeyI should not listen and I shouldn't believe but I doYes I doShe turns me onShe makes it realI have to apologizeFor the way I feelMy life it seems has taken a turnWhy in the name of God would I ever want to returnPeel off our skin we're gonna burn what we were to the groundFuck in the fire and we'll spread all the ashes aroundI wanna kill away the rest of what's left and I doYes I doShe turns me onShe makes it realI have to apologizeFor the way I feelAnd nothing can stop me nowThere is nothing to fearAnd everything I'd ever wantIs inside of hereWoah woah woah woahInside us hereNow I just stare into the sunAnd I see everything I've doneI think I could have been someoneBut I can't stop what has begunWhen everything is said and doneAnd there is no place left to runI think I used to be someoneNow I just stare into the sun
