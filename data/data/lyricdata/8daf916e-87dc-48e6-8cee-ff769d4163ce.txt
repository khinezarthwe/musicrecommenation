Well you got it so goodYou live for the actionUsed to be a husbandNow you got yourself some satisfactionA dog in a bag and a boneBut you're lost in the rain 21 million miles from homeYou got brand new shoesA healthy fixationAtomic heartAnd a two for one educationYou're breaking my heart all the wayWith your dog in a bag I need your badness just to get through the dayIt's a million o'clock, too hot to sleepA rotten taste in my mouth and my eyes are deepThere's nothing much really going on up hereI'm holding on for dear life and one more beerI guess you could say it's a sick little showA bottle of troubles and a bed full of woeIt's easy to see without looking too farYou'd have to be a saint to be as sick as you areHalf the world's asleepThe rest of them are dreamingGod forbid if you forget to close the door as you're leavingI hate to see you in a bindWith your dog in a bagSleeping next to your ridiculous mindWith a dog in a bagSleeping next to your ridiculous mindWith a dog in a bagSleeping next to your ridiculous mind
