One, two, three, four!Well, every highway that I go down seems to be longerThan the last one that I knew about, oh, well.And every girl that I walk around seems to be more of an illusionThan the last one that I found, oh, well.And this old man in front of me wearing canes and ruby ringsIs like containing an explosion when he sings,And with every chance to set himself on fire,He just ends up doin' the same thing.Well, each beautiful thing I come across tells meTo stop moving and shake this riddle off, oh, well.And there was a time when all I wanted was my ice cream colderAnd a little cream soda, oh, well, oh, well.And a wooden box and an alley full of rocks was all I had to care about,Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well.Now my mind is filled with rubber tires and forest firesAnd whether I'm a liar,And lots of other situations where I don't know what to doAt which time God screams to me, "There's nothing left for me to tell you."Nothing left for me to tell you.Nothing left.Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well, oh, well.Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well, oh, well.
