I'm a fountain of bloodIn the shape of a girlYou're the bird on the brimHypnotized by the whirlDrink me, make me feel realWet your beak in the streamGame we're playing is lifeLove's a two way dreamLeave me now, return tonightTide will show you the wayIf you forget my name you will go astrayLike a killer whale trapped in a bayI'm a path of cindersBurning under your feetYou're the one who walks meI'm your one-way street???????????????????I'm a whisper in waterSecret for you to hearYou're the one who grows distantWhen I beckon you nearLeave me now, return tonightThe tide will show you some wayIf you forget my name, you will go astrayLike a killer whale trapped in a bayI'm a tree that grows heartsOne for each that you takeYou're the intruder's handI'm the branch that you break
