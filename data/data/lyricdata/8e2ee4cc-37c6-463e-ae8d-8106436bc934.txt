I was dreaming of the past,Why do good times never lastHelp me Jesus, show the wayI can't hold on another dayI was hungry, felling low,I just couldn't make out which way to goChasing rainbows that have no end,The road is long without friendBe my friend, be my brother,Be the piper, play the callAcross the seven seas of wonderBe the guardian of my soulJust a young man looking homeward,Watching the sun go down againAcross the water, the sun is shining,But, will it ever, will it ever be the sameBe my friend, be my brother,Be the piper, play the callAcross the seven seas of wonderBe the guardian of my soulI need somebody, I need someone,I need somebody to call my ownLike a blindman, I can feel the heat of the sun,But, like a blindmanI don't know, I don't know,I don't know where it's coming fromBe my friend, be my brother,Be the piper, play the callAcross the seven seas of wonderBe the guardian of my soulI need somebody, I need someone,I need somebody to call my ownLike a blindman, I can feel the heat of the sun,But, like a blindmanI don't know, I don't know,I don't know where is coming from
