Must have been loveBut it's over nowLay a whisper on my pillowLeave the winter on the groundI wake up lonely, this air of silenceIn the bedroom and all aroundTouch me now, I close my eyesAnd dream awayIt must have been love, but it's over nowIt must have been good, but I lost it somehowIt must have been love, but it's over nowFrom the moment we touched till the time had run outMake-believing we're togetherThat I'm sheltered by your heartBut in and outside I turn to waterLike a teardrop in your palmAnd it's a hard winter's dayI dream awayIt must have been lovebut it's over nowIt was all that I wanted, now I'm living withoutIt must have been lovebut it's over nowIt's where the water flowsIt's where the wind blowsIt must have been lovebut it's over nowIt must have been good, but I lost it somehowIt must have been lovebut it's over nowFrom the moment we touched till the time had run outYeah, it must have been lovebut it's over nowIt was all that I wanted, now I'm living withoutIt must have been love, but it's over nowIt's where the water flowsIt's where the wind blowsIt must have been loveBut it's over nowNo, no, no
