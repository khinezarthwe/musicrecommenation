Down below a faded glowVibrant key without a toneRealise in here it's coldI can only let it snowWords were said so long agoLeft a mark, an open soreYou go fast, I'm burnin' slowHate to say I knew you'd goSo much going onAnd I wish to hold onSo much going onAnd I cannot let goPast the trees that hide our loveHurry now it's time to goMake this moment matter moreShow me like you did beforeRevolting in a broken homeHolding on to what we ownWorlds collide and cause a stormStill I wish I could hold onWords were said so long agoFace defeat and take the blowSo na√Øve now I know moreWon't forget the things beforeSo much going onAnd I wish to hold onSo much going onAnd I cannot let go...cannot let go...
