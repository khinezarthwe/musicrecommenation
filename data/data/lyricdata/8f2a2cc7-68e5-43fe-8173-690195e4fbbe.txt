When the world has turnedParalyzed and wrongCold blooded claws never offered anything at allPast the point of loveShattered and untiedWaiting to pick up the pieces that make it all alrightBut pieces of what?Pieces of what?Pieces of what doesn't matter anymoreMoonlight on my floorShining through the roofThey got the city surrounded as if I needed proofI forgot my fearFeelings on the riseBuried by all of the pieces falling from the skyBut pieces of what?Pieces of what?Pieces of what we used to call homePieces of what we used to call homeLay my dragon's teethAnd shallow water steelAt the Belgian gates, I waited for my meal
