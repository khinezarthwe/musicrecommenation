Sharpen my body like a penCome on I need to show itSomething too small for a lenseIf I rub it, if I wipe itGuiding with one single handNothing's wrong, you like the feelingI am all over the landCome on, I need to show itBack on the mountain againI was standing watching seasonsYou're now my only friendI'm too heavy, I'm the burdenSitting and picking on myselfIt's a shiny, shiny morningAnd when the light finds my eyeI'll be fleeting like a scentI hold my breath and then count to threeOn and on, outwornMust be five hundred degreesCan't sail on, outwornI hold my breath and then count to threeOn and on, outwornMust be five hundred degreesWill it show, in my show
