You are my sweetest downfallI loved you first, I loved you firstBeneath the sheets of paper lies my truthI have to go, I have to goYour hair was long when we first metSamson went back to bedNot much hair left on his headHe ate a slice of wonderbreadAnd went right back to bedAnd the history books forgot about usAnd the Bible didn't mention usAnd the Bible didn't mention usNot even onceYou are my sweetest downfallI loved you first, I loved you firstBeneath the stars came fallin' on our headsBut they're just old light, they're just old lightYour hair was long when we first metSamson came to my bedTold me that my hair was redHe told me I was beautifulAnd came into my bedOh, I cut his hair myself one nightA pair of dull scissors in the yellow lightAnd he told me that I'd done alrightAnd kissed me till the morning light, the morning lightAnd he kissed me till the morning lightSamson went back to bedNot much hair left on his headHe ate a slice of wonderbreadAnd went right back to bedOh, we couldn't bring the columns downYeah, we couldn't destroy a single oneAnd history books forgot about usAnd the Bible didn't mention usNot even onceYou are my sweetest downfallI loved you first
