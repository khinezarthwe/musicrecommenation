Silver birch against a Swedish skyThe singer in the band made me want to cryWe're all inside our own heads nowWe are leaving new friends, leaving this townAnd I wish you could be here with meI would show you off like a trophyThe road it winds, it twists, it turns, oh my stomach burnsOnce again I'll be the foolish oneThinking a blink of these lashes would make you comeDon't you worry, don't get in a stateI don't believe in true love anywayOh, who's being pessimistic now?I could document this as our first, as our last rowThe more you look forlorn, the more to you I warmI won't be seeing you for a long whileI hope it's not as long as these country milesI feel lostI feel lostNo, I won't be seeing you for a long whileI hope it's not as long as these country milesI feel lostI feel lost
