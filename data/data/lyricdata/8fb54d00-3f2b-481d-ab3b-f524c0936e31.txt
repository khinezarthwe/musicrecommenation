I love the feeling when we lift offWatching the world so small belowI love the dreaming when I think ofThe safety in the clouds out my windowI wonder what keeps us so high upCould there be love beneath these wings?If we suddenly fall, should I scream out?Or keep very quiet and cling toMy mouth as I'm cryingSo frightened of dying"Relax", yes, I'm tryingBut fear's got a hold on meYes, this fear's got a hold on meYes, this fear's got a hold on meI love the quiet of the nighttimeWhen the sun is drowned in a deathly seaI can feel my heart beating as I speed fromThe sense of time catching up with meThe sky set out like a pathwayBut who decides which route we take?As people drift into a dream worldI close my eyes as my hands shakeAnd will I see a new day?Who's driving this anyway?I picture my own graveCos fear's got a hold on meYes, this fear's got a hold on meYes, this fear's got a hold on meYes, this fear's got a hold on meYes, this fear's got a hold on meFloating neither up or downI wonder when I'll hit the groundWill the earth beneath my body shakeAnd cast your sleeping hearts awake?Could it tremble stars from moonlit skies?Could it drag a tear from your cold eyes?I live on the right side and sleep on the leftThat's why everything's got to be love or deathYes, this fear's got a hold on meYes, this fear's got a hold on meYes, this fear's got a hold on meYes, this fear's got a hold on meYes, this fear's got a hold on meYes, this fear's got a hold on meYes, this fear's got a hold on meYes, this fear's got a hold on me
