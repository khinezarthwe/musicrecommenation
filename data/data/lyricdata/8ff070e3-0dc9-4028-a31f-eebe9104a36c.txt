Father I killed my monkeyI let it out to taste the sweet of springWonder if I will wander outTest my tether to see if I'm still free from youSteady as it comes right down to youI've said it allSo maybe we're a bliss of another kind I saidA bliss of another kind I saidLately I'm in to circuitryWhat it means to beMade of you but not enough of youAnd I wonder if you can bilocateIs that what I tasteYour supernova juice?You know it's trueI'm a part of youSteady as it comes right down to youI've said it allSo maybe we're a bliss of another kind I saidSteady as it comes right down to youI've said it allSo maybe you're a four horse engine with a power drive, I saidA hot kachina who wants into mine, I saidTake it, take it with your terra- terracideAnd I said steady as it comes right down to youI've said it allSo maybe we're a bliss of another kind I saidA bliss of another kind I saidA bliss of another kind I saidA bliss ofA bliss ofA bliss ofA bliss of another kind
