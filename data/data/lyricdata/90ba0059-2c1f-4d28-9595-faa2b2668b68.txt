Getting a little erratic hereAnd I don't know who to trustI guess they got a way of reading my mindI guess I gotta adjustGot my arms they flip flop flip flop flipGot my head on a springWell I thought I got you on my sideI haven't got fucking anythingI'm just a face in the crowdNothing to worry aboutNot even tryin' to stand outI'm getting smaller and smaller and smallerAnd I have nothing to sayIt's all been taken awayI just behave and obeyI'm afraid I am starting to fade awayUh-huhI cannot see through the cracksWhen I'm pressed up on the wallI'm not looking to stand up real highI'd be happy to crawlI think I'm losing my gripBut I can still make a fistYou know I still got my one good armThat I can beat, I can beat myself up withI'm just a face in the crowdNothing to worry aboutNot even tryin' to stand outI'm getting smaller and smaller and smallerAnd I have nothing to sayIt's all been taken awayI just behave and obeyI'm afraid I am starting to fade awayAnd for what it is worthI really used to believeThat maybe there's some great thingThat we could achieveAnd now I can't tell the differenceDon't know what to feelBetween what I've been trying so hard to seeAnd what appears to be realFading awayFading awayFading awayFading awayMy world is getting smaller everyday-yay-yay-yay-yayMy world is getting smaller everyday-yay-yay-yay-yayMy world is getting smaller everyday-yay-yay-yay-yayMy world is getting smaller everyday-yay-yay-yay-yayAnd thats okay
