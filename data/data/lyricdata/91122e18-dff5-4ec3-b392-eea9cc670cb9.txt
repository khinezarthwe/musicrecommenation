Your neighbors were screaming, I don't have a key for downstairsSo I punched all the buzzers, hoping you wouldn't be thereAnd now my head's hurting, you say I always get my own wayBut you were in the shower when I got there, and I'd have wanted to stayBut I got nothing to sayYou were so beautiful before todayAnd then I heard what you say, man, that was uglyThe Moschino bra you bought me last ChristmasPut it in the box, put it in the boxFrank's in there, and I don't carePut it in the box, put it in the boxJust take it, take the box, take the boxI came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should beI feel like writing you a letter but that's not me, you know meFeel so fucking angry, don't wanna be reminded of youBut when I left my shit in your kitchen,I said goodbye to your bedroomAnd smelled of youMr. False Pretense, you don't make sense, I just don't know youBut you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye? I think I love youThe Moschino bra you bought me last ChristmasPut it in the box, put it in the boxFrank's in there I don't carePut it in the box, put it in the boxNow take it, take the boxJust take it, take it take the boxAnd now just take the box, take the box
