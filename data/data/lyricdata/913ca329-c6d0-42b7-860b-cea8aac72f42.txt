It's a good thing tears never show in the pouring rainAs if a good thing ever could make up for all the painThere'll be no last chance, I promise to never mess it up againJust a sweet pain of watching your back as you walkAs I'm watching you walk awayAnd now you're gone, there's like an echo in my headAnd I remember every word you saidIt's a cool thing you'll never know all the ways I triedIt's a hard thing faking a smile when I feel like I'm falling apart insideAnd now you're gone, there's like an echo in my headAnd I remember every word you saidAnd you never were and you never will be mineNo, you never were and you never will be mineFor the first time, there is no mercy in your eyesAnd the cold wind's hitting my face and you're goneAnd you're walking awayAnd I am helpless sometimes, wishing's just no good'Cause you don't see me like I wish you would'Cause you never were and you never will be mineNo, you never were and you never will be mineThere's a moment to seize every time that we meetBut you always keep passing me byNo, you never were and you never will be mineI saw you at the stationYou had your arm around what's-her-nameShe had on that scarf I gave youYou got down to tie her laces'Cause you never were and you never will be mine(You looked happy and that's great)No, you never were and you never will be mine(I just miss you, that's all)'Cause you never were and you never will be mineNo, you never were and you never will be mineThere's a moment to seize every time that we meetBut you have always keep passing me byNo, you never were and you never will be mine'Cause you never were and you never will be mineNo, you never were and you never will be mineThere's a moment to seize every time that we meetBut you have always keep passing me byNo, you never were and you never will be mine
