I would say I'm sorryIf I thought that it would change your mindBut I know that this timeI have said too much, been too unkindI try to laugh about itCover it all up with liesI try to laugh about itHiding the tears in my eyes'Cause boys don't cryBoys don't cryI would break down at your feetAnd beg forgiveness, plead with youBut I know that it's too lateAnd now there's nothing I can doSo I try to laugh about itCover it all up with liesI try to laugh about itHiding the tears in my eyes'Cause boys don't cryBoys don't cryI would tell you that I loved youIf I thought that you would stayBut I know that it's no useThat you've already gone awayMisjudged your limitsPushed you too farTook you for grantedI thought that you needed me more, more, moreNow I would do most anythingTo get you back by my sideBut I just keep on laughingHiding the tears in my eyes'Cause boys don't cryBoys don't cryBoys don't cry
