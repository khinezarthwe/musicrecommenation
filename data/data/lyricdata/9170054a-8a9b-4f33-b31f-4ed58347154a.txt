Please could you stay awhile to share my grief,For it's such a lovely day,To have to always feel this way,And the time that I will suffer less,Is when I never have to wake.Wandering stars,For whom it is reserved,The blackness of darkness, forever,Wandering stars,For whom it is reserved,The blackness of darkness, forever.Those who have seen the needles I now tread,Like a husk, from which all that was now has fled,And the masks, that the monsters wear,To feed, upon their prey.Wandering stars,For whom it is reserved,The blackness of darkness, forever,Wandering stars,For whom it is reserved,The blackness of darkness, forever.Doubled up inside,Take awhile to share my grief,Always doubled up inside,Taunted, cruel.Wandering stars,For whom it is reserved,The blackness the darkness, forever.Wandering stars,For whom it is reserved,The blackness, the darkness, forever.
