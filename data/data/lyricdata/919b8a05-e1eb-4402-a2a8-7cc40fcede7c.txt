There is a house built out of stoneWooden floors, walls and window sillsTables and chairs worn by all of the dustThis is a place where I don't feel aloneThis is a place where I feel at homeAnd I built a homeFor youFor meUntil it disappearedFrom meFrom youAnd now, it's timeTo leave and turn to dustOut in the garden where we planted the seedsThere is a tree as old as meBranches were sewn by the color of greenGround had arose and passed its kneesBy the cracks of the skin I climbed to the topI climbed the tree to see the worldWhen the gusts came around to blow me downHeld on as tightly as you held onto meHeld on as tightly as you held onto meAnd I built a homeFor youFor meUntil it disappearedFrom meFrom youAnd now, it's timeTo leave and turn to dust
