The blank pages of my diaryThat I haven't touched since you left meThe closed blinds in my homeSee no light of dayDust gathers on my stereo'Cause I can't bear to hear the radioThe piano sits in a shaded spaceWith a picture of your faceI'm scared to face another day'Cause the fear in me just won't go awayIn an instantYou were gone, and I'm scaredCoffee stains on your favorite bookRemind me of you so I can't take a lookThe magazines you left on the floorYou won't need them anymoreA towel left hanging on the wallNo sign of wet footsteps in the hallThere's no smell of your sweet cologneI'm lying here aloneI'm scared to face another day'Cause the fear in me just won't go awayIn an instantYou were gone, and now I'm scaredI'm scared to face another day'Cause the fear in me just won't go awayIn an instantYou were gone, now I'm scaredIn an instantYou were gone, I'm scared
