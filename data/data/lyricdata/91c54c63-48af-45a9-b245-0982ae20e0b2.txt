In the days of my youth, I was told what it means to be a manNow I've reached that age, I've tried to do all those thingsThe best I can, no matter how I tryI find my way into the same old jamGood times, bad times, you know I had my shareWhen my woman left home for a brown eyed manWell, I still don't seem to careSixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could beOnly took a couple of days 'til she was rid of meShe swore that she would be all mine and love me till the endBut when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friendGood times, bad times, you know I had my shareWhen my woman left home for a brown eyed manWell, I still don't seem to careI know what it means to be alone, I sure do wish I was at homeI don't care what the neighbors say, I'm gonna love you eachAnd every day, you can feel the beat within my heartRealize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part
