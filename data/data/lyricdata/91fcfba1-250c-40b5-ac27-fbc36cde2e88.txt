I'm serving time, all for a crime I did commitYou want the truth? You know I'd do it all againLeft for dead, Heaven is only in my headI heard a voice calling from down inside a well"See that silver shine?" She said to come claim what was mineSo down I fell down into the water blackMy prison cell only the moon was shining backIf I seem lost, wellI weighed the costAnd chose my crimeNow it's mine, all mineI heard the voice calling from just outside the wellShe said, "You fool, now that you know your end is nearYou always fall for what you desire or what you fear"Resurrected, living in a lighthouseIf you leave, them ships are gonna wreckResurrected, living in a lighthouseThe lions and the lambs ain't sleeping yetResurrected, living in a lighthouseCan you see the funny side? The ships are gonna wreckResurrected, living in a lighthouseThe lions and the lambs ain't sleeping yetThe lions and the lambs ain't sleeping yetThe lions and the lambs ain't sleeping yet
