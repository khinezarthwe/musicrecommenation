When I look up from my pillowI dream you are there with meThough you are far awayI know you'll always be near to meYeah I go to sleepAnd imagine that you're there with meI go to sleepAnd imagine that you're there with meI look around meAnd feel you are ever so close to meEach tear that flows from my eyeBrings back memories of you to meI go to sleepAnd imagine that you're there with meI go to sleepAnd imagine that you're there with meI was wrong, I will cryI will love you till the day I dieYou alone, you alone and no one elseYou were meant for meWhen morning comes againI have the loneliness you left meEach day drags byUntil finally my time descends on meI go to sleepAnd imagine that you're there with meI go to sleepAnd imagine that you're there with me
