I'd like to laugh at what you said, but I just can't find a smileI wonder why I can't, I struggle with myselfHoping I might change a littleHoping that I might be someone I wanna beLooking out I want to know someone might careLooking out I want a reason to be there'Cause I don't know what I've done to deserve youand I don't know what I'll do without youLooking out I want to know some way might clearLooking out I want a reason to repair'Cause I don't know what I've done to deserve youAnd I don't know what I'll do without youI can't see nothing good, nothing is so badI never had the chance to explain exactly what I meant
