Sort of wonder whyNo one said a wordDon't you like it on the sly?Don't you like it till it hurts?Have I been on your mind?What's a voice without a song?Something in your headYou've been fighting all along...I don't want to say itThe news is not so goodWe'll never get awayAnd even if we couldWe'd just play the tambourineAround an open flameOversleep and burnTo be back in the game'Cause summer never comesNowhere near high noonAnd winter never comesNor the harvest moonRaw sugarDon't want to die living in a high rise graveI'll pray to call homeSave that dateHigh rise graveNo I'm not complainingYes it could be worseFerment on the wish boneMatch the lips to the purseNeighborhood's a runwayFry the ass and thighsDirty denim dealersPushed behind the eyes'Cause summer never comesNowhere near high noonAnd winter never comesNor the harvest moonRaw sugarDon't want to die living in a high rise graveI'll pray to call homeSave that dateHigh rise graveStill I wear the red dressPaint my toes and twirlTake it back to old timesWhen I was still a girl'Cause now I'm all baboon boysCoochie coochie cooSort of wonder whyI missed a kiss for you'Cause summer never comes (save that date)Winter never comes (high rise rate)
