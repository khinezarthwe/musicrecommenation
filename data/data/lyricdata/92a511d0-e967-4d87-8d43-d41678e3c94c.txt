Sort of wonder why No one said a word Don't you like it on the sly? Don't you like it till it hurts? Have I been on your mind? What's a voice without a song? Something in your head You've been fighting all along... I don't want to say it The news is not so good We'll never get away And even if we could We'd just play the tambourine Around an open flame Oversleep and burn To be back in the game' Cause summer never comes Nowhere near high noon And winter never comes Nor the harvest moon Raw sugar Don't want to die living in a high rise grave I'll pray to call home Save that date High rise grave No I'm not complaining Yes it could be worse Ferment on the wish bone Match the lips to the purse Neighborhood's a runway Fry the ass and thighs Dirty denim dealers Pushed behind the eyes' Cause summer never comes Nowhere near high noon And winter never comes Nor the harvest moon Raw sugar Don't want to die living in a high rise grave I'll pray to call home Save that date High rise grave Still I wear the red dress Paint my toes and twirl Take it back to old times When I was still a girl' Cause now I'm all baboon boys Coochie coochie coo Sort of wonder why I missed a kiss for you' Cause summer never comes (save that date) Winter never comes (high rise rate)
