Is this a riot or are you just pleased to see me?Why aren't we holding hands and talking sweet?I love you really, though I know no one believes meThere's chaos every time we meetOh, now look what, you've gone and doneYou're creating pandemoniumThat song you sing means everythingTo me, I'm living in ecstasyThe stars and the sun dance to your drumAnd now it's pandemoniumYou're crashing everywhere, it's like you're smashing chinaSkidding on an icy roadYou're major trouble since you were almost a minorI sometimes think we'll both explodeOh, now look what, you've gone and doneYou're creating pandemoniumThat song you sing means everythingTo me, I'm living in ecstasyMy world's gone mad, what did you do?Telling perfect strangers that I love youThe stars and the sun dance to your drumAnd now it's pandemoniumI can't make sense of anythingAll I know is the party's in full swingIf we both just stop for a minuteI declare war and then you'd win itTo tell you the truth, I thought I was shockproofUntil I saw what you get up toWhen you think about it, it's quite an achievementThat after all I still love youOh, now look what, you've gone and doneYou're creating pandemoniumThat song you sing means everythingTo me, I'm living in ecstasyMy world's gone mad, what did you do?Telling perfect strangers that I love youThe stars and the sun dance to your drumAnd now it's pandemonium
