Waitin' for a sign from youWaitin' for a signal to changeHave you forgotten what your love can do?Is this the end?Walkin' through the cityYour boots are high-heeled and are shinin' brightThe sunlight sparklin' on the shaft of your knifeFlower in the morning rainDying in my handWas it all in vain?Superstar in your own private movieI wanted just a minor partBut I'm no foolI know you're coolI never really wanted your heartYou're keeper of the keyNothing seems to bring you downIt's not that cool when I'm aroundFlower in the morning rainDying in my handWas it all in vain?Superstar in your own private movieI wanted just a minor partBut I'm no foolI know you're coolI never really wanted your heart
