Say goodnight and goSkipping beats, blushing cheeksI am strugglingDaydreaming bed scenes inThe corner cafeAnd then I'm left in bitsRecovering, tectonic tremblingYou get me every timeWhy'd you have to be so cute?It's impossible to ignore youMust you make me laugh so much?It's bad enough we get along so wellSay goodnight and goFollow you homeYou've got your headphones onAnd you're dancingGot lucky, beautiful shotYou're taking everything offWatch the curtains, wide openAnd you fall in the same routineFlicking through the TVRelaxed and recliningAnd you think you're aloneOh, why'd you have to be so cute?It's impossible to ignore youMust you make me laugh so much?It's bad enough we get along so wellSay goodnight and goOne of these daysYou'll miss your train and come stay with meIt's always say goodnight and goWe'll have drinks and talk about thingsAnd any excuse to stay awake with youYou'd sleep here, I'd sleep thereBut then the heating may be down againAt my convenienceWe'd be good, we'd be great together(Go)Why'd you have to be so cute?It's impossible to ignore youMust you make me laugh so much?It's bad enough we get along so wellSay goodnight and go(Why is it always, always?)Goodnight and go(Darling, not again)Go
