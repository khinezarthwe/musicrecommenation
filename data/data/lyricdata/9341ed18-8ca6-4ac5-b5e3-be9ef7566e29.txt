Once there was a dayWe were together all the wayAn endless path unbrokenBut now there is a timeA torture less sublimeOur souls are locked and frozenLet me goLet me goI tried but could not bringThe best of everythingToo breathless then to wonderI died a thousand timesFound guilty of no crimeNow everything is thunderDaytime, all I want is nighttimeAll I want is the nighttimeI don't need the daytimeBa-da-da-da, da-da-da-daDa-ba-da-da, da-da-da-da-daDa-ba-da-da, da-da-da-da-daDa-ba-da-da, da-da-da-da-daDa-ba-da-da, da-da-da-da-daDa-ba-da-da, da-da-da-da-daDa-ba-da-da, da-da-da-da-daDa-ba-da-da, da-da-da-da-daOnce we were years ahead, but now those thoughts are deadLet me go (Let me go)All hopeless fantasies are making fools of meLet me goI walk alone, and yet I never say goodbyeLet me go (Let me go)A change of heart, a change of mind, and heaven fell that nightLet me goThe best years of our livesThe hope of it survivesThe facts of life unspokenThe only game in townI'll turn the last card downAnd now the bank is broken
