Once there was a day We were together all the way An endless path unbroken But now there is a time A torture less sublime Our souls are locked and frozen Let me go Let me go I tried but could not bring The best of everything Too breathless then to wonder I died a thousand times Found guilty of no crime Now everything is thunder Daytime, all I want is nighttime All I want is the nighttime I don't need the daytime Ba-da-da-da, da-da-da-da Da-ba-da-da, da-da-da-da-da Da-ba-da-da, da-da-da-da-da Da-ba-da-da, da-da-da-da-da Da-ba-da-da, da-da-da-da-da Da-ba-da-da, da-da-da-da-da Da-ba-da-da, da-da-da-da-da Da-ba-da-da, da-da-da-da-da Once we were years ahead, but now those thoughts are dead Let me go ( Let me go) All hopeless fantasies are making fools of me Let me go I walk alone, and yet I never say goodbye Let me go ( Let me go) A change of heart, a change of mind, and heaven fell that night Let me go The best years of our lives The hope of it survives The facts of life unspoken The only game in town I'll turn the last card down And now the bank is broken
