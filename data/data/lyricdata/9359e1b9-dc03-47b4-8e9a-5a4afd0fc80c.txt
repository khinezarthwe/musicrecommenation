Welcome back to consciousnessWelcome back to the world of the livingBreathe deep as your thoughts are composedYou've been asleep without dreamingSearch your hands, feel your faceAnd thoughts without thinking, you're gone with no traceWe're victims of the human raceThe blind and the blind in unbearable spaceWe've been talking without saying anythingSo short a time this life of mineWe're around for nothingWe've been talking without saying anythingSo short a time this life of mineWe're around for nothingWho told you our immortal soulWas a place where our dreams were without control?Who told you that at the end of timeI'd be judged for wasting mine?"Okay my friend, it's onto the next life for you.""I guarantee you wonâ€™t be mourned."Who told you our immortal soulWas a place where our dreams whirl out of control?Who told you that at the end of timeI'd be damned for wasting mine?"Revenge is a meal best served cold."Welcome back to the land of NodWe're (not) here because of anything touched by GodDon't scream or lose inspirationWe're going to achieve ourselves real salvationWe want the treatment to beginStand up and prepare, or just slumber againWho told you our immortal soulWas a place where our dreams were without controlWho told you at the end of timeI'd be judged for wasting mine!Who told you our immortal soulWas a place where our dreams whirl out of controlWho told you at the end of timeI'd be damned for wasting mine!Wasting mineI'd be damned for wasting mineWasting my time!
