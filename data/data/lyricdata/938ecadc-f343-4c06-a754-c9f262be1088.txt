Faith, you're driving me awayYou do it everydayYou don't mean it butIt hurts like hellMy brain says I'm receiving painA lack of oxygenFrom my life supportMy iron lungWe're too young to fall asleepToo cynical to speakWe are losing itCan't you tell?We scratch our eternal itchA twentieth century bitchAnd we are grateful forOur iron lungThe headshrinkers, they want everythingMy uncle Bill, my Belisha beaconThe headshrinkers, they want everythingMy uncle Bill, my Belisha beaconSuck, suck your teenage thumbToilet trained and dumbWhen the power runs outWe'll just humThis, this is our new songJust like the last oneA total waste of timeMy iron lungThe headshrinkers, they want everythingMy uncle Bill, my Belisha beaconThe headshrinkers, they want everythingMy uncle Bill, my Belisha beaconAnd if you're frightened, you can be frightenedYou can be, it's okayAnd if you're frightened, you can be frightenedYou can be, it's okayThe headshrinkers, they want everythingMy uncle Bill, my Belisha beaconThe headshrinkers, they want everythingMy uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
