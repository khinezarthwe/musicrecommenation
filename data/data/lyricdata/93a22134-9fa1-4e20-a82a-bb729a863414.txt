I looked under chairsI've looked under tablesI've tried to find the keyTo fifty million fablesThey call me the seekerI been searching low and highI won't get to get what I'm after'Til the day I dieI asked Bobby DylanI asked The BeatlesI asked Timothy LearyBut he couldn't help me eitherThey call me the seekerI been searching low and highI won't get to get what I'm after'Til the day I diePeople tend to hate me'Cause I never smileAs I ransack their homesThey wanna shake my handFocusing on nowhereInvestigating milesI'm a seekerI'm a really desperate manI won't get to get what I'm after'Til the day I dieI learned how to raise my voice in angerYeah, but look at my face, ain't this a smile?I'm happy when life's good, and when it's bad I cryI got values, but I don't know how or whyI'm looking for meYou're looking for youWe're looking at each otherAnd we don't know what to doThey call me the seekerI been searching low and highI won't get to get what I'm after'Til the day I die
