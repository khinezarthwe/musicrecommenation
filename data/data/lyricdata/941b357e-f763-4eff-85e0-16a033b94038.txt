You had all of them on your side, didn't you? Didn't you? You believed in all your lies, didn't you? Didn't you?( The ruiner's got a lot to prove he's got nothing to lose and now he made you believe The ruiner's your only friend well he's the living end to the cattle he deceives The raping of the innocent you know the ruiner ruins everything he sees Now the only pure thing left in my fucking world is wearing your disease) How did you get so big? How did you get so strong? How did you get so hard? How did it get so long? You had to give them all a sign, didn't you? Didn't you? You had to covet what was mine, didn't you? Didn't you?( The ruiner's a collector he's an infecter serving his shit to his flies Maybe there will come a day when those that you keep blind will suddenly realize Maybe it's a part of me you took it to a place I hoped it would never go And maybe that fucked me up much more than you'll ever know) How did you get so big? How did you get so strong? How did you get so hard? How did it get so long? What you gave to me, my perfect ring of scars You know I can see what you really are You didn't hurt me, nothing can hurt me You didn't hurt me, nothing can stop me now You didn't hurt me, nothing can hurt me You didn't hurt me, nothing can stop me now You didn't hurt me, nothing can hurt me You didn't hurt me, nothing can stop me now You didn't hurt me, nothing can hurt me You didn't hurt me, nothing can stop me now You didn't hurt me, nothing can hurt me You didn't hurt me, nothing can stop me now You didn't hurt me, nothing can hurt me You didn't hurt me, nothing can stop me now
