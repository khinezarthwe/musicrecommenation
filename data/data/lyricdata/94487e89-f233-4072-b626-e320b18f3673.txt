On the wayTrying to get where I'd like to stayI'm always feeling steered awayBy someone trying to tell meWhat to say and do.I don't want it.I gotta go find my own way.I gotta go make my own mistakes.Sorry man for feeling,Feeling the way I do.(chorus)Oh yeah, oh yeah.Open wide and they'll shove inTheir meaning of life.Oh yeah, oh yeahBut not for me. I'll do it on my own.Oh yeah, oh yeahOpen wide and swallow their meaning of life.I can't make it work your way.Thanks but no thanks.By the way,I know your path has been tried and soIt may seem like the way to go.Me, I'd rather be foundTrying something new.And the bottom lineIn all of this seems to sayThere's no right and no wrong way.Sorry if I don't feel likeLiving the way you do.(chorus X2)
