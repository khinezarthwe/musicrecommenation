The Atlantic was born today And I'll tell you how The clouds above opened up And let it out I was standing on the surface of a perforated sphere When the water filled every hole And thousands upon thousands made an ocean Making islands where no islands should go Oh no Most people were overjoyed They took to their boats I thought it less like a lake And more like a moat The rhythm of my footsteps crossing flatlands to your door Have been silenced forevermore And the distance is quite simply much too far for me to row It seems farther than ever before Oh no I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closer I need you so much closer So come on, come on So come on, come on So come on, come on So come on, come on
