The Atlantic was born todayAnd I'll tell you howThe clouds above opened upAnd let it outI was standing on the surface of a perforated sphereWhen the water filled every holeAnd thousands upon thousands made an oceanMaking islands where no islands should goOh noMost people were overjoyedThey took to their boatsI thought it less like a lakeAnd more like a moatThe rhythm of my footsteps crossing flatlands to your doorHave been silenced forevermoreAnd the distance is quite simply much too far for me to rowIt seems farther than ever beforeOh noI need you so much closerI need you so much closerI need you so much closerI need you so much closerI need you so much closerI need you so much closerI need you so much closerI need you so much closerI need you so much closerI need you so much closerI need you so much closerI need you so much closerSo come on, come onSo come on, come onSo come on, come onSo come on, come on
