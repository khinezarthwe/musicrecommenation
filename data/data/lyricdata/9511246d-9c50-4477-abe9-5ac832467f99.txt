Why would he come back through the park?You thought that you saw him, but no you did notIt's not him who come across the sea to surprise youNot him who would know where in London to find youWith sadness so real that it populatesThe city and leaves you homeless againSteam from a cup and snow on the pathThe seasons have changed from the present to pastThe pastThe pastTurns whole to halfThe pastWhy would he come back through the park?You thought that you saw him, but no you did notWho can be sure of anything throughThe distance that keeps youFrom knowing the truthWhy would you think your boy could becomeThe man who could make you sure he was the one?The one...My one...My one...
