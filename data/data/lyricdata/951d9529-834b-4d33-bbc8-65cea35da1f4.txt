The long and winding roadThat leads to your doorWill never disappearI've seen that road beforeIt always leads me hereLead me to your doorThe wild and windy nightThat the rain washed awayHas left a pool of tearsCrying for the dayWhy leave me standing here?Let me know the wayMany times I've been aloneAnd many times I've criedAnyway, you'll never knowThe many ways I've triedAnd still they lead me backTo the long, winding roadYou left me standing hereA long, long time agoDon't leave me waiting hereLead me to your doorBut still they lead me backTo the long, winding roadYou left me standing hereA long, long time agoDon't keep me waiting hereLead me to your doorYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
