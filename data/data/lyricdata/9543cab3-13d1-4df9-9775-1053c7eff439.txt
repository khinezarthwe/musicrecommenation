They're almost falling over youWhy don't they call a truceWhatever they are trying to doIt's of little useThey're drowning you in complimentsTrying to furnish proofAnd though they speak with eloquenceThere is little truthYou're bright, you're strongYou know your right from wrongAt least to some degreeYou're wise, you're toughYou've heard their lies enoughYou smile in sympathyI'm watching your serenityThe way your soul transcendsTheir tedious obscenitiesYour patience never endsAnd as the night begins to fadeYou're heading for the doorFollowed by a sad paradeYou're on your own once moreYou're bright, you're strongYou know your right from wrongAt least to some degreeYou're wise, you're toughYou've heard their lies enoughYou smile in sympathy
