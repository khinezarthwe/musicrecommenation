Summer, summerSummer, summerSweet summer night and I'm stripped to my sheetsForehead is leaking, my AC squeaksAnd a voice from the clock says, "You're not gonna get tired"My bed is a pool and the wall's on fireSoakin' my head in the sink for awhileChills on my neck and it makes me smile butMy bones have to move and my skin's gotta breatheYou pick up the phone and I'm so relievedYou slide down your stairs to the heated streetAnd the sun has left us with slippery feetAnd I want to walk around with youAnd I want to walk around with youAnd be here with you, we're goingI'm not sure whereI'm not sure where, but I have seen you todayIt doesn't really matter, I'll go where you feelHunt for the breeze, get a midnight mealI point in the windows, you point out the parksRip off your sleeves and I'll ditch my socksWe'll dance to the songs from the cars as they passWeave through the cardboard, smell that trashWalking around in our summertime clothesNowhere to go when our bodies glowAnd we'll greet the dawn in its morning bluesWith purple yarn, you'll be sleeping soonAnd I want to walk around with youAnd I want to walk around with youWhen the sun goes down, we'll go out againWhen the sun goes down, we'll go out againWhen the sun goes down, we'll go out againWhen the sun goes down, we'll go out againWhen the sun goes down, we'll go out againWhen the sun goes down, we'll go out againWhen the sun goes down, we'll go out againWhen the sun goes down, we'll go out againWhen the sun goes down, we'll go out againWhen the sun goes down, we'll go out againWhen the sun goes down, we'll go out againWhen the sun goes down, we'll go out againWhen the sun goes down, we'll go out againWhen the sun goes down, we'll go out againWhen the sun goes down, we'll go out againWhen the sun goes down, we'll go out againDon't cool off, I like your warmthLet's leave the sound of the heat for the sound of the rainIt's easy to sleep when it whets my brainIt covers my rest with a saccharine sheenKissing the wind through my window screenThe restlessness calls, says that I cannot hideSo much on my mind that it spills outsideDo you want to go stroll down the financial street?Our clothes might get soaked, but the buildings sleepAnd there's no one pushing for a placeLet's meander at an easy paceAnd I want to walk around with youAnd I want to walk around with youI want to walk around with youI want to walk around with youI want to walk around with youI want to walk around with youJust you, just you, just you, just youJust you, just you, just you, just youJust you, just you, just you, just youJust you, just you, just you, just you
