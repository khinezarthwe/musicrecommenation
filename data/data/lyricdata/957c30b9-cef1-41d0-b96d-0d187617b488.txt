Oh, give us your vote Give us your vote If you know what's good for you Oh, give us your vote Give us your vote If you know what's good for you These are the lines That we straighten every year But it's the second time They've mapped the constellations And they search for you by night In the Deptford gravel pit And until the tramp finds Christ Injustice is my middle name'cause you don't need to change Your future's with us You don't need to change Your future's with us You look a wreck Left your key inside the door And my rook will check Across this black and white chess board'cause your English is good We can see it in your bones In this neighborhood We ain't driving you home'cause you don't need to change Your future's with us You don't need to change Oh, give us your vote Give us your vote'cause your English is good We can see it in your bones
