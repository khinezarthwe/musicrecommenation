Come down from the mountain, you have been gone too long The spring is upon us, follow my ornate song Settle down with me by the fire of my yearning You should come back home, back on your own now The world is alive now, in and outside our home You run through the forest settled before the sun Darling, I can barely remember you beside me You should come back home, back on your own now You should come back home, back on your own now In the evening light, when the woman of the woods came by To give to you the word of the old man In the morning tide, when the sparrow and the seagull fly And Jonathan and Evelyn get tired Lie to me if you will At the top of Barringer Hill Tell me anything you want, any old lie will do Call me back to, back to you Lie to me if you will At the top of Barringer Hill Tell me anything you want, any old lie will do Call me back to, back to you
