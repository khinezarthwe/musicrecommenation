Come down from the mountain, you have been gone too longThe spring is upon us, follow my ornate songSettle down with me by the fire of my yearningYou should come back home, back on your own nowThe world is alive now, in and outside our homeYou run through the forest settled before the sunDarling, I can barely remember you beside meYou should come back home, back on your own nowYou should come back home, back on your own nowIn the evening light, when the woman of the woods came byTo give to you the word of the old manIn the morning tide, when the sparrow and the seagull flyAnd Jonathan and Evelyn get tiredLie to me if you willAt the top of Barringer HillTell me anything you want, any old lie will doCall me back to, back to youLie to me if you willAt the top of Barringer HillTell me anything you want, any old lie will doCall me back to, back to you
