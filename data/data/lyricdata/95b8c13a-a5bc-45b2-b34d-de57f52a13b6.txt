Do you believe? Do you fade like a Dream?Let me hear you breatheLet me watch as you sleepThe sparrow's eyes.... Promises shift into judgmentsI cannot deny that you were designed for my punishmentsThe blood and the bodyControl the cut so it's seamlessShow me your heartShow me the way to complete thisTethered to a scene I treasure; can you help me?I sever God; it's perfect, it's never really perfectNow... I can finally be myself'Cause I don't want to be myselfFree my severed heart, give me you, I want itI cannot maintainA semblance of normal anymoreI'd rather feel painThan try to fit in with you anymoreI'll throw it all awayLike everybody elseI can finally be myself'Cause I don't want to be myselfFree my severed heart, give me you, I want it
