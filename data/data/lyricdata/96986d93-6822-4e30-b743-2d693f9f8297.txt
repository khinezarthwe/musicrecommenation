What was that sound ringing around your brainToday was just a blur, you've got a head like a ghost trainWhat was that sound ringing around your brainYou're here on your own, who you gonna find to blameYou're the outcastYou're the underclassBut you don't careBecause you're living fastYou're the uninvited guest who stays 'til the endI know you've got a problem that the devil sendsYou think they're talking about you but you don't know whoI'll be scraping their lives from the sole of my shoe tonightBring it on down, bring it down for meYour head's in a fish tank, your body and your mind can't breatheBring it on down, bring it down for meYour head's in a fish tank, your body and your mind can't breatheYou're the outcastYou're the underclassBut you don't careBecause you're living fastAnd you're the uninvited guest who stays 'til the endI know you've got a problem that the devil sendsYou think they're talking about you but you don't know whoI'll be scraping their lives from the sole of my shoe tonight
