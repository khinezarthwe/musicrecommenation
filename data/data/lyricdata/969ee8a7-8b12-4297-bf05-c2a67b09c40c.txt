A devil in a midnight massHe preyed behind stained glassA memory of Sunday classResurrected from the pastHold your breath and count to fourPinky swears don't work no moreFootsteps down the hallway floorGetting closer to my doorI was alive, but now I'm singingSilent Night for the rest of my lifeSilent Night for the rest of my lifeViolent Knight at the edge of your knife"Forgive me, Father" won't make it rightSilent Night for the rest of my lifeSilent Night at the edge of your knifeYou're guiltyA devil in a midnight massKilled the boy inside the manThe holy water in his handsCan never wash away his sinsHold your breath and count to fourPinky swears don't work no morePut my trust in God that dayNot the man that taught his wayI was alive, but now I'm singingSilent Night for the rest of my lifeSilent Night for the rest of my lifeViolent Knight at the edge of your knife"Forgive me, Father" won't make it rightSilent Night for the rest of my lifeSilent Night at the edge of your knifeYou're guiltyWhisper, whisper, don't make a soundYour bed is made, it's in the groundWhisper, whisper don't make a soundYour bed is made, it's in the groundWhisper, whisper, don't make a soundYour bed is made, it's in the groundWhisper, whisper don't make a soundYour bed is made, it's in the groundWhisper, whisper, don't make a soundYour bed is made, it's in the groundWhisper, whisper don't make a soundYour bed is made and it's in the ground
