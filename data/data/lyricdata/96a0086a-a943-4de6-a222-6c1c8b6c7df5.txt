I lie awakeI've gone to groundI'm watching pornIn my hotel dressing gownAnd now I dream of youBut I still believeThere's only enough for one in thisLonely hotel suiteThe journey's longAnd I feel so badI'm thinking back to the last day we had.Old moon fades into the newSoon I know that I'll be back with youI'm nearly with youI'm nearly with youWhen I'm weak I draw strength from youAnd when you're lost I know how to change your moodAnd when I'm down you breathe life over meEven though we're miles apart we are each other's destinyOn a clear dayI'll fly home to youI'm bending time getting back to youOld moon fades into the newAnd soon I know I'll be back with youI'm nearly with youI'm nearly with youWhen I'm weak I draw strength from youAnd when you're lost I know how to change your moodAnd when I'm down you breathe life over meEven though we're miles apart we are each other's destinyWhen I'm weak I draw strength from youAnd when you're lost I know how to change your moodAnd when I'm down you breathe life over meEven though we're miles apart we are each other's destinyI'll fly, I'll fly homeI'll fly home and I'll fly home
