Inner city sky rise over town at nightYou pushed me to the top floor so we could see the sightsI could tell that you wanted toJump in the poolJump in the poolI looked at you I knew you wanted toJump in the poolJump in the poolI push offI breathe inThe stillness turning awayDon't look backDon't pretendWe'll never take control againAnd we're falling beyond the horizonAnd only the water remainsThe fear is falling awayOn the poolside staring into glowing blueSwimsuit issues with my toes curled in the groovesI could tell that you wanted toJump in the poolJump in the poolI looked at you I knew you wanted toJump in the poolJump in the poolI push offI breathe inThe stillness turning awayDon't look backDon't pretendWe'll never take control againAnd we're falling beyond the horizonAnd only the water remainsThe fear is falling awayKeep breathingKeep searchingKeep holding onKeep breathingKeep livingKeep holding onI push offI breathe inThe stillness turning awayDon't look backDon't pretendWe'll never take control againAnd we're falling beyond the horizonAnd only the water remainsThe fear is falling away
