Community saw the best in meExchanging the common heartFor the salt in the seaChildren of the Sun on a highway of hopeThe beauty of coming togetherIn sorrowTahiti we don't got no nameTahiti we don't got no homeTahiti we don't got no moneyTahiti we don't got no honey"But we do the dishes and we make the bread""We are powdered ashes in the light of the beauty"He saidWear those dark glasses to help us seeHot tears rolling down and our arms are knittedAll around youCreatures of the night on a highway of hopeThe beauty that we'll leave each otherTomorrow
