I'm ever so lostI can't find my wayBeen searching, but I have never seenA turning, a turning from deceit'Cause the child roses likeTry to reveal what I could feelI can't understand myself anymore'cause I'm still feeling lonelyFeeling so unholy'Cause the child roses likeTry to reveal what I could feelAnd this lonelinessIt just won't leave me alone, oh noI'm fooling somebodyA faithless path I roamDeceiving to breathe this secretlyA silence, this silence I can't bear'Cause the child roses likeTries to reveal what I could feelAnd this lonelinessIt just won't leave me alone, oh noAnd this lonelinessIt just won't leave me aloneA lady of warA lady of war
