"It's in the trees!It's coming!"When I was a childRunning in the nightAfraid of what might beHiding in the darkHiding in the streetAnd of what was following me...Now hounds of love are huntingI've always been a cowardAnd I don't know what's good for meOh, here I go!It's coming for me through the treesHelp me, someoneHelp me, please!Take my shoes offAnd throw them in the lakeAnd I'll beTwo steps on the waterI found a foxCaught by dogsHe let me take him in my handsHis little heartIt beat so fastAnd I'm ashamed of running awayFrom nothing realI just can't deal with thisI'm still afraid to be thereAmong your hounds of loveAnd feel your arms surround meI've always been a cowardAnd never know what's good for meOh, here I go!Don't let me go!Hold me down!It's coming for me through the treesHelp me, darlingHelp me, please!Take my shoes offAnd throw them in the lakeAnd I'll beTwo steps on the waterI don't know what's good for meI don't know what's good for meI need your love, love, love, love, love, yeah!Your love!Take your shoes offAnd throw them in the lake!Do you know what I really need?Do you know what I really need?I need love, love, love, love, love, yeah
