There's no need for introductions No dark corridors of fame You'll find your fortune You might find some pain I wanna lie, lie together Feels like our last embrace In a world full of confusion Yeah, human race But I'd rather be here than be anywhere Is there anywhere better than here? You know, these feelings I've found, they are, oh, so rare Is there anywhere better than here? Sometimes life seems to tear us apart Don't wanna let you go Sometimes these feelings hit me, I start to cry' Cause I won't ever let you go My, my, my, my, we're multiplying Always living under some cloud Always on the eve of destruction Make you wanna scream out loud And as I watch the birds soar My lives in which it spun Oh, my, my, my, my, why am I still crying? Oh, another day has come But I'd rather be here than be anywhere Is there anywhere better than here? You know, these feelings I've found, they are, oh, so rare Is there anywhere better than here? Sometimes life seems to tear us apart Don't wanna let you go Sometimes these feelings hit me, I start to cry' Cause I won't ever let you go But I'd rather be here than be anywhere Is there anywhere better than here? You know, these feelings I've found, they are, oh, so rare Is there anywhere better than here? But I'd rather be here than be anywhere Is there anywhere better than here?
