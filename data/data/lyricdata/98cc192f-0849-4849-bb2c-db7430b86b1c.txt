Well I was sitting, waiting, wishing That you believed in superstitions Then maybe you'd see the signs But Lord knows that this world is cruel And I ain't the Lord, no I'm just a fool Learning loving somebody don't make them love you Must I always be waiting, waiting on you? Must I always be playing, playing your fool? I sing your songs I dance your dance I gave your friends all a chance Putting up with them wasn't worth never having you And maybe you been through this before But its my first time, so please ignore The next few lines 'cause they're directed at you I can't always be waiting, waiting on you I can't always be playing, playing your fool I keep playing your part, but its not my scene Want this plot to twist, I've had enough mystery Keep building me up, then shooting me down Well I'm already down Just wait a minute Just sitting waiting Just wait a minute Just sitting waiting Well if I was in your position I'd put down all my ammunition I'd wonder why it had taken me so long But Lord knows that I'm not you And if I was I wouldn't be so cruel' Cause waiting on love ain't so easy to do Must I always be waiting, waiting on you? Must I always be playing, playing your fool? No I can't always be waiting, waiting on you I can't always be playing, playing your fool, fool
