Just when you’ve finally forgotten you’re alive / your light (?) That’s exactly when they send you back It comes together only to fall apart You’ll start again You’ll start over For the others always only on the other side What makes a side? What makes another? And in Switzerland the orange trees Go by the sea Or are they lakes? But for the sake of the sunny mountainside that sits Across the water body From the mountain in the shade And the baby bathers push me mountains (?) For the valley it sends all swimming We’re reeling yes we’re spinning But importantly, together together together oh But importantly, together together together oh Things that are still Sometimes appear to move Things that are still Sometimes they appear to move
