Just when you’ve finally forgotten you’re alive / your light (?)That’s exactly when they send you backIt comes together only to fall apartYou’ll start againYou’ll start overFor the others always only on the other sideWhat makes a side?What makes another?And in Switzerland the orange treesGo by the seaOr are they lakes?But for the sake of the sunny mountainside that sitsAcross the water bodyFrom the mountain in the shadeAnd the baby bathers push me mountains (?)For the valley it sends all swimmingWe’re reeling yes we’re spinningBut importantly, together together together ohBut importantly, together together together ohThings that are stillSometimes appear to moveThings that are stillSometimes they appear to move
