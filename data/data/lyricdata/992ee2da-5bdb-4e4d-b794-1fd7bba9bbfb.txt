So hard finding inspirationI knew you'd find me cryingTell those girls with rifles for mindsThat their jokes don't make me laughThey only make me feel like dyingIn an unguarded momentSo long, long between miragesI knew you'd find me drinkingTell those men with horses for heartsThat their jibes don't make me bleedThey only make me feel like shrinkingIn an unguarded momentSo deep, deep without a meaningI knew you'd find me leavingTell those friends with cameras for eyesThat their hands don't make me hangThey only make me feel like breathingIn an unguarded momentIn an unguarded momentIn an unguarded momentIn an unguarded momentIn an unguarded momentIn an unguarded momentIn an unguarded moment(In an unguarded moment)In an unguarded moment(In an unguarded moment)In an unguarded moment
