We are here, we can loveWe share somethingI'm sure that you meanThe world to meYour name was the oneThat was always chosenYour words and their kindnessHave set me freeShame has a holdThat's kept us frozenYou opened my eyes to a worldThat I could believeAnd words can leave you broken insideYou'll have to decideI'm hanging on to my prideWe are here, we can loveWe share somethingI'm sure that you meanThe world to meWhen you get what you needThere's no way of knowingWhat you'll haveIs another hole to feedThe games that were playedHave left us hopingThe gift that we have, the lifeThat we breatheThis world can leave you broken insideWith nowhere to hideI'm hanging on to my prideWe are hereWe've been chosenWe've been blessed with a placeWe need to find and then openWe are here, we can loveWe share somethingI'm sure that you meanThe world to meWhen you get what you needThere's no way of knowingWhat you'll haveIs another hole to feed
