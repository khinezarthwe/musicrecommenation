You look so defeated lying there in your new twin-sized bedWith a single pillow underneath your single headI guess you decided that that old queen was more space than you would needNow it's in the alley behind your apartment with a sign that says it's freeAnd I hope you have more luck with this than meYou used to think that someone would come alongAnd lay beside you in the space that they belongBut the other side of the mattress and box springs stayed like newAnd what's the point of holding on to what never gets usedOther than a sick desire for self-abuseAnd I try not to worryBut you've got me terrifiedIt's like we're in some kind of hurryTo say goodbye, to say goodbye, to say goodbyeYou look so defeated lying there in your new twin-sized bedYou look so defeated lying there in your new twin-sized bed
