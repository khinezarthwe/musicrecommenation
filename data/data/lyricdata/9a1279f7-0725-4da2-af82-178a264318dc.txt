Hold it, I'm about to drop offLet me tell you my last thoughtDrift into a deep fogLost where I forgot to, hold itI can feel you most when I'm aloneComing home 'cause I want toHang out with a starletStare up at the ceilingPreview of the screeningFlashback of a feelingSixth sense of a callingHeard you fuck through the wallI heard you fuckWhen I'm boredI send vibrationsIn your directionThrough the satellite mindWhen I'm boredI send vibrationsIn your directionThrough the satellite mindI'm not suicidalI just can't get out of bedI drift into a deep fogLost where I forgot to, hold itI can feel you most when I'm aloneI can feel your ghost when I'm aloneComing home 'cause I want toHang out with a starletStare up at the ceilingHiding and revealingFlashback of a feelingSick sense of a callingHeard you fuck through the wallI heard you fuckWhen I'm boredI send vibrationsIn your directionThrough the satellite mindWhen I'm boredI send vibrationsIn your directionThrough the satellite mindWhen your voiceBecame vibrationsThrough the satellite mindThrough the satellite mindIt sounded like mine...
