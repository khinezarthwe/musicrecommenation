Hold it, I'm about to drop off Let me tell you my last thought Drift into a deep fog Lost where I forgot to, hold it I can feel you most when I'm alone Coming home 'cause I want to Hang out with a starlet Stare up at the ceiling Preview of the screening Flashback of a feeling Sixth sense of a calling Heard you fuck through the wall I heard you fuck When I'm bored I send vibrations In your direction Through the satellite mind When I'm bored I send vibrations In your direction Through the satellite mind I'm not suicidal I just can't get out of bed I drift into a deep fog Lost where I forgot to, hold it I can feel you most when I'm alone I can feel your ghost when I'm alone Coming home 'cause I want to Hang out with a starlet Stare up at the ceiling Hiding and revealing Flashback of a feeling Sick sense of a calling Heard you fuck through the wall I heard you fuck When I'm bored I send vibrations In your direction Through the satellite mind When I'm bored I send vibrations In your direction Through the satellite mind When your voice Became vibrations Through the satellite mind Through the satellite mind It sounded like mine...
