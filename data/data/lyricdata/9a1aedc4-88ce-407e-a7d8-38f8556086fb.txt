Every night my dream's the sameSame old city with a different nameMen are coming to take me awayI don't know why, but I know I can't stayThere's a weight that's pressing downLate at night you can hear the soundEven the noise you make when you sleepCan't swim across a river so deepThey know my name 'cause I told it to themBut they don't know where and they don't know whenIt's coming when it's comingThere's a fear I keep so deepKnew its name since before I could speak, oh-oh-oh-ohThey know my name 'cause I told it to themBut they don't know where and they don't know whenIt's coming, oh, when, but it's coming, keep the car runningIf some night I don't come homePlease don't think I've left you aloneThe same place animals go when they dieYou can't climb across a mountain so highThe same city where I go when I sleepYou can't swim across a river so deepThey know my name 'cause I told it to themBut they don't know where and they don't know whenIt's coming, oh, when is it coming? Keep the car runningKeep the car running, keep the car running
