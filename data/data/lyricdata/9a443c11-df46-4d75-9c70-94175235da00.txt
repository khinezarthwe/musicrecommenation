From the moment you said, "Why haven't you kissed me yet?"I knew I'd wipe that paint from your lipsI stare the lids off your eyes, go down on your dirty mindAnd end up between your hipsHandfuls of sweat-tangled hair, anytime, anywhereI wanna lick you too much, babyI just play all alone, whispering for your moanForced to crawl down this line just to touchI can get inI can't get outI can get inI can't get outI'm just sweating my sheets, I hate to see you leaveBut I love to watch you go, babyTwisted secret lives, the way you bat your eyesGivin' head, givin' headWatch you come from above, I'm so needy for loveI'm desperate, greedy in slaveryI sneak around from behind, I got a one-track mindWe got a skin-on-skin thing, babyI wanna lick you too much, I wanna lick you too muchI hear you comin', ooh, ahh, babyI wanna lick you too much, I wanna lick you too muchI hear you comin', ooh, ahh
