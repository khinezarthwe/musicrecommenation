Yeah! His guitar slung across his back His dusty boots, and as his Cadillac, A-flamin hair just a-blowin' in the wind Ain't see a bed in so long it's a sin, He left home when he was seventeen, The rest of the world he had longed to see-ah And everybody who knows, boss, A rolling stone gathers no moss! Now you'd probably call him a tramp, But it goes a little deeper than that! He's a highway chile, yeah! Now some people say he had a girl back home Who messed him around and did him pretty wrong They me tell it kind of hurt him bad Kinda made him feel pretty sad I couldn't say what went through his mind Anyway, he left the world behind-ah And everybody knows the same old story In love and war you can't lose with glory Now you'd probably, uh, call him a tramp, but uh, I know it goes a little deeper than that He's a highway chile! Walk on, brother Yeah! Whoa, yeah Walk on down the highway His old guitar slung across his back His dusty boots as his Cadillac Flamin' hair just a-blowin' in the wind Ain't seen a bed in so long it's a sin Now you probably call him a tramp, But I know it goes a little deeper than that! He's a highway chile! Walk on brother Don't let no one stop you Highway chile Yeah, yeah, yeah Highway chile Rolling stone Go on down the highway, go ahead on Highway chile Yeah, yeah Highway chile Yeah, hey Ow!
