There's a girl that wants to stop Been thinking about having a couple of kids Comb a brush around their heads in the morning To be needed, simply and with meaning Her name is Karen Been on the road for so long She wants to live in a place that has a number and a name Find lovers and anchor before the courage is gone She really loves him, Prescilla She really loves him, Prescilla She really loves him, I tell you To live life outside the world To break the cross that bears her name She's not your queen anymore (queen of the highway) Needs something better than learning away Gone away Queen of the Highway
