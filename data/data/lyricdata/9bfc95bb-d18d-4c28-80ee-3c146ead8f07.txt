I should have known that this would happen from the start This kind of function's going to have to fall apart I guess before I would have sworn that we were friends Maybe this problem points toward some larger trend But I still don't understand, what this whole thing's about And all the words that you said, are somehow stuck in my mouth This was going so well, but I don't know what I did All I really can tell is I've been hit! I've been hit! I've been hit! Well there's only so much drama I can stand And this is just about as far as I will bend So get your hands off my lapel, because I think it's time to go You oughta know better, you know, you oughta know And I still don't understand, what this whole thing's about And all the words that you said, are somehow stuck in my mouth This was going so well, but I don't know what I did All I really can tell is I've been hit! I've been hit! I've been hit! As I was falling down the stairs and out the door I guess I heard you yell my name, but I'm not sure You know, before I could have sworn that we were friends Somehow that's how these parties always seem to end But I still don't understand, what this whole thing's about And all the words that you said, are somehow stuck in my mouth This was going so well, but I don't know what I did All I really can tell is that I always get hit And I still don't understand, what this whole thing's about And all the words that you said, are somehow stuck in my mouth I guess I might take it back, but I'm not sure what I did All I know for a fact is I've been hit! I've been hit! I've been hit!
