I can't use what I can't abuseAnd I can't stop when it comes to youYou burned me out, but I'm back at your doorLike Joan of Arc coming back for moreI nearly diedI nearly diedI nearly diedI came to cut you upI came to knock you downI came around to tear your little world apartI came to shut you upI came to drag you downI came around to tear your little world apartAnd break your soul apartAh, you burn and burn to get under my skinYou've gone too far now, I won't give inYou crucify me, but I'm back in your bedLike Jesus Christ coming back from the deadI nearly diedI nearly diedI nearly diedI came to knock you upI came to cut you downI came around to tear your little world apartI came to rip you upI came to shut you downI came around to tear your little world apartAnd break your soul apartI nearly diedI nearly diedI nearly diedI came to cut you upI came to knock you downI came around to tear your little world apartI came to shut you upI came to suck you downI came around to tear your little world apartTear your little world apartTear your little world apartAnd break your soul apartI can't stop when it comes to youI can't stop when it comes to youWhen it comes to you...
