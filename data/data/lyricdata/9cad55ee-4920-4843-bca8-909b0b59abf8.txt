And with the early dawn moving right alongI couldn't buy an eyeful of sleepAnd in the aching night under satellitesI was not receivedBuilt with stolen parts, a telephone in my heartSomeone get me a priestTo put my mind to bed, this ringing in my headIs this a cure or is this a disease?Nail in my handFrom my creatorYou gave me lifeNow show me how to liveNail in my handFrom my creatorYou gave me lifeNow show me how to liveAnd in the after birth on the quiet earthLet the stains remind youYou thought you made a man, you better think againBefore my role defines youNail in my handFrom my creatorYou gave me lifeNow show me how to liveNail in my handFrom my creatorYou gave me lifeNow show me how to liveAnd in your waiting hands I will landAnd roll out of my skinAnd in your final hours I will standReady to beginReady to beginReady to beginReady to beginNail in my handFrom my creatorYou gave me lifeNow show me how to liveNail in my handFrom my creatorYou gave me lifeNow show me how to liveShow me how to liveShow me how to liveShow me how to liveShow me how to live
