I got buttons bursting in the air I got apple orchards everywhere I got grapes swinging from the vine Swinging in a line, lined up in the sunshine I'm on time, fresh, fast A sweetheart, I'll watch your back I'm all swing, a swing from the shoestrings Right or wrong, to me it's the same thing You, especially, you, especially, you, especially You have my loyalties You in wartime, love, peace I need to walk you down the street I'm right here, I'll watch your back In case the wind blows off your hat You - you're on time Your eyes are like diamond mine Deep and bright inside I got buttons bursting in the air I got apple orchards everywhere I got grapes, swinging from the vine Swinging in a line, lined up in the sunshine I got buttons bursting in the air Ideas run fingers through my hair And my shoes are ready to move, My shoes are ready to move... Swing it low, swing it low, swing it low low low Swing it low, swing it low, swing it low low low...
