In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose Kill the headlights and put it in neutral Stock car flaming with a loser and the cruise control Babies in Reno with the vitamin D Got a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseat Someone came in saying I'm insane to complain About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt Don't believe everything that you breathe You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve So shave your face with some mace in the dark Savin' all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park Yo Cut it Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby So why don't you kill me? ( Double-barrel buckshot) Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby So why don't you kill me? Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare Ban all the music with a phoney gas chamber' Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job The daytime crap of the folksinger slob He hung himself with a guitar string A slab of turkey-neck and it's hanging from a pigeon wing You can't write if you can't relate Trade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite That's choking on the splinters Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby So why don't you kill me? ( Get crazy with the Cheeze Whiz) Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby So why don't you kill me? ( Drive-by body-pierce) Yo, bring it on down, soy( I'm a driver, I'm a winner Things are gonna change I can feel it) Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby So why don't you kill me? ( I can't believe you) Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby So why don't you kill me? ( Uh) Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby So why don't you kill me? ( Oh, sprechen Sie Deutsch, baby?) Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby So why don't you kill me? ( You know what I'm sayin'?)
