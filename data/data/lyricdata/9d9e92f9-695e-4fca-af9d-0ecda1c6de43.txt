In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkeyButane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkieWith the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetablesDog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhoseKill the headlights and put it in neutralStock car flaming with a loser and the cruise controlBabies in Reno with the vitamin DGot a couple of couches, sleep on the loveseatSomeone came in saying I'm insane to complainAbout a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirtDon't believe everything that you breatheYou get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeveSo shave your face with some mace in the darkSavin' all your food stamps and burning down the trailer parkYoCut itSoy un perdedor, I'm a loser babySo why don't you kill me? (Double-barrel buckshot)Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser babySo why don't you kill me?Forces of evil in a bozo nightmareBan all the music with a phoney gas chamber'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flagOne's on the pole, shove the other in a bagWith the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-jobThe daytime crap of the folksinger slobHe hung himself with a guitar stringA slab of turkey-neck and it's hanging from a pigeon wingYou can't write if you can't relateTrade the cash for the beef for the body for the hateAnd my time is a piece of wax falling on a termiteThat's choking on the splintersSoy un perdedor, I'm a loser babySo why don't you kill me? (Get crazy with the Cheeze Whiz)Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser babySo why don't you kill me? (Drive-by body-pierce)Yo, bring it on down, soy(I'm a driver, I'm a winnerThings are gonna change I can feel it)Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser babySo why don't you kill me? (I can't believe you)Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser babySo why don't you kill me? (Uh)Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser babySo why don't you kill me? (Oh, sprechen Sie Deutsch, baby?)Soy un perdedor, I'm a loser babySo why don't you kill me? (You know what I'm sayin'?)
