How long before I get in?Before it starts, before I begin?How long before you decide?Before I know what it feels like?Where to, where do I go?If you never try, then you'll never knowHow long do I have to climbUp on the side of this mountain of mine?Look up, I look up at nightPlanets are moving at the speed of lightClimb up, up in the treesEvery chance that you get is a chance you seizeHow long am I going to standWith my head stuck under the sand?I'll start before I can stopBefore I see things the right way upAll that noise and all that soundAll those places I got foundAnd birds go flying at the speed of soundTo show you how it all beganBirds came flying from the undergroundIf you could see it, then you'd understandIdeas that you'll never findAll the inventors could never designThe buildings that you put upJapan and China all lit upThe sign that I couldn't readOr a light that I couldn't seeSome things you have to believeBut others are puzzles, puzzling meAll that noise and all that soundAll those places I got foundAnd birds go flying at the speed of soundTo show you how it all beganBirds came flying from the undergroundIf you could see it, then you'd understandOh, when you see it, then you'll understandAll those signs, I knew what they meantSome things you can't inventSome get made and some get sent, oohAnd birds go flying at the speed of soundTo show you how it all beganBirds came flying from the undergroundIf you could see it, then you'd understandOh, when you see it, then you'll understand
