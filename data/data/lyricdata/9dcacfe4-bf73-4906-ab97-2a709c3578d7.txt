A sea of waves We hug the same plank( Saw your end) Just as I rehearsed Over in my brain( Saw your end) The waves Suck You in And you drown If, like, you Should sink down beneath I'll swim down Would you, you? You hang the anchors Over my neck( Saw your end) I liked it at first But the more you laughed The crazier I came (saw your end) The waves Suck You in Then you drown If, like, you Should sink down beneath I'll swim down Would you? Is that what you want? You Is that what you want? Waves Waves It's like If, like, you Should sink down beneath I'll swim down Would you? Is that you want? Would you? Is that what you want? You You Escape Below Escape Below
