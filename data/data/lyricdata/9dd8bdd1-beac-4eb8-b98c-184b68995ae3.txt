If you were a season you would be in bloomI wish I had good reason to see you soonNo need to convince me that you were a catchI bought my ticket and so at lastWho was it that said that love conquers all?Oh, he was a fool 'cause it doesn't add upShould I believe you told a lieOn the way to my heart and on the way back?Are my eyes the coldest blue?You said once this was trueIf it is I don't know what I'll do'Cause I'm stuck with them and they're stuck on youWas I quite bad that nothing could never challenged anyoneOr was I a lazy lazy snake?Do you want me to be a gentle diplomat?Oh, you can beg and you can pleadAre my eyes the coldest blue?You said once this was trueAnd if it is I don't know what I'll do'Cause I'm stuck with them and they're stuck on youAre my eyes the coldest blue?You said once this was trueIf it is I don't know what I'll do'Cause I'm stuck with them and you're stuck on you'Cause I'm stuck with them and they're stuck on youI'm stuck with them and they're stuck on youI'm stuck with them and they're stuck on you
