Monday morning wake up knowing that you've got to go to school Tell your mum what to expect, she says it's right out of the blue Do you went to work in Debenham's, because that's what they expect Start in Lingerie, and Doris is your supervisor And the head said that you always were a queer one from the start For Careers you say you went to be remembered for your art Your obsessions get you known throughout the school for being strange Making life-size models of the Velvet Underground in clay In the queue for lunch they take the piss, you've got no appetite And the rumour is you never go with boys and you are tight So they jab you with a fork, you drop the tray and go berserk While you're cleaning up the mess the teacher's looking up your skirt Hey, you been used Are you calm? Settle down Write a song, I'll sing along Soon you will know that you are sane You're on top of the world again Monday morning wake up knowing that you've got to go to school Tell your mum what to expect, she said it's right out of the blue You went to work in C& A, 'cause that's what they expect Move to Lingerie and take a feel off Joe the Storeman Tell Veronica the secrets of the boy you never kissed She's got everything to gain 'cause she's a fat girl with a lisp She sticks up for you when you get aggravation from the snobs' Cause you can't afford a blazer, girl, you're always wearing clogs At the interval you lock yourself away inside a room Head of English gets you, asks you, " What the hell do you think you're doing?" Do you think you're better then the other kids? Well get outside." You've got permission - you've got to make the bastard think he's right Hey, you been used Write a song, I'll sing along Are you calm? Settle down Soon you will know that you are sane You're on top of the world again Oh you're cool and you know You're a star and you'll go far Listen to me as a friend Not just a boy who plays guitar You're on top of the world again
