Yesterday I got lost in the circusFeeling like such a messAnd now I'm downI'm just hanging on the cornerI can't help but reminisce'Cause when you're goneAll the colors fadeWhen you're goneNo New Year's Day paradeYou're goneColors seem to fadeYour mama called, she saidThat you're downstairs cryingFeeling like such a messYa, I hear yaIn the background bawlingWhat happened to your sweet summer time dressI know we allWe all got our faultsWe get locked in our vaultsAnd we stayWhen you're goneAll the colors fadeWhen you're goneNo New Year's Day paradeYou're goneColors seem to fadeColors seem to fade
