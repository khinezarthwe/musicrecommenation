There once was a notePure and easyPlayin' so free, like a breath rippling byThe note is eternalI hear it it sees meForever we blendAnd forever we dieI listened and I heardMusic in a wordAnd words when you played your guitarThe noise that I was hearing was a million people cheeringAnd a child flew past me riding in a starAs people assembleCivilizationIs trying to find a new way to dieBut killing is reallyMerely scene changerAll men are boredWith other men's liesI listened and I heardMusic in a wordAnd words when you played your guitarThe noise I was hearing was a million people cheeringAnd a child flew past me riding in a starGas on the hillsideOil in the teacupWatch all the chords of life lose their joyDistortion becomes somehowPure in its wildnessThe note that began allCan also destroyWe all know successWhen we all find our own dreamsAnd our love is enoughTo knock down any wallsAnd the future's been seenAs men try to realizeThe simple secret of the note in us allI listened and I heardMusic in a wordAnd words when you played your guitarThe noise I was hearing was a million people cheeringAnd a child flew past me riding in a starThere once was a notePure and easyPlaying so free, like a breath rippling byThere once was a noteListen(repeat 18 times)
