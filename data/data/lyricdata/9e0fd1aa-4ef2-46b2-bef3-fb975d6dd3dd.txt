The light was leaving in the west it was blueThe children’s laughter sangSkipping just like the stones they threwTheir voices echoed across the wavesIt’s getting lateIt was just another nightWith a sunset and a moonriseNot so far behindTo give us just enough lightTo lay down underneath the starsWe listened to Papa’s translationsOf the stories across the skyWe drew our own constellationsThe west winds often last too longAnd when they calm downNothing ever feels the sameSheltered under the Kamani treeWaiting for the passing rainClouds keep moving to uncover the seaOf stars up above us chasing the day awayA way to find the stories that we sometimes needListen close enough and all else fadesFades awayIt was just another nightWith a sunset and a moonriseNot so far behindTo give us just enough lightTo lay down underneath the starsListen to all translationsOf the stories across the skyWe drew our own constellations
