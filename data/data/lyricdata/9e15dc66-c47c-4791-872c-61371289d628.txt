One more little one, I'll go down And stay down And sleep the rest of the day Dream new music to calm down And stay down And keep evil away I can hear you asleep Changing your shape Dissolved in some dream As a new one appears To take you along Where you've never been1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 Moonlight tonight Seems to belong to me' Cause I Even though soon can sleep I need some company One hit wouldn't hurt a bit I'll slow down And sleep the rest of the time If it's good shit you won't know And I won't know The fact that I'll die If I seem to be reckless with myself It's the fault of no one All things have a place Under the moon As well as the sun One more little one I love you
