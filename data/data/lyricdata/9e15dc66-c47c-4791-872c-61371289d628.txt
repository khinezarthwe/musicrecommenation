One more little one, I'll go downAnd stay downAnd sleep the rest of the dayDream new music to calm downAnd stay downAnd keep evil awayI can hear you asleepChanging your shapeDissolved in some dreamAs a new one appearsTo take you alongWhere you've never been1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7Moonlight tonightSeems to belong to me'Cause IEven though soon can sleepI need some companyOne hit wouldn't hurt a bitI'll slow downAnd sleep the rest of the timeIf it's good shit you won't knowAnd I won't knowThe fact that I'll dieIf I seem to be reckless with myselfIt's the fault of no oneAll things have a placeUnder the moonAs well as the sunOne more little one I love you
