Waiting for a beamTo break through hereA chain way visionAll bright and clearAnd they talkAnd they danceI was expecting something pureWith a golden hairArms full of braceletsAnd smoke in the airAnd they talkAnd they danceHere comes darknessJust afternoonWaiting for a signIf I survive, I’ll worship the moonOr somethingAnythingThis must be itLong for blissFirst it was so quietNow I know I’m not alone in hereAnd they talkedAnd they dancedTwo omens collide in my open handMaking me a viewerI am what I have seenAnd they talkAnd they danceYour hand on my hipsSpeak friendly to meI’ve been studying for yearsPatientlyIs this as far as you can take me?This must be itLong for blissFirst it was so quietNow I know I’m not alone in hereAnd they talkedAnd they dancedThis must be itLong for blissFirst it was so quietNow I know I’m not alone in hereAnd they talkedAnd they dancedThis must be itLong for blissFirst it was so quietNow I know I’m not alone in hereThis must be itLong for blissFirst it was so quietNow I know I’m not alone in hereAnd they talkedAnd they danced
