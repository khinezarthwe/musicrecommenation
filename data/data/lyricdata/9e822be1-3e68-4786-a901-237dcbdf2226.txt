"Show me, show me, show me how you do that trickThe one that makes me scream", she said"The one that makes me laugh", she saidAnd threw her arms around my neck"Show me how you do itAnd I'll promise you, I'll promise thatI'll run away with youI'll run away with you"Spinning on that dizzy edgeI kissed her face, I kissed her headAnd dreamed of all the different waysI had to make her glow"Why are you so far away?", she said"Why won't you ever knowThat I'm in love with you?That I'm in love with you?"You - soft and onlyYou - lost and lonelyYou - strange as angelsDancing in the deepest oceansTwisting in the waterYou're just like a dreamYou're just like a dreamDaylight licked me into shapeI must've been asleep for daysAnd moving lips to breathe her nameI opened up my eyesAnd found myself alone, aloneAlone above a raging seaStole the only girl I lovedAnd drowned her deep inside of meYou - soft and onlyYou - you're lost and lonelyYou - just like heaven
