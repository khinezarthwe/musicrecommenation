Her green plastic watering canFor a fake Chinese rubber plantIn the fake plastic earthThat she bought from a rubber manIn a town full of rubber plansTo get rid of itselfIt wears her outIt wears her outIt wears her outIt wears her outShe lives with a broken manA cracked polystyrene manWho just crumbles and burnsHe used to do surgeryFor girls in the eightiesBut gravity always winsAnd it wears him outIt wears him outIt wears him outIt wearsShe looks like the real thingShe tastes like the real thingMy fake plastic loveBut I can't help the feelingI could blow through the ceilingIf I just turn and runAnd it wears me outIt wears me outIt wears me outIt wears me outAnd if I could be who you wantedIf I could be who you wantedAll the timeAll the time
