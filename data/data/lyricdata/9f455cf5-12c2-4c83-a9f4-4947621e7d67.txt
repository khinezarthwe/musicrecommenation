Been hidin' out and layin' lowIt's nothing new to meWell, you can always find a place to goIf you can keep your sanityThey break down the doors and they rape my rights butThey won't touch meThey scream and yell and fight all nightYou can't tell meI lose my head, I close my eyesThey won't touch me'Cause I got somethin' 've been buildin' up insideFor so fuckin' longThey're out ta get meThey won't catch meI'm fuckin' innocentThey won't break meSometimes it's easy to forget where you're goin'Sometimes it's harder to leaveAnd ev'rytime you think you know just what you're doin'That's when your troubles exceedThey push me in a corner just to get me to fight butThey won't touch meThey preach and yell and fight all nightYou can't tell meI lose my head, I close my eyesThey won't touch me'Cause I got somethin' I've been buildin' up insideI'm already goneThey're out ta get meThey won't catch me'Cause I'm innocentThey won't break meNo, noOh, no, no, no, no, no, noNo, oh, no, no, noLet me see you trySome people got a chip on their shoulderAnd some would say it was meBut I didn't buy that fifth of whiskey that you gave meSo I'd be quick to disagreeThey're out ta get meThey won't catch meI'm fuckin' innocentThey won't break meThey're out ta get meThey won't catch me'Cause I'm innocentSo you can suck meTake that one to heart
