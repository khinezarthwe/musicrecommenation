So I'm thereCharging around with a juggernaut browOverdraft speeches and deadlines to makeCramming commitments like cats in a sackTelephone burn and a purposeful gaitWhen out of a doorway the tentacles stretchOf a song that I know and the world moves in slow-moStraight to my head like the first cigarette of the dayAnd it's you and it's MayAnd we're sleeping through the dayAnd I'm five years agoAnd three thousand miles awayDo I have time? A man of my calibre?Stood in the street like a sleepwalking teenager?No. And I dealt with this years agoI took a hammer to every mementoBut image on image like beads on a rosaryPull through my head as the music takes holdAnd the sickener hits, I could work till I breakBut I love the bones of you, that I will never escapeAnd it's you and it's MayAnd we're sleeping through the dayAnd I'm five years agoAnd three thousand miles awayAnd I can't move my armFor the fear that you will wakeAnd I'm five years agoAnd three thousand miles awayAnd I'm five years agoAnd three thousand miles awayAnd I'm five years agoAnd three thousand miles awayAnd it's you and its MayAnd we're sleeping through the dayAnd I'm five years agoAnd three thousand miles away
