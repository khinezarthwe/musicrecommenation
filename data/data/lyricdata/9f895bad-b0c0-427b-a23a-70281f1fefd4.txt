A dustland fairytale beginningOr just another white trash county kiss'61, long brown hair and foolish eyesHe looked just like you'd want him toSome kind of slick chrome American princeA blue jean serenadeAnd Moon River what'd you do to me?I don't believe youSaw Cinderella in a party dressBut she was lookin' for a nightgownI saw the devil wrappin' up his handsHe's getting ready for the showdownI saw the minute that I turned awayI got my money on a pawn tonightA change came in disguiseOf revelation, set his soul on fireShe says she always knew he'd come aroundAnd the decades disappear like sinking shipsBut we persevere, God gives us hopeBut we still fear what we don't knowThe mind is poisonCastles in the sky sit stranded, vandalizedWith drawbridges closin'Saw Cinderella in a party dressBut she was lookin' for a nightgownI saw the devil wrappin' up his handsHe's getting ready for the showdownI saw the ending when they turned the pageI threw my money and I ran awayStraight to the valley of a great divideOut where the dreams all hideOut where the wind don't blowOut here the good girls diedAnd the sky won't snowOut here the bird don't singOut here the field don't growOut here the bell don't ringOut here the bell don't ringOut here the good girls diedNow Cinderella don't you go to sleepIt's such a bitter form of refugeAh, don't you know the kingdom's under siegeAnd everybody needs you?Is there still magic in the midnight sunOr did you leave it back in '61?In the cadence of a young man's eyesOut where the dreams all hide
