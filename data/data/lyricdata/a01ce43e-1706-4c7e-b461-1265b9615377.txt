Words fall from my mouthLike plates from shaking handsSmash upon the silenceOf the smooth naked canalI'm evil and a heathenI'm evil and a heathenI'm a heathen and evil like youThere's not a lotNot a lot I couldn't doI like how you pretendThat the end will be the endSo fill your thirstDrink a curseTo the death of death insteadI'm evil and a heathenI'm evil and a heathenI'm a heathen and evil like youThere's not a lotNot a lot I wouldn't doUtrecht led me to the Sacre CoeurWhere the smoke curled roundNow the ice blows off Lake MichiganWhen the ice blowsThe ice flows knocks you downYour teeth are black with wineAs you place those lips on mineAnd the moon hangs heavy and forbidden highOn the night of our livesI'm evil and a heathenI'm evil and a heathenI'm a heathen and evil like youThere's not a lotNot a lot we couldn't do
