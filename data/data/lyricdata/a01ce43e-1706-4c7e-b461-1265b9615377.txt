Words fall from my mouth Like plates from shaking hands Smash upon the silence Of the smooth naked canal I'm evil and a heathen I'm evil and a heathen I'm a heathen and evil like you There's not a lot Not a lot I couldn't do I like how you pretend That the end will be the end So fill your thirst Drink a curse To the death of death instead I'm evil and a heathen I'm evil and a heathen I'm a heathen and evil like you There's not a lot Not a lot I wouldn't do Utrecht led me to the Sacre Coeur Where the smoke curled round Now the ice blows off Lake Michigan When the ice blows The ice flows knocks you down Your teeth are black with wine As you place those lips on mine And the moon hangs heavy and forbidden high On the night of our lives I'm evil and a heathen I'm evil and a heathen I'm a heathen and evil like you There's not a lot Not a lot we couldn't do
