I see trees of green, red roses tooI see them bloom for me and youAnd I think to myselfWhat a wonderful worldI see skies of blue and clouds of whiteThe bright blessed day, the dark sacred nightAnd I think to myselfWhat a wonderful worldThe colors of the rainbow so pretty in the skyAre also on the faces of people going byI see friends shaking handsSaying, "How do you do?"They're really saying, "I love you"I hear babies cry, I watch them growThey'll learn much more than I'll ever knowAnd I think to myselfWhat a wonderful worldYes, I think to myselfWhat a wonderful worldOh yeah
