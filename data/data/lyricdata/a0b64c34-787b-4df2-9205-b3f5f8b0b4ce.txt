Life it seems will fade awayDrifting further every dayGetting lost within myselfNothing matters, no one elseI have lost the will to liveSimply nothing more to giveThere is nothing more for meNeed the end to set me freeThings not what they used to beMissing one inside of meDeathly loss, this can't be realCannot stand this hell I feelEmptiness is filling meTo the point of agonyGrowing darkness taking dawnI was me but now he's goneNo one but me can save myself but it's too lateNow I can't think, think why I should even tryYesterday seems as though it never existedDeath greets me warm, now I will just say goodbyeGoodbye
