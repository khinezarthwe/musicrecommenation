The first time I saw you, you were chasing down A cyclone all alone in the field With rail yards and clovers I kept rolling on Never thought you'd wind up chasing me Well, settle down I won't hesitate to hit the highway Before you lay me to waste, no Settle up And I'll help you find something to drive Before you drive me insane You're tired of walking and you loathe the ground The sidewalk will barely touch your feet And life moves too slowly to hold you down With ringing hands you take it out on me Well, settle down I won't hesitate to hit the highway Before you leave me to waste, no Settle up And I'll help you find something to drive Before you drive me insane So get yourself a car and drive it all alone Get yourself a car, ride it on the wind Get yourself a car and drive it all alone Get yourself a car and ride it on the wind Settle down I won't hesitate to hit the highway Before you lay me to waste, no Settle up And I'll help you find something to drive Before you drive me insane So get yourself a car and drive it all alone Get yourself a car, ride it on the wind Get yourself a car and drive it all alone Get yourself a car, ride it on the wind
