The first time I saw you, you were chasing downA cyclone all alone in the fieldWith rail yards and clovers I kept rolling onNever thought you'd wind up chasing meWell, settle downI won't hesitate to hit the highwayBefore you lay me to waste, noSettle upAnd I'll help you find something to driveBefore you drive me insaneYou're tired of walking and you loathe the groundThe sidewalk will barely touch your feetAnd life moves too slowly to hold you downWith ringing hands you take it out on meWell, settle downI won't hesitate to hit the highwayBefore you leave me to waste, noSettle upAnd I'll help you find something to driveBefore you drive me insaneSo get yourself a car and drive it all aloneGet yourself a car, ride it on the windGet yourself a car and drive it all aloneGet yourself a car and ride it on the windSettle downI won't hesitate to hit the highwayBefore you lay me to waste, noSettle upAnd I'll help you find something to driveBefore you drive me insaneSo get yourself a car and drive it all aloneGet yourself a car, ride it on the windGet yourself a car and drive it all aloneGet yourself a car, ride it on the wind
