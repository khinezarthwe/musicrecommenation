There's a little black spot on the sun todayIt's the same old thing as yesterdayThere's a black hat caught in a high tree topThere's a flag pole rag and the wind won't stopI have stood here before inside the pouring rainWith the world turning circles running 'round my brainI guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reignBut it's my destiny to be the king of painThere's a little black spot on the Sun todayIt's the same old thing as yesterdayThere's a black hat caught in a high tree topThere's a flag pole rag and the wind won't stopI have stood here before inside the pouring rainWith the world turning circles running 'round my brainI guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reignBut it's my destiny to be the king of painThere's a fossil that's trapped in a high cliff wallThere's a dead salmon frozen in a waterfallThere's a blue whale beached by a springtide's ebbThere's a butterfly trapped in a spider's webI have stood here before inside the pouring rainWith the world turning circles running 'round my brainI guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reignBut it's my destiny to be the king of painThere's a king on a throne with his eyes torn outThere's a blind man looking for a shadow of doubtThere's a rich man sleeping on a golden bedThere's a skeleton choking on a crust of breadKing of painThere's a red fox torn by a huntsman's packThere's a black winged gull with a broken backThere's a little black spot on the sun todayIt's the same old thing as yesterdayI have stood here before inside the pouring rainWith the world turning circles running 'round my brainI guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reignBut it's my destiny to be the king of painKing of painKing of painKing of painI'll always be king of painI'll always be king of painI'll always be king of painI'll always be king of painI'll always be king of painI'll always be king of pain
