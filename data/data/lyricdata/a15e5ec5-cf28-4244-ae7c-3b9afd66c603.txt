Bless me, Father, I have sinnedI've broken hearts, got drunk on ginAnd still I lust for sweet young thingsOn the day that I was bornBells rang out in BabylonStill I can't tell right from wrongNo matter what the Good Book saysNow I can see the sun is shiningBut I can feel the rainFalling down to wash my tears awayWash my tears awayHoly Mother, save your tearsYou've cried for me a thousand yearsBut I was blind to all your fearsNow I can't stop the tears from falling downCome the dawn of judgement dayI'll get down on my knees and praySt. Peter don't you, don't you send me awayNow I can see the sun is shiningBut I can feel the rainFalling down to wash my tears awayBless me, Father, I have sinnedI've broken hearts, got drunk on ginAnd still I lust for everythingEvery little thingCome the dawn of judgement dayI'll get down on my knees and prayThe Good Lord don't send me awayI'll never ever goNow I can see the sun is shiningBut I can feel the rainFalling down to wash my tears awayWash my tears awayI'll get down on my kneesDon't send me awayDon't you send me away, no, no, noOw, ow, owOw, ow, ow
