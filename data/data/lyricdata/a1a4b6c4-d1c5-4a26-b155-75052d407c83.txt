Something filled up my heart with nothingSomeone told me not to cryBut now that I'm older, my heart's colderAnd I can see that it's a lieChildren wake up, hold your mistake upBefore they turn the summer into dustIf the children don't grow upOur bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn upWe're just a million little gods causing rain stormsTurning every good thing to rustI guess we'll just have to adjustWith my lightning bolts a-glowingI can see where I am going to beWhen the reaper he reaches and touches my handWith my lightning bolts a-glowingI can see where I am goingWith my lightning bolts a-glowingI can see where I am goingYou better look out below
