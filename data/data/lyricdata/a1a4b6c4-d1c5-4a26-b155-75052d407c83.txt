Something filled up my heart with nothing Someone told me not to cry But now that I'm older, my heart's colder And I can see that it's a lie Children wake up, hold your mistake up Before they turn the summer into dust If the children don't grow up Our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up We're just a million little gods causing rain storms Turning every good thing to rust I guess we'll just have to adjust With my lightning bolts a-glowing I can see where I am going to be When the reaper he reaches and touches my hand With my lightning bolts a-glowing I can see where I am going With my lightning bolts a-glowing I can see where I am going You better look out below
