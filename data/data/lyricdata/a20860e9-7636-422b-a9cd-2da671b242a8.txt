Welcome to where time stands stillNo one leaves and no one willMoon is full, never seems to changeJust labelled mentally derangedDream the same thing every nightI see our freedom in my sightNo locked doors, no windows barredNo things to make my brain seem scarredSleep, my friend, and you will seeThat dream is my realityThey keep me locked up in this cageCan't they see it's why my brain says "Rage"Sanitarium, leave me beSanitarium, just leave me aloneBuild my fear of what's out thereCannot breathe the open airWhisper things into my brainAssuring me that I'm insaneThey think our heads are in their handsBut violent use brings violent plansKeep him tied, it makes him wellHe's getting better, can't you tell?No more can they keep us inListen, damn it, we will winThey see it right, they see it wellBut they think this saves us from our hellSanitarium, leave me beSanitarium, just leave me aloneSanitarium, just leave me aloneFear of living onNatives getting restless nowMutiny in the airGot some death to doMirror stares back hardKill, it's such a friendly wordSeems the only wayFor reaching out again
