If you think that a kiss is all in the lipsC'mon, you got it all wrong, manAnd if you think that our dance was all in the hipsOh well, then do the twistIf you think holding hands is all in the fingersGrab hold of the soul where the memory lingers andMake sure to never do it with a singerCause he'll tell everyone in the worldWhat he was thinking about the girlYa, but he's thinking about the girl, ohA lot of people get confused and they bruiseReal easy when it comes to loveThey start putting on their shoes and walking outAnd singing boy, I think I had enoughJust because she makes you feel wrongShe don't mean to be mean or hurt you on purpose, boyTake a tip and do yourself a little serviceTake a mountain turn it into a moleJust by playing a different roleYeah, by playing a different role, ohThe boat well you know she's rockin' itAnd the truth well ya know there's no stoppin' itThe boat ya you know she's still rockin' itAnd the truth well you know there's no stoppin' itSo what, somebody left you in a rutAnd wants to be the one who's in controlBut the feeling that you're under can really make you wonderHow the hell she can be so coldSo now you're left, denying the truthAnd it's hidden in the wisdom in the back of your toothYa need to spit it out, in a telephone boothWhile ya call everyone that you know, and ask 'emWhere do you think she goes?Oh, where do you s'pose she goes, ohAnd the truth well you know there's no stoppin' it, hey, yeahThe boat well ya know she's still rockin' itThe boat ya you know she's still rockin' itAnd the truth well you know there's no stoppin' itYou recognize the effect and the factThat it's comin' when she rocks the boatWell it's the cause hittin' on the Cardinal Laws'Bout the proper place to hang her coatSo to you, the truth is still hiddenAnd the soul plays the role of a lost little kitten butYou should know that doctors weren't kiddin'She's been singing it all alongBut you were hearin' a different songYeah you were hearin' a different songBut you were hearin' a different song
