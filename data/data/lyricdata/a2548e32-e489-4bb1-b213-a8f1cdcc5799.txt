Out of my mind Gun up to the mouth No pretension, execution Live and learn Rape and turn Fret not family Nor pre-judged army This is for me And me only Cowards only Try it Don't you try to die, like me It's livid and it's lies And makes graves descending It's not worth the time to try To replenish a rotting life I'll end the problem Facing nothing Fuck you off Fuck you all Tortured history Addict of misery This exposes me For weakness is a magnet Watch me do it( Do it, do it) Don't you try to die, like me It's livid and it's lies And makes graves descending down Why would you help anyone Who doesn't want it, doesn't need it Doesn't want your shit advice When a mind's made up To go ahead and die? What's done is done and gone So why cry? Tortured history Addict of misery This exposes me For weakness is a magnet Watch me do it( Do it, do it) Don't you try to die, like me It's livid and it's lies And makes graves descending down
