Bottle up and explode over and over Keep the troublemaker below Put it away Check out for the day In for a round of overexposure The thing mother nature provides To get up and go Bottle up and explode, seeing stars Surrounding you: red, white and blue You look at him like you've never known him But I know for a fact that you have The last time you cried Who'd you think was inside? Thinking that you were about to come over But I'm tired now of waiting for you You never show Bottle up and go, if you're gonna hide It's up to you; I'm coming through Bottle up and go, I can make it outside I'll get through; becoming you Becoming you Becoming you
