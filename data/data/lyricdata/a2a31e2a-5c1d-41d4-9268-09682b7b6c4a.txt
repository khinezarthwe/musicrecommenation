You cool your bedwarm hands downOn the broken radiatorWhen you lay them freezing on meI mumble can you wake me laterBut I don't really want you to stopAnd you know it so it doesn't stop youYou run your hands from my neckTo my chestCrack the shutters open wideI want to bathe you in the light of dayAnd just watch you as the raysTangle up around your face and bodyI could sit for hoursFinding new ways to be awed each minute'Cause the daylight seems to want youJust as much as I want youIt's been minutes it's been daysIt's been all I will rememberHappy lost in your hairAnd the cold side of the pillowYour hills and valleysAre mapped by my intrepid fingersAnd in a naked slumberI dream all this againCrack the shutters open wideI want to bathe you in the light of dayAnd just watch you as the raysTangle up around your face and bodyI could sit for hoursFinding new ways to be awed each minute'Cause the daylight seems to want youJust as much as I want you
