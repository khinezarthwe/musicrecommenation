Spearmint Rhino was taking our moneyWhen Gran was robbed of her own life honeyThe driverless hornet last post on the trumpetHis blind, crippled crumpet don't like it but lump itThe engine, it won't start without himThe engine, it won't start withoutSo I went down to Sherry's mod suits and Paul WellerAll pork pies and drainpipes to wear in all weatherAll of us shed a tear thinking of yesteryearRaise whiskey, raise beer, the old boy is not hereThe engine, it won't start without himThe engine, it won't start withoutThe engine, it won't start without himThe engine, it won't start withoutSo he's left us done up to the ninesWith satin for lining and a coating of pineAnd the engine is broke, I can't fix and I've lostAll the coals and we're running quite lowThe engine is broke, I can't fix and I've lostAll the coals and we're running quite low
