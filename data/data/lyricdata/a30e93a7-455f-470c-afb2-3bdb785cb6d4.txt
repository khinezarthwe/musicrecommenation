What became of the dreams we had? Oh, what became of forever? Oh, what became of forever? Though, we'll never know Please don't get me wrong, see, I forgive you in a song We call The Likely Lads We all bought the ones, we taught 'em all, we wrote the songs That's filled with dreams we have But blood runs thicker, oh, we're thick as thieves, you know If that's important to you, it's important to me I tried to make you see but you don't want to know You don't want to know Oh, what became of the likely lads? What became of the dreams we had? Oh, what became of forever? Oh, what became of forever?
