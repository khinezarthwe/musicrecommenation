D'you breathe the nameOf your saviour in your hour of needAnd taste the blameIf the flavor should remind you of greed,Of implication, insinuation and ill willTill you cannot lie stillIn all this turmoilBefore red cape and foilCome closing in for a killCome feed the rain'Cause I'm thirsty for your loveDancing underneath the skies of lustYeah, feed the rain'Cause without your love my lifeAin't nothing but this carnival of rustIt's all a game, avoiding failureWhen true colors will bleedAll in the name of misbehaviorAnd the things we don't needI lust for after no disaster can touchTouch us anymoreAnd more than everI hope to never fallWhere enough is not the same it was beforeCome feed the rain'Cause I'm thirsty for your loveDancing underneath the skies of lustYeah, feed the rain'Cause without your love my lifeAin't nothing but this carnival of rustYeah, feed the rain'Cause I'm thirsty for your loveDancing underneath the skies of lustYeah, feed the rain'Cause without your love my lifeAin't nothing but this carnival of rustDon't walk away, don't walk away, ohWhen the world is burningDon't walk away, don't walk away, ohWhen the heart is yearningDon't walk away, don't walk away, ohWhen the world is burningDon't walk away, don't walk away, ohWhen the heart is yearning
