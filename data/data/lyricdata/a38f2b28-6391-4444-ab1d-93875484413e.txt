I have returned to northern skiesWhere summer hasn't touchedThe clouds that pass aboveI have returned to the sombre greysOf days too early to comeAnd too hurried to stayI have left a million starsAnd an ocean light and clearly blueI have left the warmth of the sunAnd a million adventuresNot yet begunFor once there was beauty here for meUnder the wide northern skiesAnd once there was magic here for meUnder the wide northern skiesI saw trees as greenAnd this dark as blueHeartbreak and poetryWith deeper rootsBut now I knowThis is lonely countryAnd it leads me only back to the seaFor once there was beauty here for meUnder the wide northern skiesAnd once there was magic here for meUnder the wide northern skiesI have returned to northern skiesWhere summer hasn't touchedThe clouds that pass aboveI have returned to the sombre greysOf days too early to comeAnd too hurried to stayFor once there was beauty here for meUnder the wide northern skiesAnd once there was magic here for meUnder the wide northern skiesAnd once there was beauty here for meUnder the wide northern skiesAnd once there was magic here for meUnder the wide northern skies
