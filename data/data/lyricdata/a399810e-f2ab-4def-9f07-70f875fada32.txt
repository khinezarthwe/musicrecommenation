A modern day warrior, mean, mean strideToday's Tom Sawyer, mean, mean prideThough his mind is not for rentDon't put him down as arrogantHis reserve, a quiet defenseRiding out the day's eventsThe riverWhat you say about his company isWhat you say about societyCatch the mist, catch the mythCatch the mystery, catch the driftThe world is, the world isLove and life are deepMaybe as his skies are wideToday's Tom Sawyer he gets high on youAnd the space he invades, he gets by on youNo, his mind is not for rentTo any god or governmentAlways hopeful, yet discontentHe knows changes aren't permanentBut change isAnd what you say about his company isWhat you say about societyCatch the witness, catch the witCatch the spirit, catch the spitThe world is the world isLove and life are deepMaybe as his eyes are wideExit the warrior, today's Tom SawyerHe gets high on you, the energy you tradeHe gets right on to the friction of the day
