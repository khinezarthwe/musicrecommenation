I hear the train a comin', it's rollin' 'round the bendAnd I ain't seen the sunshine since, I don't know whenI'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' onBut that train keeps a rollin', on down to San AntoneWhen I was just a baby, my mama told me "Son,Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him dieWhen I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cryI bet there's rich folks eatin', in a fancy dining carThey're probably drinkin' coffee, and smokin' big cigarsWell I know I had it comin', I know I can't be freeBut those people keep a movin', and that's what tortures meWell if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mineI bet I'd move it on a little farther down the lineFar from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stayAnd I'd let that lonesome whistle, blow my blues away
