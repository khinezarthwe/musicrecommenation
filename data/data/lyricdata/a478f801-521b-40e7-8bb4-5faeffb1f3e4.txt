Come up to meet youTell you I'm sorryYou don't know how lovely you areI had to find youTell you I need youTell you I set you apartTell me your secretsAnd ask me your questionsOh let's go back to the startRunning in circlesComing up tailsHeads on a science apartNobody said it was easyIt's such a shame for us to partNobody said it was easyNo one ever said it would be this hardOh take me back to the startI was just guessingAt numbers and figuresPulling your puzzles apartQuestions of scienceScience and progressCould not speak as loud as my heartTell me you love meCome back and haunt meOh when I rush to the startRunning in circlesChasing tailsComing back as we areNobody said it was easyOh it's such a shame for us to partNobody said it was easyNo one ever said it would be so hardI'm going back to the start.
