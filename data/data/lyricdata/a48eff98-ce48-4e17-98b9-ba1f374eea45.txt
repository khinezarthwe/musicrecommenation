I've waited hours for thisI've made myself so sickI wish I'd stayed asleep todayI never thought this day would endI never thought tonight could ever beThis close to meJust try to see in the darkJust try to make it workTo feel the fear before you're hereI make the shapes come much too closeI pull my eyes out, hold my breath and waitUntil I shakeBut if I had your faithThen I could make it safe and cleanIf only I was sureThat my head on the door was a dreamI've waited hours for thisI've made myself so sickI wish I'd stayed asleep todayI never thought this day would endI never thought tonight could ever beThis close to meBut if I had your faceThen I could make it safe and cleanOh, if only I was sureThat my head on the door was a dream
