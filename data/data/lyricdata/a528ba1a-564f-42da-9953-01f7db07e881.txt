Stay away from meBuild a fortressAnd shield your beliefsTouch the divineAs we fall in lineCan I believeWhen I don't trustAll your theoriesTurn to dustI choose to hideFrom the all seeing eyeDestroy this city of delusionAnd break these walls downAnd I will avengeAnd justify my reasons with your bloodYou'll not restSettle for lessUntil you guzzleAnd squander what's leftDo not denyYet you live and let dieDestroy this city of delusionAnd break these walls downAnd I will avengeAnd justify my reasons with your bloodDestroy this city of delusionAnd break these walls downAnd I will avengeAnd justify my reasons with your blood
