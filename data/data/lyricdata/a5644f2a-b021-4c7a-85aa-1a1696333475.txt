I lost my leg like I lost my waySo no loose endsNothing to see me downHow are we going to work this outDreams aren't bad, I had turned backI love the girlBut God only knows it'sGetting hard to see the sun coming throughI love you...But what are we going to do?Picture on the dreamerI'll take you deeperDown to the sleepy glowTime is a low...Don't you knowWhat are we going to do?When you go backAll the second selfless daysYou're in love with himI want to see you againI love you...But what are we going to do?
