Love of mineSomeday you will dieBut I'll be close behindI'll follow you into the darkNo blinding lightOr tunnels to gates of whiteJust our hands clasped so tightWaiting for the hint of the sparkIf Heaven and Hell decideThat they both are satisfiedIlluminate the "No"s on their vacancy signsIf there's no one beside youWhen your soul embarksThen I'll follow you into the darkAnd Catholic schoolAs vicious as Roman ruleI got my knuckles bruisedBy a lady in blackAnd I held my tongueAs she told me "Son,Fear is the heart of love"So I never went backIf Heaven and Hell decideThat they both are satisfiedIlluminate the "No"s on their vacancy signsIf there's no one beside youWhen your soul embarksThen I'll follow you into the darkYou and meHave seen everything to seeFrom Bangkok to CalgaryAnd the soles of your shoesAre all worn downThe time for sleep is nowIt's nothing to cry about'Cause we'll hold each other soonIn the blackest of roomsIf Heaven and Hell decideThat they both are satisfiedIlluminate the "No"s on their vacancy signsIf there's no one beside youWhen your soul embarksThen I'll follow you into the darkAnd I'll follow you into the dark
