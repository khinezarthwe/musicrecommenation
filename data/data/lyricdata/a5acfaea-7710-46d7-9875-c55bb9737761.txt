Let's get out of this countryI'll admit I am bored with meI drowned my sorrows and slept aroundWhen not in body at least in mindWe'll find a cathedral city, you can convince me I am prettyWe'll pick berries and reclineLet's hit the road dear friend of mineWave goodbye to our thankless jobsWe'll drive for miles maybe never turn offWe'll find a cathedral city you can be handsome I'll be prettyWhat does this city have to offer me?Everyone else thinks it's the bee's kneesWhat does this city have to offer me?I just can't see, I just can't seeLet's get out of this countryI have been so unhappySmell the Jasmine my head was turnedI feel like getting confessionalWe'll find a cathedral city, you can convince me I am prettyWhat does this city have to offer me?Everyone else thinks it's the bee's kneesWhat does this city have to offer me?I just can't see, I just can't see
