I saw a saviour, a saviour come my way I thought I'd see it in the cold light of day But now I realize that I'm only for me If only I could see, return myself to me And recognize the poison in my heart There is no other place, no one else I face The remedy will agree with how I feel Here in my reflecting, what more can I say? For I am guilty for the voice that I obey Too scared to sacrifice the choice chosen for me If only I could see, return myself to me And recognize the poison in my heart There is no other place, no one else I face The remedy to agree with how I feel
