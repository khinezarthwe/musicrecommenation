I saw a saviour, a saviour come my wayI thought I'd see it in the cold light of dayBut now I realize that I'm only for meIf only I could see, return myself to meAnd recognize the poison in my heartThere is no other place, no one else I faceThe remedy will agree with how I feelHere in my reflecting, what more can I say?For I am guilty for the voice that I obeyToo scared to sacrifice the choice chosen for meIf only I could see, return myself to meAnd recognize the poison in my heartThere is no other place, no one else I faceThe remedy to agree with how I feel
