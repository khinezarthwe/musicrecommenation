So you no longer care if there's another dayI guess I have been there, I guess I am there nowYou knew what you wanted and you fought so hardJust to find yourself sitting in a golden cageIn a golden cageSo of course I miss you and miss you badBut I also felt this way when I was still with youYes of course I miss you and miss you badBut I also felt this way when I was still with youThis city's no longer mineThere's sadness written on every cornerEach lover was made to signNow I hear them calling me over and over
