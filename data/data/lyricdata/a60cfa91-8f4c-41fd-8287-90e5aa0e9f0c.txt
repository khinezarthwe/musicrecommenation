In the wintertime keep your feet warm But keep your clothes on and don't forget me Keep your memories But keep your powder dry too In the summer by the poolside While the fireflies are all around you I'll miss you when I'm lonely I'll miss the alimony too Don't forget me, don't forget me Make it easy only just for a little while You know I think about you Let me know you think about me too And when we're older and full of cancer It doesn't matter now, come on get happy' Cause nothing lasts forever But I will always love you Don't forget me, please don't forget me Make it easy only just for a little while You know I think about you Let me know you think about me too
