In the wintertime keep your feet warmBut keep your clothes on and don't forget meKeep your memoriesBut keep your powder dry tooIn the summer by the poolsideWhile the fireflies are all around youI'll miss you when I'm lonelyI'll miss the alimony tooDon't forget me, don't forget meMake it easy only just for a little whileYou know I think about youLet me know you think about me tooAnd when we're older and full of cancerIt doesn't matter now, come on get happy'Cause nothing lasts foreverBut I will always love youDon't forget me, please don't forget meMake it easy only just for a little whileYou know I think about youLet me know you think about me too
