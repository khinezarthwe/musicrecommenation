When I grow upI want to be a foresterRun through the moss on high heelsThat's what I'll doThrowing out a boomerangWaiting for it to come back to meWhen I grow upI want to live near the seaCrab claws and bottles of rumThat's what I'll haveStaring at the seashellWaiting for it to embrace meI put my soul in what I doLast night I drew a funny manWith dog eyes and a hanging tongueIt goes way badI never like that sad lookFrom someone who wants to be loved by youI'm very good with plantsWhen my friends are awayThey let me keep the soil moistOn the seventh day I restFor a minute or twoThen back on my feet to call for youYou've got cucumbers on your eyesToo much time spent on nothingWaiting for a moment to ariseThe face in the ceilingAnd arms too longI'm waiting for him to catch meWaiting for it to embrace me oh
