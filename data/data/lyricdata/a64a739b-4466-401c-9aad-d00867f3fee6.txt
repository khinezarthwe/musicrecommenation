When you're falling awakeAnd you take stock of the new dayAnd you hear your voice croakAs you choke on what you need to sayWell, don't you fret, don't you fearI will give you good cheerLife's a long songLife's a long songLife's a long songIf you wait then your plate I will fillAs the verses unfoldAnd your soul suffers the long dayAnd the twelve o'clock gloom, spins the roomYou struggle on your wayWell, don't you sigh, don't you cryLick the dust from your eyeLife's a long songLife's a long songLife's a long songWe will meet in the sweet light of dawnAs the Baker Street train spills your painAll over your new dressAnd the symphony sounds undergroundPut you under duressWell, don't you squeal as the heelGrinds you under the wheelsLife's a long songLife's a long songLife's a long songBut the tune ends too soon for us allBut the tune ends too soon for us all
