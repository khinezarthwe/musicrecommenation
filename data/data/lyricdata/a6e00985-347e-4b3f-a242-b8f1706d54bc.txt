You can't escape the wrath of my heartBeating to your funeral songAll faith is lust for hell regainedAnd love dust in the hands of shameLet me bleed you this song of my heart deformedLead you along this path in the darkWhere I belong until I feel your warmthHold me like you held on to lifeWhen all fears came alive and entombed meLove me like you loved the sunScorching the blood in my vampire heartI'll be the thorns in every rose,You've been sent by hope(You'll grow cold)I am the nightmare waking you upFrom the dream of a dream of love(Just like before)Let me weep you this poem as heaven's gates closePaint you my soul scarred and aloneWaiting for your kiss to take me back homeHold me like you held on to lifeWhen all fears came alive and entombed meLove me like you loved the sunScorching the blood in my vampire heartHold me like you held onto life(Like you held onto life)(When all fears came alive and entombed me)My vampire heartLove me like you loved the sun(Love me like you loved the sun)(Scorching the blood in my)My vampire heart
