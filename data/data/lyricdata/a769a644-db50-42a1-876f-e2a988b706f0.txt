Sing, Michael, sing On the route of the 19 bus We hear them saying How you get a rude and a reckless? Don't you be so crude and a feckless You've been drinking brew for breakfast Rudie can't fail (no, no) We reply, I know that my life makes you nervous But I tell you that I can't live in service Like the doctor who was born for a purpose Rudie can't fail (okay) I went to the market to realize my soul' Cause what I need I just don't have (oh no) First they curse, then they press me 'til I hurt( We say) Rudie can't fail First you must cure your temper Then you find a job in the paper You need someone for a savior Rudie can't fail We reply, Now we get a rude and a reckless We been seen looking cool and speckless We been drinking brew for breakfast Rudie can't fail (no no no) I went to the market to realize my soul' Cause what I need I just don't have First they curse, then they press me 'til I hurt Rudie can't fail So where you wanna go today? Hey boss man! So you think you're pretty smart( In the chicken skin suit) With your chicken skin suit You think you're pretty hot( Pork pie hat) With the pork pie hat Rudie can't fail Rudie can't fail
