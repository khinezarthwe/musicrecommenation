Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenueThought I heard you talking softlyI turned on the lights, the TV and the radioStill, I can't escape the ghost of youWhat has happened to it all?Crazy, some'll sayWhere is the life that I recognize?Gone awayBut I won't cry for yesterdayThere's an ordinary worldSomehow I have to findAnd as I try to make my wayTo the ordinary worldI will learn to survivePassion or coincidence once prompted you to say"Pride will tear us both apart"Well, now, pride's gone out the window 'cross the rooftops, run awayLeft me in the vacuum of my heartWhat is happening to me?Crazy, some'll sayWhere is my friend when I need you most?Gone awayBut I won't cry for yesterdayThere's an ordinary worldSomehow I have to findAnd as I try to make my wayTo the ordinary worldI will learn to survivePapers in the roadside tell of suffering and greedFear today, forgot tomorrowOoh, here beside the news of holy war and holy needOurs is just a little sorrowed talk(Just blown away)And I don't cry for yesterdayThere's an ordinary worldSomehow I have to findAnd as I try to make my wayTo the ordinary worldI will learn to surviveEvery world is my world (I will learn to survive)Any world is my world (I will learn to survive)Any world is my world
