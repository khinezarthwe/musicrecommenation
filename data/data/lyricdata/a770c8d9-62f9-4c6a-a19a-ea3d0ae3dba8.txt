Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue Thought I heard you talking softly I turned on the lights, the T V and the radio Still, I can't escape the ghost of you What has happened to it all? Crazy, some'll say Where is the life that I recognize? Gone away But I won't cry for yesterday There's an ordinary world Somehow I have to find And as I try to make my way To the ordinary world I will learn to survive Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say" Pride will tear us both apart" Well, now, pride's gone out the window 'cross the rooftops, run away Left me in the vacuum of my heart What is happening to me? Crazy, some'll say Where is my friend when I need you most? Gone away But I won't cry for yesterday There's an ordinary world Somehow I have to find And as I try to make my way To the ordinary world I will learn to survive Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed Fear today, forgot tomorrow Ooh, here beside the news of holy war and holy need Ours is just a little sorrowed talk( Just blown away) And I don't cry for yesterday There's an ordinary world Somehow I have to find And as I try to make my way To the ordinary world I will learn to survive Every world is my world ( I will learn to survive) Any world is my world ( I will learn to survive) Any world is my world
