Spend all your time waitingFor that second chanceFor a break that would make it okayThere's always some reasonTo feel not good enoughAnd it's hard at the end of the dayI need some distractionOh beautiful releaseMemory seeps from my veinsLet me be emptyAnd weightless and maybeI'll find some peace tonightIn the arms of an angelFly away from hereFrom this dark cold hotel roomAnd the endlessness that you fearYou are pulled from the wreckageOf your silent reverieYou're in the arms of the angelMay you find some comfort hereSo tired of the straight lineAnd everywhere you turnThere's vultures and thieves at your backAnd the storm keeps on twistingYou keep on building the lieThat you make up for all that you lackIt don't make no differenceEscaping one last timeIt's easier to believe in this sweet madnessOh this glorious sadness that brings me to my kneesIn the arms of an angelFly away from hereFrom this dark cold hotel roomAnd the endlessness that you fearYou are pulled from the wreckageOf your silent reverieYou're in the arms of the angelMay you find some comfort hereYou're in the arms of the angelMay you find some comfort here
