As she walks in the room, scented and tallHesitating once moreAnd as I take on myself and the bitterness I feltRealize that love flowsWild white horses, they will take me awayAnd the tenderness I feel will send the dark underneathWill I follow?Through the glory of life, I will scatter on the floorDisappointed and soreAnd in my thoughts I have bled for the riddles I've been fedAnother line moves overWild white horses, they will take me awayAnd the tenderness I feel will send the dark underneathWill I follow?Wild white horses, they will take me awayAnd the tenderness I feel will send the dark underneathWill I follow?
