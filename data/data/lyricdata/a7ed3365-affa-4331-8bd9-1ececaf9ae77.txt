As she walks in the room, scented and tall Hesitating once more And as I take on myself and the bitterness I felt Realize that love flows Wild white horses, they will take me away And the tenderness I feel will send the dark underneath Will I follow? Through the glory of life, I will scatter on the floor Disappointed and sore And in my thoughts I have bled for the riddles I've been fed Another line moves over Wild white horses, they will take me away And the tenderness I feel will send the dark underneath Will I follow? Wild white horses, they will take me away And the tenderness I feel will send the dark underneath Will I follow?
