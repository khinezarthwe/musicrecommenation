You said "send me stationery to make me horny"So I always write you letters in multicoloursDecorating envelopes for foreplayDamn extended metaphors, I get carried awayOn the back of a natural disaster, fixed with parcel tape and with kids sticking plasterNothing says "I miss you" quite like war poetry you carved in your door with a Stanley knifeMy year in listsStomping on your fingers as you're clinging on to the abyssSo put on every winter coat that you owned since '98And every midnight sees the countdown to another awful dayI cherish with fondness the day (before) I met youI cherish with fondness the day (before) I met youI cherish with fondness the day before I met youOn your request, I compile a listOf my top five resolutions for this year (one!)I declined 'cause I decided that I (two!)Do not believe in the New Year any more (three!)And you must confess that at times like theseHopefulness is tantamount to hopelessness (four!)And I accept that it's time for a change but not in places like this with people like these (five! five! five! five! five!)My year in listsStomping on your fingers as you're clinging on to the abyssSo put on every winter coat that you owned since '98And every midnight sees the countdown to another awful dayI cherish with fondness the day (before) I met youI cherish with fondness the day (before) I met youI cherish with fondness the day before I met you.
