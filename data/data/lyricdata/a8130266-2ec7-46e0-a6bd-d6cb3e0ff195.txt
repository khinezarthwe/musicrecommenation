Time has told me you're a rare, rare findA troubled cure for a troubled mindAnd time has told me not to ask for moreSomeday our ocean will find its shoreSo I'll leave the ways that are making me beWhat I really don't want to beLeave the ways that are making me loveWhat I really don't want to loveTime has told me you came with the dawnA soul with no footprint, a rose with no thornYour tears they tell me there's really no wayOf ending your troubles with things you can sayAnd time will tell you to stay by my sideTo keep on trying 'til there's no more to hideSo leave the ways that are making you beWhat you really don't want to beLeave the ways that are making you loveWhat you really don't want to loveTime has told me you're a rare, rare findA troubled cure for a troubled mindAnd time has told me not to ask for moreFor some day our ocean will find its shore
