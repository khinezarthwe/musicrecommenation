Time has told me you're a rare, rare find A troubled cure for a troubled mind And time has told me not to ask for more Someday our ocean will find its shore So I'll leave the ways that are making me be What I really don't want to be Leave the ways that are making me love What I really don't want to love Time has told me you came with the dawn A soul with no footprint, a rose with no thorn Your tears they tell me there's really no way Of ending your troubles with things you can say And time will tell you to stay by my side To keep on trying 'til there's no more to hide So leave the ways that are making you be What you really don't want to be Leave the ways that are making you love What you really don't want to love Time has told me you're a rare, rare find A troubled cure for a troubled mind And time has told me not to ask for more For some day our ocean will find its shore
