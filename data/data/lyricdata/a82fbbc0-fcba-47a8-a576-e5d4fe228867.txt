StrangeThought I knew you wellThought I had read the skyThought I had read a change in your eyesSo strangeWoke up to a worldThat I am not a partExcept when I can play it's strangerAfter all, what were you really looking for?And I wonder when will I learn, when will I learn?Blue isn't red, everybody knows thisAnd I wonder when will I learn, when will I learn?Guess I was in deeper than I thought I wasIf I have enough love for the both of usJust stayYou said we'll build a nestSo I left my lifeTried on your friends, tried on your opinionsSo whenThe bridges froze and youDid not come homeI put a snowflake under a microscopeAfter all, what was I really looking for?And I wonder when will I learn, when will I learn?Maybe my wish knew better than I didAnd I wonder when will I learn, when will I learn?Guess I was in deeper than I thought I wasIf I have enough love for the both of usSo strangeNow I'm finally inThe party has begunIt's not like I can feel you stillBut strangeWhat I will leave behindYou call me one more timeBut now I must be leaving
