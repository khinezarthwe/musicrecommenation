Women like you Know what to say You know when to move And know when you shouldn't stay Women like you Are never alonebut never too fastand careful 'cause you say so That's what your face shows Women like you Don't need to hear itor whisper through the door' Cause you know what your heart's for Know what your heart's for Blind men like mecan never hold on( Then it's gone) Blind men like me Don't know how to behave(at all) Whatever you choose The broken voice that I'll assume Just creep to a crawl And kiss me under each new moon
