I'll find a wayto see you againI'll find a wayto see you againI used to think that anything I'd dowouldn't matter at all anywayBut now I find that when it comes to youI'm the winner of cards I can't playWait for mewait for meDarlingI need you desperatelydesperately hereAnd I'll find a wayto see you againI'll find a wayto see you againThe rain is like an orchestra to meLittle gifts from above meant to sayGirl, you're falling at his feetIsn't lovely or stunning todayLay with melay with meI'm alive when you're here with mehere with mestayAnd I'll find a wayto see you againYes I'll find a wayto see you againWhy do the street lamps dieWhen you're passing byLike a hand that won't stay on my shoulder tonight?If you held me close, would you laugh it away?Would you dare the glance that I steal to stay?And I'll find a wayto see you againYes I'll find a wayto see you againI'll find a wayto see you again...
