I'll find a wayto see you again I'll find a wayto see you again I used to think that anything I'd dowouldn't matter at all anyway But now I find that when it comes to you I'm the winner of cards I can't play Wait for mewait for me Darling I need you desperatelydesperately here And I'll find a wayto see you again I'll find a wayto see you again The rain is like an orchestra to me Little gifts from above meant to say Girl, you're falling at his feet Isn't lovely or stunning today Lay with melay with me I'm alive when you're here with mehere with mestay And I'll find a wayto see you again Yes I'll find a wayto see you again Why do the street lamps die When you're passing by Like a hand that won't stay on my shoulder tonight? If you held me close, would you laugh it away? Would you dare the glance that I steal to stay? And I'll find a wayto see you again Yes I'll find a wayto see you again I'll find a wayto see you again... (x4) The rain'll bringme down.(x3)
