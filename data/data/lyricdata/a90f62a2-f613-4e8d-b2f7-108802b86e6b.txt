Lover, when you don't lay with meI'm a huntress for a husband lost at seaIf I had you hereBraid our hair togetherI'd be boy and you'd be girlBeautifulCalling moon and moonShoot that big bad handIt'll drag me to your doorAnd I won't see you no moreWhen this wild world (wild world)Is a big bad hand (big bad hand)Pushing on my back (my back)Do you understand? (understand)When I get home (get home)Been in the jungle (jungle)Whereâ€™s my bear to lick me clean? (lick clean)Feed my soul milk and honeyCalling moon and moonShoot that big bad handIt'll drag me to your doorAnd I won't see you no moreI won't see you no more
