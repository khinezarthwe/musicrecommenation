The Litebrite's now black-and-white'Cause they took apart a picture that wasn't rightPitch burning on a shining sheetThe only maker that you'd want to meetA dying man in a living roomWhose shadow paces the floorHe'll take you out any open doorThis is not my lifeIt's just a fond farewell to a friendIt's not what I'm likeIt's just a fond farewell to a friendWho couldn't get things rightFond farewell to a friendHe said "really, I just wanna dance"Good and evil matched perfect, it's a great romanceI can deal with some psychic painIf it'll slow down my higher brainVeins full of disappearing inkVomiting in the kitchen sinkDisconnecting from the missing linkThis is not my lifeIt's just a fond farewell to a friendIt's not what I'm likeIt's just a fond farewell to a friendWho couldn't get things rightFond farewell to a friendI see you're leaving me and taking up with the enemyThe cold comfort of the in-betweenA little less than a human beingA little less than a happy highA little less than a suicideThe only things that you really triedThis is not my lifeIt's just a fond farewell to a friendIt's not what I'm likeIt's just a fond farewell to a friendWho couldn't get things rightFond farewell to a friendThis is not my lifeIt's just a fond farewell to a friendOoh, oohOoh, oohOoh, oohOoh
