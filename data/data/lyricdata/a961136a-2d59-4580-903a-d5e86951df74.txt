The Litebrite's now black-and-white' Cause they took apart a picture that wasn't right Pitch burning on a shining sheet The only maker that you'd want to meet A dying man in a living room Whose shadow paces the floor He'll take you out any open door This is not my life It's just a fond farewell to a friend It's not what I'm like It's just a fond farewell to a friend Who couldn't get things right Fond farewell to a friend He said "really, I just wanna dance" Good and evil matched perfect, it's a great romance I can deal with some psychic pain If it'll slow down my higher brain Veins full of disappearing ink Vomiting in the kitchen sink Disconnecting from the missing link This is not my life It's just a fond farewell to a friend It's not what I'm like It's just a fond farewell to a friend Who couldn't get things right Fond farewell to a friend I see you're leaving me and taking up with the enemy The cold comfort of the in-between A little less than a human being A little less than a happy high A little less than a suicide The only things that you really tried This is not my life It's just a fond farewell to a friend It's not what I'm like It's just a fond farewell to a friend Who couldn't get things right Fond farewell to a friend This is not my life It's just a fond farewell to a friend Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Ooh
