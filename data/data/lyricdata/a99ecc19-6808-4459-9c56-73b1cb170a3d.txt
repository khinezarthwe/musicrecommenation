When she's on her best behaviourDon't be tempted by her favoursNever turn your back on mother earthTowns are hurled from A to BBy hands that look so smooth to meNever turn your back on mother earthGrasp at straws that don't want graspingGaze at clouds that come down crashingNever turn your back on mother earthThree days and two nights away from my friendsAmen to anything that brings quick return to my friendsTo my friendsI'll admit I was unfaithfulFrom now I'll be more faithfulNever turn your back on motherNever turn your back on motherNever turn your back on mother earth
