So today I wrote a song for youCause a day can get so longAnd I know it's hard to make it throughWhen you say there's something wrongSo I'm trying to put it rightCause I want to love you with my heartAll this trying has made me tiredAnd I don't know even where to startMaybe that's a startFor you know it's a simple gameThat you play filling up your head with rainAnd you know you've been hiding from your painIn the way, in the way you say your nameAnd I see youHiding your face in your handsFlying so you won't landYou think no one understandsNo one understandsSo you hunch your shoulders and you shake your headAnd your throat is aching but you swearNo one hurts you, nothing could be sadAnyway you're not here enough to careAnd you're so tired you don't sleep at nightAs your heart is trying to mendYou keep it quiet but you think you mightDisappear before the endAnd it's strange how you cannot findAny strength to even tryTo find a voice to speak your mindWhen you do, all you wanna do is cryWell maybe you should cryAnd I see you hiding your face in your handsTalking 'bout far-away landsYou think no one understandsListen to my handsAnd all of this lifeMoves around youFor all that you claimYou're standing stillYou are moving tooYou are moving tooYou are moving tooI will move with you
