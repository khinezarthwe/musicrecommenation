And when I see you, I really see you upside down But my brain knows better, it picks you up and turns you around Turns you around Turns you around If you feel discouraged when there's a lack of color here Please don't worry lover, it's really bursting at the seams From absorbing everything The spectrum's A to Z This is fact not fiction for the first time in years And all the girls in every girlie magazine can't make me feel any less alone I'm reaching for the phone To call at 7:03 And on your machine I slur a plea for you to come home But I know it's too late And I should have given you a reason to stay Given you a reason to stay Given you a reason to stay Given you a reason to stay This is fact not fiction for the first time in years
