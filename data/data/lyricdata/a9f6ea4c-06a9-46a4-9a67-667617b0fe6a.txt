And when I see you, I really see you upside downBut my brain knows better, it picks you up and turns you aroundTurns you aroundTurns you aroundIf you feel discouraged when there's a lack of color herePlease don't worry lover, it's really bursting at the seamsFrom absorbing everythingThe spectrum's A to ZThis is fact not fiction for the first time in yearsAnd all the girls in every girlie magazine can't make me feel any less aloneI'm reaching for the phoneTo call at 7:03And on your machine I slur a plea for you to come homeBut I know it's too lateAnd I should have given you a reason to stayGiven you a reason to stayGiven you a reason to stayGiven you a reason to stayThis is fact not fiction for the first time in years
