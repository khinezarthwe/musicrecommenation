Everybody's looking at me Feeling paranoid inside When I step outside, I feel free Think I'll find a place to hide Tell me people, am I going insane? Insane? Tell me people, am I going insane? Insane? Every day I sit and wonder How my life, it used to be Now I feel like going under Now my life is hard to see So tell me people, am I going insane? Insane? Tell me people, am I going insane? Insane? So I'm telling all you people Listen while I sing again If I don't sound very cheerful I think that I'm a schizo brain So tell me people, am I going insane? Insane? Tell me people, am I going insane? Insane? Tell me people, am I going insane? Insane? Tell me people, am I going insane? Insane?
