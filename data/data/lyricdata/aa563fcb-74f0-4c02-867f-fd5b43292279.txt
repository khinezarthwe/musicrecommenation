Look in the mirror and tell meJust what you seeWhat have the years of your lifeTaught you to beInnocence dyin' in so many waysThings that you dream of are lostLost in the hazeHold on, baby, hold on'Cause it's closer than you thinkAnd you're standing on the brinkHold on, baby, hold on'Cause there's something on the wayYour tomorrow's not the same as todayDon't you recall what you feltWhen you weren't aloneSomeone who stood by your sideA face you have knownWhere do you run when it's too much to bearWho do you turn to in needWhen nobody's thereOutside your door He is waitingWaiting for youSooner or later you knowHe's got to get throughNo hesitation and no holding backLet it all go and you'll knowYou're on the right trackHold on, baby, hold on'Cause it's closer than you thinkAnd you're standing on the brinkHold on, baby, hold on'Cause there's something on the wayYour tomorrow's not the same as today
