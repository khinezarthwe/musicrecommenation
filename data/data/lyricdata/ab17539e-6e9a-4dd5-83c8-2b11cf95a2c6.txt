I wanna go to bed with arms around meBut wake up on my ownPretend that I'm still sleepingTil' you go homeOh I can't look at you this morningI should probably have a signThat says â€˜Leave right now or quicker'You've overstayed your timeIf I don't believe in love nothing will last for meIf I don't believe in love nothing is safe for meWhen I don't believe in love you're too close to meAnd that's why you have to leaveMaybe I slept peaceful on your shoulderYour arm warm around my sideBut it's different now, it's morningAnd I can't face your smileThe second that I feel your safe handsReaching out for mineI slip away and out of sightYou've overstayed your timeIf I don't believe in love nothing is good for meIf I don't believe in love nothing will last for meWhen I don't believe in love nothing is new for meNothing is wrong for meAnd nothing is real for meWhen I don't believe in love why do you care for me?When I don't believe in love nothing is real for meIf I don't believe in love you're getting to close to meAnd that's why you have to leaveAnd that's why you have to leaveIf I don't believe in loveIf I don't believe in loveIf I don't believe in loveNothing is left for meIf I don't believe in loveYou're too good for me
