I wanna go to bed with arms around me But wake up on my own Pretend that I'm still sleeping Til' you go home Oh I can't look at you this morning I should probably have a sign That says â€˜ Leave right now or quicker' You've overstayed your time If I don't believe in love nothing will last for me If I don't believe in love nothing is safe for me When I don't believe in love you're too close to me And that's why you have to leave Maybe I slept peaceful on your shoulder Your arm warm around my side But it's different now, it's morning And I can't face your smile The second that I feel your safe hands Reaching out for mine I slip away and out of sight You've overstayed your time If I don't believe in love nothing is good for me If I don't believe in love nothing will last for me When I don't believe in love nothing is new for me Nothing is wrong for me And nothing is real for me When I don't believe in love why do you care for me? When I don't believe in love nothing is real for me If I don't believe in love you're getting to close to me And that's why you have to leave And that's why you have to leave If I don't believe in love If I don't believe in love If I don't believe in love Nothing is left for me If I don't believe in love You're too good for me
