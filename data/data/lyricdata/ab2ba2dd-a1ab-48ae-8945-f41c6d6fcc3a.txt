Walking down the Mercer StBeen a long hot summerRain like daggers coming down on meGet a feeling it's too lateBut alone, togetherCould be we might start it up all over againDream, realYou're not too lateSweet road to somewhere else3'o clock I'm on my wayOn the road to somewhereLittle clouds like wounds that blow awayListening to the radioLike a friend that guides mePlaying out every songWe used to knowDream, realYou're not too lateSweet road to somewhere elseBring it onCome alongOn the road to somewhereTake our timeSee the signsOn the road to somewhere
