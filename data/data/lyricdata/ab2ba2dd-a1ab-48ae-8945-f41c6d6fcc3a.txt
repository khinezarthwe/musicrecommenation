Walking down the Mercer St Been a long hot summer Rain like daggers coming down on me Get a feeling it's too late But alone, together Could be we might start it up all over again Dream, real You're not too late Sweet road to somewhere else3'o clock I'm on my way On the road to somewhere Little clouds like wounds that blow away Listening to the radio Like a friend that guides me Playing out every song We used to know Dream, real You're not too late Sweet road to somewhere else Bring it on Come along On the road to somewhere Take our time See the signs On the road to somewhere
