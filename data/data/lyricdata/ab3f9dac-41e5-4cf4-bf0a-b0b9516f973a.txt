Lips are turning blueA kiss that can't renewI only dream of youMy beautifulTiptoe to your roomA starlight in the gloomI only dream of youAnd you never knewSing for absolutionI will be singingAnd falling from your graceThere's no where left to hideIn no one to confideThe truth burns deep insideAnd will never dieLips are turning blueA kiss that can't renewI only dream of youMy beautifulSing for absolutionI will be singingAnd falling from your graceSing for absolutionI will be singingAnd falling from your graceOur wrongs remain unrectifiedAnd our soulsWon't be exhumed
