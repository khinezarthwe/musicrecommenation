Sometime after midnight, the heat begins to riseGirl you'd shame the devil with the look that's in your eyesI know what's on your mind and I can't run awayIf I don't give you what you want there's going to be some hell to payCreeping up behind me, knocking at my doorI'd never be too blind to see just what you're looking forYou roll me over, make me moanOoh such a velvet touch, you'd melt a heart of stoneAny time, any placeI'm just the fool who puts a smile on your faceA slave to love and keep you youngAll it takes and no mistakes is just a slip of the tongueAnd if I want a little love I got to take a little painMake me think a thousand times before I kiss againI'm waiting on your, every day and every nightIf I don't try to satisfy there's going to be a fist fightAny time, any placeI'm just the fool who puts a smile on your faceA slave to love and keep you youngAll it takes and no mistakes is just a slip of the tongueThe sun is slowly rising and I'm sinking to my kneesI'm dying just to close my eyes, I'm begging, darling, pleaseI hear you calling and I'm crawling cross the floorI give you everything I got and still you ask for moreAny time, any placeI'm just the fool who puts a smile on your faceA slave to love and keep you youngAll it takes and no mistakes is just a slip of the tongue
