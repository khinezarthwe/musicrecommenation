I hurt myself today to see if I still feel I focus on my pain, the only thing that's real The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting Try to kill it all away but I remember everything What have I become? My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away in the end You could have it all, my empire of dirt I will let you down, I will make you hurt I wear this crown of shit upon my liar's chair Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time, the feelings disappear You are someone else, I am still right here What have I become? My sweetest friend Everyone I know goes away in the end And you could have it all, my empire of dirt I will let you down, I will make you hurt If I could start again a million miles away I would keep myself, I would find a way
