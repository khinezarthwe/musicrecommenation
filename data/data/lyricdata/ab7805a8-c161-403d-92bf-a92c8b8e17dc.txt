I hurt myself today to see if I still feelI focus on my pain, the only thing that's realThe needle tears a hole, the old familiar stingTry to kill it all away but I remember everythingWhat have I become? My sweetest friendEveryone I know goes away in the endYou could have it all, my empire of dirtI will let you down, I will make you hurtI wear this crown of shit upon my liar's chairFull of broken thoughts I cannot repairBeneath the stains of time, the feelings disappearYou are someone else, I am still right hereWhat have I become? My sweetest friendEveryone I know goes away in the endAnd you could have it all, my empire of dirtI will let you down, I will make you hurtIf I could start again a million miles awayI would keep myself, I would find a way
