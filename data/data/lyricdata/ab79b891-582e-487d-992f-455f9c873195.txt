Nothing left to sayAnd all I've left to do is run away from youAnd she led me on, down with secrets I can't keepClose your eyes and sleepDon't wait up for meHush now don't you speak to meWrap my hurt in youAnd took my shelter in that painThe opiate of blame is your broken heart, heart, your heartSo now I'm all by myselfAs I've always feltAnd I'll betray my tears to anyone caught in our ruse of foolsOne last kiss for me, yeahOne last kiss goodnightDidn't want to lose you once againDidn't want to be your friendFulfill a promise made of tinAnd crawled back to youI'm all by myselfAs I've always feltAnd I'll betray myselfTo anyone, lost, anyone but youSo let the sadness come againOn that you can depend on me, yeahUntil the bitter, bitter end of the world, yeahWhen God sleeps in blissI'm all by myselfAs I've always feltAnd I'll betray myself to anyone...
