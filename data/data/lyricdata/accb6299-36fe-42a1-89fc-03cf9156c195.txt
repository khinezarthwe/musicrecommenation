Oh, like many a male,I get angst in my pantsAnd goddamn it to hell,It don't help if I danceAnd you, you're not doing too wellAll the blogs are about you, girlThey caught you in the park after darkGiving head to a statue, girlOh, cruel!You're on your honeymoonAnd you're sending me notesYou hope to see me soon,You've got "see" wrapped in quotesI used to find it funny to say,"What's your man got to do with me?"But then I saw him downtown,Placing bets on the houndsHe was as big as a house!We can't be messin' around!Oooh, every time we kiss,It's like an inside jokeI always miss.Our love is like a tug-of-warDon't touch me girl,I can't hug no more!Every time we kiss,It's like an inside jokeI always miss.Our love is like a tug-of-warDon't touch me girl,I can't hug no more!
