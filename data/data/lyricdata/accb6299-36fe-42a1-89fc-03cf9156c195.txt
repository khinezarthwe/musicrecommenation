Oh, like many a male, I get angst in my pants And goddamn it to hell, It don't help if I dance And you, you're not doing too well All the blogs are about you, girl They caught you in the park after dark Giving head to a statue, girl Oh, cruel! You're on your honeymoon And you're sending me notes You hope to see me soon, You've got "see" wrapped in quotes I used to find it funny to say," What's your man got to do with me?" But then I saw him downtown, Placing bets on the hounds He was as big as a house! We can't be messin' around! Oooh, every time we kiss, It's like an inside joke I always miss. Our love is like a tug-of-war Don't touch me girl, I can't hug no more! Every time we kiss, It's like an inside joke I always miss. Our love is like a tug-of-war Don't touch me girl, I can't hug no more!
