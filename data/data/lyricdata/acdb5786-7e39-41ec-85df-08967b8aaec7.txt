Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were youngIn a world of magnets and miraclesOur thoughts strayed constantly and without boundaryThe ringing of the division bell had begunAlong the long road and on down the causewayDo they still meet there by the CutThere was a ragged band that followed in our footstepsRunning before time took our dreams awayLeaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the groundTo a life consumed by slow decayThe grass was greenerThe light was brighterWith friends surroundedThe nights of wonderLooking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind usTo a glimpse of how green it was on the other sideSteps taken forwards but sleepwalking back againDragged by the force of some inner tideAt a higher altitude with flag unfurledWe reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of worldEncumbered forever by desire and ambitionThere's a hunger still unsatisfiedOur weary eyes still stray to the horizonThough down this road we've been so many timesThe grass was greenerThe light was brighterThe taste was sweeterThe nights of wonderWith friends surroundedThe dawn mist glowingThe water flowingThe endless riverForever and ever
