You dance real slowYou wreck it downYou walk away, then youTurn aroundWhat did that old blondeGal say?That is the part...You throw awayI want that beggars eyesA winning horseA tidy Mexican divorceSt. Mary's prayersHoudini's HandsAnd a Barman who alwaysUnderstandsWill you loose the flowersHold on to the vaseWill you wipe all those teardropsAway from your faceI can't help thinkingAs I close the doorI have done all of thisMany times beforeThe bone must goThe wish can stayThe kiss don't knowWhat the lips will sayForget I've hurt youPut stones in your bedAnd remember to neverMind insteadWell all of your lettersBurned up in the fireTime is just memoryMixed in with DesireThat's not the road it isOnly the map...I sayGone just like matchesFrom a closed down cabaretIn a Portuguese SaloonA fly is a circling aroundThe roomYou'll soon forget theTune that you playFor that is the partYou throw awayAh, that is the partYou throw away
