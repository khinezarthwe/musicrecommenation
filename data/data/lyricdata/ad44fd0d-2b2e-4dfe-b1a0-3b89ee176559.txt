I saw you tonight Through the dim twilight It was deep, deep summer With that yellow moon And you were sleeping I saw you tonight You were in your ghost Singing White Christmas How you know It's before me It's your song So divine Dying time Is a part Of your laughter I saw you today Selling all your clothes You were done with Hollywood The waterfall was rushing Through you I saw you today Run away finally Coastal envy got you And we got you Blazing It's your song So divine It was time For the spread Of your laughter Greet me with flushed chest again Morning bird I'll wait for you How could I not? How could I not? Greet me with flushed chest again Morning bird I'll wait for you How could I not? How could I not? I saw you, the morning The early green Took the back seat And cream the dream is you Has begun I saw you so early In the whisky dark Your eyes were brightest black You were not going back It was your living It's your song From the past It was back For the start Of your laughter Greet me with flushed chest again Morning bird I'll wait for you How could I not? How could I not? Greet me with flushed chest again Morning bird I'll wait for you How could I not? How could I not?
