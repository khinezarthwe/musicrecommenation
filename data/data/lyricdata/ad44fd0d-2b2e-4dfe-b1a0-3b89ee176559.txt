I saw you tonightThrough the dim twilightIt was deep, deep summerWith that yellow moonAnd you were sleepingI saw you tonightYou were in your ghostSinging White ChristmasHow you knowIt's before meIt's your songSo divineDying timeIs a partOf your laughterI saw you todaySelling all your clothesYou were done with HollywoodThe waterfall was rushingThrough youI saw you todayRun away finallyCoastal envy got youAnd we got youBlazingIt's your songSo divineIt was timeFor the spreadOf your laughterGreet me with flushed chest againMorning bird I'll wait for youHow could I not?How could I not?Greet me with flushed chest againMorning bird I'll wait for youHow could I not?How could I not?I saw you, the morningThe early greenTook the back seatAnd cream the dream is youHas begunI saw you so earlyIn the whisky darkYour eyes were brightest blackYou were not going backIt was your livingIt's your songFrom the pastIt was backFor the startOf your laughterGreet me with flushed chest againMorning bird I'll wait for youHow could I not?How could I not?Greet me with flushed chest againMorning bird I'll wait for youHow could I not?How could I not?
