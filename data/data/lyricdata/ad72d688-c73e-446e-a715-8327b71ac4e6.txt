Trapped on the terraces, I looked at you and knewYou were the only thing that mattered, there was no one for me but youIn Harmony Street, we beat a man just for standing thereI held my breath as I watched you swing, then run your fingers through your hairOh, how could anyone not love the terrible things you do?Oh, how could anyone not want to try and help you?In Bermondsey, in Burberry, you held me at the barricadeThe pigs arrived with tear gas, and I wept at the mistakes we madeWe stalked the streets like animals and danced as windows shatteredFor the island, for the thrill of it, for everything that matteredOh, how could anyone not want to rip it all apart?Oh, how could anyone not love your cold, black heart?I found you on a Saturday and that was where I lost youYou had to finally walk away because of what it cost youYears later on, I saw your face in line to catch the morning trainYou looked like you'd been softened, like you never really loved the painOh, how could anyone not finally diminish?The thrill of blood comes instantly, there's only darkness at the finishMeet me at the barricadeI'll be at the barricadeMeet me at the barricadeThe love died, but the hate can't fadeI'll be at the barricadeThe love died, but the hate can't fade
