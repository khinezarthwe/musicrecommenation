Where do we go from here?The words are coming out all weird, where are you nowWhen I need you?Alone on an aeroplaneFalling asleep against the window paneMy blood will thickenI need to wash myself againTo hide all the dirt and pain 'cause I'd be scaredThat there's nothing underneathAnd who are my real friends?Have they all got the bends, am I really sinkingThis low?My baby's got the bends, oh noWe don't have any real friends, no, no, noI'm just lying in a bar with my drip feed onTalking to my girlfriend waiting for something to happenAnd I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happyI wish, I wish, I wish that something would happenWhere do we go from here?The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fearAnd where are you?They brought in the CIAThe tanks and the whole marines to blow me awayTo blow me sky highMy baby's got the bendsWe don't have any real friendsI'm just lying in a bar with my drip feed onTalking to my girlfriend waiting for something to happenI wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happyI wish, I wish, I wish that something would happenI want to live and breatheI want to be part of the human raceI want to live and breatheI want to be part of the human race, race, race, raceWhere do we go from here?The words are coming out all weird, where are you nowWhen I need you?
