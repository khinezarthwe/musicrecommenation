He's got fasting black lungsMade of clove-splintered shardsThey're the kind that will talkThrough a wheezing of coughsAnd I hear him every night in every poreAnd every time, he just makes me warmFreeze without an answer, free from all the shameMust I hide 'cause I'll never, never sleep aloneLook at how they flock to himFrom an isle of open soresHe knows that the taste is such, is such to die forAnd I hear him every night on every streetThe scales that do slither deliver me fromFreeze without an answer, free from all the shameThen I'll hide 'cause I'll never, never sleep aloneOh LordSaid I'm, said I'm, said I'mSaid I'm bloodshot for surePale runs the ghostSaid I'm, said I'm swollen on the shoreSwollen on the shoreAnd every night in every poreThe scales that do slither deliver me fromFreeze without an answer, free from all the shameThen I'll hide 'cause I'll never, never sleep aloneFreeze without an answer, free from all the shameLet me die 'cause I'll never, never sleep aloneAlone, aloneAlone, aloneAlone, aloneAlone, alone
