He's got fasting black lungs Made of clove-splintered shards They're the kind that will talk Through a wheezing of coughs And I hear him every night in every pore And every time, he just makes me warm Freeze without an answer, free from all the shame Must I hide 'cause I'll never, never sleep alone Look at how they flock to him From an isle of open sores He knows that the taste is such, is such to die for And I hear him every night on every street The scales that do slither deliver me from Freeze without an answer, free from all the shame Then I'll hide 'cause I'll never, never sleep alone Oh Lord Said I'm, said I'm, said I'm Said I'm bloodshot for sure Pale runs the ghost Said I'm, said I'm swollen on the shore Swollen on the shore And every night in every pore The scales that do slither deliver me from Freeze without an answer, free from all the shame Then I'll hide 'cause I'll never, never sleep alone Freeze without an answer, free from all the shame Let me die 'cause I'll never, never sleep alone Alone, alone Alone, alone Alone, alone Alone, alone
