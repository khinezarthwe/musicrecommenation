Lately I find myself out gazing at starsHearing guitars like someone in loveSometimes the things I do astound meMostly whenever you're around meLately I seem to walk as though I have wingsAnd to sing like someone in loveEach time I look at you I'm light as a cloudAnd feeling like someone in love.Sometimes the things I do astound meMostly whenever you're around me.Lately I seem to walk as though I have wingsBump into things like someone in loveEach time I look at you I'm light as a cloudAnd feeling like someone in loveLike someone in love, Like someone in love
