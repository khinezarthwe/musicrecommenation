She is smiling like heaven is down on earthThe sun is shining so bright on herAnd all her wishes have finally come trueAnd her heart is weeping.This happiness is killing herIt's true she's in loveShe'll be right here in my armsSo in loveShe'll be right here in these armsShe can't let goShe'll be right here in my armsSo in loveShe'll be right here in these armsShe can't let goSo hard she's tryingBut her heart won't turn to stone...oh noShe keeps on cryingBut I won't leave her aloneShe'll never be aloneShe'll be right here in my armsSo in loveShe'll be right here in these armsShe can't let goShe'll be right here in my armsSo in loveShe'll be right here in these armsShe can't let goAnd she'll be right here in my armsSo in loveShe'll be right here in these armsShe can't let go[Repeat 3x and fade out]
