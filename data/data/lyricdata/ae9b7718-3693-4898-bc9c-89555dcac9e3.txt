You fault my prideDon't ever need to apologizeAs your lips unfoldShaking purple from the coldYou better learn to crawlYou better learn to crawlBefore I walk awayBefore I walk awayYou broke my mouthThe bloody bits are spitting outIs your grave unscathed?The worm is counting down the dayHe wants to see you crawlHe wants to see you crawlBefore I walk awayBefore I walk awayThe reds and the whites and abusedThe crucified USAAs every prophecy unfoldsOh, Hell is surely on its wayAs the rat and the flyThey're searching for an alibiAs we wait the wrathThey never went to Sunday MassThey want to see us crawlThey want to see us crawlBefore they walk awayBefore they walk awayThe reds and the whites and abusedThe crucified USAAs every prophecy unfoldsOh, Hell is surely on its way
