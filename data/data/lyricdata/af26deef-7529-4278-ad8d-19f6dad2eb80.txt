My heart is brokenHere in the cup of my handsFrom between cracked fingersOld blood spillsI had to move on, babyFor when I tasted my own tearsThey were too sweetAnd I knew that I had come too closeAnd I have tried to shine in the darknessEntertaining vanities in vainFall deeperFall deeperMy heart is brokenHere in the cup of my handsFrom between cracked fingersOld blood spillsI had to move on, babyFor when I tasted my own tearsThey were too sweetThen I knew that I had come too closeAnd I have tried to shine in the darknessEntertaining vanities in vainBut now won't you come with meAs I open my eyesAnd hold onHold onAnd let goLet goLet the virus live a lifeHold onAnd hold onAnd let goLet goAnd fall deeperEven than loveEven than loveHold onAnd fall deeperEven than loveEven than loveEven than loveEven than love
