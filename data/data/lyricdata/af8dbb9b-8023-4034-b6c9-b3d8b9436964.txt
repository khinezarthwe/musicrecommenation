Don't make me come to VegasDon't make me pull you out of his bedI am vigilant that it will not be youOn the menu he's serving up for his friendsDon't make me come to VegasDon't make me pull him out of your headAthena will attest that it could be doneAnd it has been done and I think that I am up to itAnd the Jacaranda treeShe is telling me of the trouble you're inJust by the way she bendsRemember dancing and wondering as you were swayingWhat kind of woman you'd beOver my dead bodySlip through your handAgain and againMy old flame was a jester and a jokerAnd as dealer of men, they called him the princeA prince of black jacks and of womenAnd of anything that slipped into his handsAnd the ranches and the mustangsAnd the way you said, "You can't have all this except for meYou see Lady Luck is my mistressAnd you'll have to play second to her wish."And the Jacaranda treeIs telling me it's not over yetJust by the way she bends"If you come breezing through"You said, "I'll know that it's youBy the taste on my lips."Bet on the desert's kissI could slip through your net"Over my dead body"Slip through your handAgain and againSlip through your handAgain and againDon't make me come to VegasDon't make me come to VegasDon't make me come to Vegas
