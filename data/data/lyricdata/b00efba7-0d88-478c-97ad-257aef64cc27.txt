The taste of life I can't describeIt's choking on my mindReaching out, I can't believeFaith it can't decideOn and on, I carry onBut underneath my mindAnd on and on I tell myselfIt's this I can't disguiseOh, can't you seeHolding on to my heart I bleedThe taste of life?The pace, the time, I can't surviveIt's grinding down the viewBreaking out which way to chooseA choice I can't renewOn and on, I carry onBut underneath my mindAnd on and on, I tell myselfIt's this I can't disguiseOh, can't you see?Holding on to my heart,I bleedNo place is safe, can't you seeThe taste of life?
