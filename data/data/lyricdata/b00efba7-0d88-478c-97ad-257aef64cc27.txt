The taste of life I can't describe It's choking on my mind Reaching out, I can't believe Faith it can't decide On and on, I carry on But underneath my mind And on and on I tell myself It's this I can't disguise Oh, can't you see Holding on to my heart I bleed The taste of life? The pace, the time, I can't survive It's grinding down the view Breaking out which way to choose A choice I can't renew On and on, I carry on But underneath my mind And on and on, I tell myself It's this I can't disguise Oh, can't you see? Holding on to my heart, I bleed No place is safe, can't you see The taste of life?
