Rows of houses all bearing down on meI can feel their blue hands touching meAll these things into positionAll these things we'll one day swallow wholeAnd fade out againAnd fade outThis machine will, will not communicateThese thoughts and the strain I am underBe a world child, form a circleBefore we all go underAnd fade out againAnd fade out againCracked eggs, dead birds scream as they fight for lifeI can feel death, can see its beady eyesAll these things into positionAll these things we'll one day swallow wholeAnd fade out againAnd fade out againImmerse your soul in loveImmerse your soul in love
