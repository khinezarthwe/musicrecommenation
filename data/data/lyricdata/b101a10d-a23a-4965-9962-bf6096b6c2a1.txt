What you at my gentle spoken friendI lack a frame to put you inWhen you're an ocean and a rock awayI feel you in the pocket of my overcoatMy fingers wrap around your wordsAnd take the shape of games we playI feed your words through my buttonholesI pin them to my fingerless glovesThey're green and prone to frayingThoughts of you warm my bonesI'm on the way, I'm on the phoneLet's get lost, me and youAn ocean and a rock is nothing to meI am far away from where you lay awakeThe day while you fall to sleepAn ocean and a rock awayI keep you in the pockets of my dressesAnd the bristles of my brushesSpin you into my curls todayI spoon you into my coffee cupSpin you through a delicate washI wear you all dayI wear you all dayThoughts of you warm my bonesI'm on the way, I'm on the phoneLet's get lost, me and youAn ocean and a rock is nothing to meThoughts of you they warm my bonesI'm on the way, I'm nearly homeLet's get lost, me and youAn ocean and a rock is nothing to me
