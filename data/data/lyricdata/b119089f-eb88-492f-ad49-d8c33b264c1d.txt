Too far away from the citySome kids left on their ownThey said we had a communist in the familyI had to wear a maskToo far away from the cityWe had to make this roomFathers were football players, Volvo workers, policemenWhat the mothers did I didn't knowMusic tonightI just want your music tonightI saw her by the organShe was laughing while pressing the keysShe said my favourite book was dirty and"You should not show you can read"Too far away from the cityWe never heard its noiseWe learned how to stay fit and things likeGreen tones hide the blushMusic tonightI just want your music tonightMusic tonightI just want your music tonightToo far away from the cityWe came to breathe clean airNature lovers' safe oasisAnd the mothers walked towards the forestMusic tonightI just want your music tonightMusic tonightI just want your music tonight
