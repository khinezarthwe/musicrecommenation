Here on these cliffs of DoverSo high you can't see overAnd while your head is spinningHold tight, it's just beginningYou come from parents wantonA childhood rough and rottenI come from wealth and beautyUntouched by work or dutyAnd oh, my love, my loveAnd oh, my love, my loveWe both go down togetherI found you a tattooed trampA dirty daughter from the labor campsI laid you down in the grass of a clearingYou wept but your soul was willingAnd oh, my love, my loveAnd oh, my love, my loveWe both go down togetherAnd my parents will never consent to this loveBut I hold your handMeet me on my vast verandaMy sweet, untouched MirandaAnd while the seagulls are cryingWe fall but our souls are flyingAnd oh, my love, my loveAnd oh, my love, my loveAnd oh, my love, oh, my loveAnd oh, my love, my loveWe both go down together
