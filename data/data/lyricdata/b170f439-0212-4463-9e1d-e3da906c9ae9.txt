I can't remember when it was goodMoments of happiness eludeMaybe I just misunderstoodAll of the love we left behindWatching the flash backs intertwineMemories I will never findSo I'll love whatever you becomeAnd forget the reckless things we've doneI think our lives have just begunI think our lives have just begunAnd I'll feel my world crumblingI'll feel my life crumblingI'll feel my soul crumbling awayAnd falling awayFalling away with youStaying awake to chase a dreamTasting the air you're breathing inI hope I won't forget a thingPromise to hold you close and prayWatching the fantasies decayNothing will ever stay the sameAnd all of the love we threw awayAnd all of the hopes we've cherished fadeMaking the same mistakes againMaking the same mistakes againAnd I'll feel my world crumblingI'll feel my life crumblingI'll feel my soul crumbling awayAnd falling awayFalling away with youAll of the love we left behindWatching the flash backs intertwineMemories I will never findMemories I will never find
