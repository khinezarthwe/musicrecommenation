Let me take your hand, I'm shaking like milkTurning, turning blue all over the windows and the floorsFires outside in the sky look as perfect as catsThe two of us together again but it's just the same, a stupid gameBut I don't care if you don'tAnd I don't feel if you don'tAnd I don't want it if you don'tAnd I won't say it if you don't say it firstYou think you're tired now but wait until threeLaughing at the Christmas, lights you remember from DecemberAll of this then back again, another girl, another nameStay alive but stay the same, it's a stupid game, a stupid gameBut I don't care if you don'tAnd I don't feel if you don'tAnd I don't want it if you don'tAnd I won't play it if you don't play it firstYou can't even see now so you ask me the wayYou wonder if it's real because it couldn't be rainThrough the right doorway and into the white roomIt used to be the dust that would lay here when I came here aloneBut I don't care if you don'tAnd I don't feel if you don'tAnd I don't want it if you don'tAnd I won't play it if you don't play it firstLet's go to bed
