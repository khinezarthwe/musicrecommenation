Something's wrong 'cause my mind is fading,And everywhere I look there's a dead end waitingTemperature's dropping at the rotten oasisStealing kisses from the leperous facesHeads are hanging from the garbage man treesMouthwash, jukebox, gasolinePistols are pointing at a poor man's pocketsSmiling eyes whipping out of their socketsGot a devil's haircut in my mindGot a devil's haircut in my mindGot a devil's haircut in my mindGot a devil's haircut in my mindLove machines on the sympathy crutchesDiscount orgies on the dropout busesHitching a ride with the bleeding nosesComing to town with the briefcase bluesGot a devil's haircut in my mindGot a devil's haircut in my mindGot a devil's haircut in my mindGot a devil's haircut in my mindSomething's wrong 'cause my mind is fadingGhetto-blasting disintegratingRock 'n' roll, know what I'm saying?And everywhere I look, there's a devil in waitingGot a devil's haircut in my mindGot a devil's haircut in my mindGot a devil's haircut in my mindGot a devil's haircut in my mindDevil's haircut! In my mind!Devil's haircut! In my mind!Devil's haircut! In my mind!
