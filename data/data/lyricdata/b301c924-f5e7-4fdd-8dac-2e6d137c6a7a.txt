Hello big family who's gonna cook the noodles today I found a pair of broken glasses and finally I can see clearly From Falsterbo to Kiruna, from GÃ¶teborg to Djursholmand even one lost guy from Arizona Home sweet home, I'vebeen away for too long Home sweet home,this is where I belong Going to bed wondering if winter come early this year Waking up on the line of equator bathing in my own sweat Jumping out of someones tent and I don't recongnize a face Still I know them all well so see you later Let's get nice and friendly, join us for a surfride in the mud We're out for beerhunt, look out for our razzia, hands up, hit and run Playing football with a can, Mr J lost his shoe Suck my menthol feeling fresh all night long
