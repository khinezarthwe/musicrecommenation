Find your dreams come trueAnd I wonder if you knowWhat it means, what it meansAnd I wonder if you knowWhat it means, what it meansAnd I wonder if you knowWhat it means to find your dreamsI've been waiting on this my whole lifeThese dreams be waking me up at nightYou say I think I'm never wrongYou know what, maybe you're right, aightAnd I wonder if you knowWhat it means, what it meansAnd I wonder if you knowWhat it means to find your dreamsYou say he get on your fucking nervesYou hope that he get what he deserves, wordDo you even remember what the issue is?You just trying to find where the tissue isYou can still be who you wish you isIt ain't happen yetAnd that's what intuition isWhen you hop back in the carDrive back to the cribRun back to their armsThe smokescreensThe chokes and the screamsYou ever wonder what it all really means?And I wonder if you knowWhat it means, what it meansAnd I wonder if you knowWhat it means to find your dreamsAnd I'm back on my grindA psychic read my lifelineTold me in my lifetimeMy name would help light up the Chicago skylineAnd that's why I'mSeven o'clock, that's primetimeHeaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlinesWhy he keep giving me hot lines?I'm a star, how could I not shine?How many ladies in the house?How many ladies in the house without a spouse?Something in your blouse got me feeling so arousedWhat you about?On that independent shitTrade it all for a husband and some kidsYou ever wonder what it all really mean?You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams?
