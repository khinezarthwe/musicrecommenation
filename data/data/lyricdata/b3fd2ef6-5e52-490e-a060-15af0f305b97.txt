Do you rememberStanding on the shore,Head in the clouds,Your pockets filled with dreamsBound for gloryOn the seven seas of life,But, the ocean is deeper than it seemsThe wind was with youWhen you left on the morning tide,You set your sail for an island in the sun,On the horizon, dark clouds up ahead,For the storm has just begunTake me with you,Take me far away,Lead me to the distant shoreSail your ship across the water,Spread your wings across the skyTake the time to seeYou're the one who holds the key,Or sailing ships will pass you byYou cry for mercy,When you think you've lost your way,You drift alone, if all your hope is goneSo find the strength and you will seeYou control, your destiny,After all is said and doneSo take me with you,Take me far away,An' lead me to the distant shoreSail your ship across the water,Spread your wings across the skyTake the time to seeYou're the one who holds the key,Or sailing ships will pass,Sailing ships will pass you,Sailing ships will pass you by...Take me with you,Take me far away,We'll ride the wind across the skySpread your wings and you will seeYou control, your destiny,So sailing ships don't pass you bySo take me with you,Take me far away,We'll ride the wind across the skySpread your wings and you will seeYou control, your destiny,So sailing ships don't pass,So sailing ships don't pass you,So sailing ships don't pass you by...Baby, baby, baby, baby,You'll find that you're the only oneCan sail your ship across the sky
