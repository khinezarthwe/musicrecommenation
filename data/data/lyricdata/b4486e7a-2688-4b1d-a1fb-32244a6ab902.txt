Shakedown 1979Cool kids never have the timeOn a live wire right up off the streetYou and I should meetJunebug skipping like a stoneWith the headlights pointed at the dawnWe were sure we'd never see an endTo it allAnd I don't even care to shake these zipper bluesAnd we don't know just where our bones will restTo dust, I guessForgotten and absorbed to the earth belowDouble cross the vacant and the boredThey're not sure just what we have in storeMorphine city slippin' duesDown to seeThat we don't even care, as restless as we areWe feel the pull in the land of a thousand guiltsAnd poured cementLamented and assured to the lightsAnd towns belowFaster than the speed of soundFaster than we thought we'd goBeneath the sound of hopeJustine never knew the rulesHung down with the freaks and ghoulsNo apologies ever need be madeI know you better than you fake it to seeThat we don't even care to shake these zipper bluesAnd we don't know just where our bones will restTo dust, I guessForgotten and absorbed to the earth belowThe street heats the urgency of nowAs you see, there's no one around
