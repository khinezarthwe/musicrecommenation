Crown of leaves, high in the window on a gold morningYoung today, old as a railroad tomorrowDays are just drops in the river to be lost alwaysOnly you, only you, you knowYears ago, birds of a feather would arrive nightlyGone you know, held to another like clutched ivyOn the shore, speak to the ocean and receive silenceOnly you, only you, you knowYou hesitate, so my memory fadesI'll hold to the first one"I wouldn't turn to another," you sayOn the long night we've madeLet it goOnly you, only you, you knowOnly you, only you, you knowYou hesitate, so my memory fadesI'll hold to the first one"I wouldn't turn to another," you sayOn the long night we've madeLet it goLet it goSpeak to me slow, my dearNo ghost, of course, in herePleased to be lonesome, quiet and clearAll is alone in here
