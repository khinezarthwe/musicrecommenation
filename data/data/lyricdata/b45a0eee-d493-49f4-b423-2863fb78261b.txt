He's so the purity, a shaving and a mourning And standing on a pigeon toe in his disarray Straight in the picture pose, he's coming around to meet you And screaming like a battle cry, it's more if I stay Me and your cold, driving in the snow Let the good times roll, let the good times roll Cowgirl king of the rodeo Let the good times roll, let the good times roll How dare you come to me like Withnail for a favor Ah, hold on, not my fairy tale you're trying to start Take off your overcoat, you're staying for the weekend And swaying like a smokey grey, a drink in the park Me and your cold, driving in the snow Let the good times roll, let the good times roll Cowgirl king of the rodeo Let the good times roll, let the good times roll Good time to roll on
