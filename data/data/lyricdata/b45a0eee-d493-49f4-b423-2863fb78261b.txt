He's so the purity, a shaving and a mourningAnd standing on a pigeon toe in his disarrayStraight in the picture pose, he's coming around to meet youAnd screaming like a battle cry, it's more if I stayMe and your cold, driving in the snowLet the good times roll, let the good times rollCowgirl king of the rodeoLet the good times roll, let the good times rollHow dare you come to me like Withnail for a favorAh, hold on, not my fairy tale you're trying to startTake off your overcoat, you're staying for the weekendAnd swaying like a smokey grey, a drink in the parkMe and your cold, driving in the snowLet the good times roll, let the good times rollCowgirl king of the rodeoLet the good times roll, let the good times rollGood time to roll on
