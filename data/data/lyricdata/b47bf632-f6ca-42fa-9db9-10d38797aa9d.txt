All I can ever be to you is a darkness that we knewAnd this regret I got accustomed toOnce it was so right when we were at our heightWaiting for you in the hotel at nightI knew I hadn't met my match but every moment we could snatchI don't know why I got so attachedIt's my responsibility you don't owe nothing to meBut to walk away, I have no capacityHe walks away, the sun goes downHe takes the day but I'm goneAnd in your way in this blue shadeMy tears dry on their ownI don't understand, why do I stress a manWhen there's so many bigger things at handWe could've never had it all, we had to hit a wallSo this is inevitable withdrawalEven if I stop wanting you, and perspective pushes trueI'll be some next man's other woman soonI cannot play myself again, I should just be my own best friendNot fuck myself in the head with stupid menHe walks away, the sun goes downHe takes the day but I'm goneAnd in your way in this blue shadeMy tears dry on their ownSo we are history, your shadow covers meThe sky above, a blazeHe walks away, the sun goes downHe takes the day but I'm goneAnd in your way in this blue shadeMy tears dry on their ownI wish I could say no regrets and no emotional debt'Cause as we kiss goodbye the sun setsSo we are history, the shadow covers meThe sky above, a blaze that only lovers seeHe walks away, the sun goes downHe takes the day but I'm goneAnd in your way in this blue shadeMy tears dry on their ownHe walks away, the sun goes downHe takes the day but I'm goneAnd in your way in this blue shadeMy tears dry on their ownHe walks away the sun goes downHe takes the day but I'm goneAnd in your way my deep shadeMy tears dry
