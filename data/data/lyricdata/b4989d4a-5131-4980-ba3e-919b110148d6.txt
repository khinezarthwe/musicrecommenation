Day to day Where do you want to be?' Cos now you're trying to pick a fight With everyone you need You seem like a soldier Who's lost his composure You're wounded and play a waiting game In no-man's land no-one's to blame See the world Find an old fashioned girl And when all's been said and done It's the things that are given, not won Are the things that you want Empty handed, surrounded by a senseless scene With nothing of significance Besides a shadow of a dream You sound like an old joke You're worn-out, a bit broke An' askin me time and time again When the answer's still the same See the world Find an old fashioned girl And when all's been said and done It's the things that are given, not won Are the things that you want You've got a chance to put things right So how's it going to be? Lay down your arms now And put us beyond doubt So reach out it's not too far away Don't mess around now, don't delay
