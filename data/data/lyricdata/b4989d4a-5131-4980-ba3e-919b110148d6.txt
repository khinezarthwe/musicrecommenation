Day to dayWhere do you want to be?'Cos now you're trying to pick a fightWith everyone you needYou seem like a soldierWho's lost his composureYou're wounded and play a waiting gameIn no-man's land no-one's to blameSee the worldFind an old fashioned girlAnd when all's been said and doneIt's the things that are given, not wonAre the things that you wantEmpty handed, surrounded by a senseless sceneWith nothing of significanceBesides a shadow of a dreamYou sound like an old jokeYou're worn-out, a bit brokeAn' askin me time and time againWhen the answer's still the sameSee the worldFind an old fashioned girlAnd when all's been said and doneIt's the things that are given, not wonAre the things that you wantYou've got a chance to put things rightSo how's it going to be?Lay down your arms nowAnd put us beyond doubtSo reach out it's not too far awayDon't mess around now, don't delay
