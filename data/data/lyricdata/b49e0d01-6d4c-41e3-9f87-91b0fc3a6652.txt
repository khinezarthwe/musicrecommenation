Anda my love Wake up to your window The day calls in billows It's echoing moonlight onto the blue nightmare of your heart In cosy red rainbow It's shaking off halos And the memory of our sacred so and so's Oh, take my hand sweet Complete your release Unbury your feet And married we'll be Alone in receiving ours is a feeling Not that they would see They don't know that we could be Down where your cradle escaped the sea And your raven-haired mama caught told you so's We're laying in the shadow of your family tree Your haunted heart and me Brought down by an old idea whose time has come And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree There's a hundred hearts or three Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young Ah me all mine Is it safe to say that we've waited patiently Call me on time And recall the tune that has placed us gracefully All into line There's a garden grave and a place there saved for you I fall by your side Though your silver-haired mama throws told-you so's We're laying in the shadow of your family tree Your haunted heart and me Brought down by an old idea whose time has come And in the shadow of the gallows of your family tree There's a hundred hearts or three Pumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them young Now we're gathered in the shadow of your family tree In halted harmony Brought down by an old idea whose time has come And in the shadow of the valley of your family tree There's a hundred hearts or three Pumping blood to the roots of Eden to keep us young
