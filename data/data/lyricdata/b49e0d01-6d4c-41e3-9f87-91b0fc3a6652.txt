Anda my loveWake up to your windowThe day calls in billowsIt's echoing moonlight onto the blue nightmare of your heartIn cosy red rainbowIt's shaking off halosAnd the memory of our sacred so and so'sOh, take my hand sweetComplete your releaseUnbury your feetAnd married we'll beAlone in receiving ours is a feelingNot that they would seeThey don't know that we could beDown where your cradle escaped the seaAnd your raven-haired mama caught told you so'sWe're laying in the shadow of your family treeYour haunted heart and meBrought down by an old idea whose time has comeAnd in the shadow of the gallows of your family treeThere's a hundred hearts or threePumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them youngAh me all mineIs it safe to say that we've waited patientlyCall me on timeAnd recall the tune that has placed us gracefullyAll into lineThere's a garden grave and a place there saved for youI fall by your sideThough your silver-haired mama throws told-you so'sWe're laying in the shadow of your family treeYour haunted heart and meBrought down by an old idea whose time has comeAnd in the shadow of the gallows of your family treeThere's a hundred hearts or threePumping blood to the roots of evil to keep them youngNow we're gathered in the shadow of your family treeIn halted harmonyBrought down by an old idea whose time has comeAnd in the shadow of the valley of your family treeThere's a hundred hearts or threePumping blood to the roots of Eden to keep us young
