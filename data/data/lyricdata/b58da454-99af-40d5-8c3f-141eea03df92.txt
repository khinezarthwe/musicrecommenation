Is it cruel or kind not to speak my mindAnd to lie to you, rather than hurt you?Well, I'll confess all of my sins after several large ginsBut still I'll hide from you, hide what's inside from youAnd alarm bells ring when you say your heart still singsWhen you're with me, oh, won't you please forgive meI no longer hear the musicOh no, no, no, no, noAnd all the memories of the pubs, and the clubs, and the drugs, and the tubsWe shared together, they'll stay with me foreverBut all the highs, and the lows, and the to's, and the fro'sThey left me dizzy, oh, won't you please forgive meI no longer hear the musicOh no, no, no, noWell, I no longer hear the Music when the lights go outLove goes cold in the shades of doubtThe strange face in my mind is all too clearMusic when the lights come onThe girl I thought I knew has goneAnd with her my heart, it disappearedWell, I no longer hear the musicOh no, no, noAll the memories of the fights and nights under blue lights, all the kitesWe flew together, love thought they'll fly foreverBut all the highs, and the lows, and the to's, and the fro'sThey left me dizzy, Won't you forgive meI no longer hear the musicI no longer hear the musicI no longer hear the music when the lights go outLove goes cold in the shades of doubtThe strange face in my mind is all too clearMusic when the lights come onThe girl I thought I knew has goneAnd with her my heart, it disappearedI no longer hear the musicOh no, noI no longer hear the music
