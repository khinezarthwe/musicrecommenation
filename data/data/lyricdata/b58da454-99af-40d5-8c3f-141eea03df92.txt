Is it cruel or kind not to speak my mind And to lie to you, rather than hurt you? Well, I'll confess all of my sins after several large gins But still I'll hide from you, hide what's inside from you And alarm bells ring when you say your heart still sings When you're with me, oh, won't you please forgive me I no longer hear the music Oh no, no, no, no, no And all the memories of the pubs, and the clubs, and the drugs, and the tubs We shared together, they'll stay with me forever But all the highs, and the lows, and the to's, and the fro's They left me dizzy, oh, won't you please forgive me I no longer hear the music Oh no, no, no, no Well, I no longer hear the Music when the lights go out Love goes cold in the shades of doubt The strange face in my mind is all too clear Music when the lights come on The girl I thought I knew has gone And with her my heart, it disappeared Well, I no longer hear the music Oh no, no, no All the memories of the fights and nights under blue lights, all the kites We flew together, love thought they'll fly forever But all the highs, and the lows, and the to's, and the fro's They left me dizzy, Won't you forgive me I no longer hear the music I no longer hear the music I no longer hear the music when the lights go out Love goes cold in the shades of doubt The strange face in my mind is all too clear Music when the lights come on The girl I thought I knew has gone And with her my heart, it disappeared I no longer hear the music Oh no, no I no longer hear the music
