And he's half in love with Elizabeth And he's half in love with you And some things are too painful to say out loud Well, they live behind a veil and see through a shroud Words fly from his mouth, like paper butterflies They flutter around and burn holes in your side And he's half in love with Elizabeth And he's half in love with you I knew that you were thinking of him last night' Cause I saw the blood seep down to your toes Turn away if you must but how can you put your trust In a man who always sleeps in his clothes? And he's half in love with Elizabeth And he's half in love with you Yes, he's half in love with Elizabeth And he's half in love with you You're the sweet scent on an envelope A folded photo in his purse But if you pin your hopes to his back my dear I'm afraid the bubble will burst The bubble will burst The bubble will burst The bubble will burst The bubble will burst The bubble will burst The bubble will burst The bubble will burst And he's half in love with Elizabeth And he's half in love with you And he's half in love with Elizabeth And he's half in love with you Yes, he's half in love with Elizabeth And he's half in love with you
