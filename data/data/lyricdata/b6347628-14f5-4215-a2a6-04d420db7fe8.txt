And he's half in love with ElizabethAnd he's half in love with youAnd some things are too painful to say out loudWell, they live behind a veil and see through a shroudWords fly from his mouth, like paper butterfliesThey flutter around and burn holes in your sideAnd he's half in love with ElizabethAnd he's half in love with youI knew that you were thinking of him last night'Cause I saw the blood seep down to your toesTurn away if you must but how can you put your trustIn a man who always sleeps in his clothes?And he's half in love with ElizabethAnd he's half in love with youYes, he's half in love with ElizabethAnd he's half in love with youYou're the sweet scent on an envelopeA folded photo in his purseBut if you pin your hopes to his back my dearI'm afraid the bubble will burstThe bubble will burstThe bubble will burstThe bubble will burstThe bubble will burstThe bubble will burstThe bubble will burstThe bubble will burstAnd he's half in love with ElizabethAnd he's half in love with youAnd he's half in love with ElizabethAnd he's half in love with youYes, he's half in love with ElizabethAnd he's half in love with you
