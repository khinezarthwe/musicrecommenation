The last time ever she saw himCarried away by a moonlight shadowHe passed on worried and warningCarried away by a moonlight shadowLost in a riddle that Saturday nightFar away on the other sideHe was caught in the middle of a desperate fightAnd she couldn't find how to push throughThe trees that whisper in the eveningCarried away by a moonlight shadowSing a song of sorrow and grievingCarried away by a moonlight shadowAll she saw was a silhouette of a gunFar away on the other sideHe was shot six times by a man on the runAnd she couldn't find how to push throughI stay, I praySee you in Heaven far awayI stay, I praySee you in Heaven one dayFour A.M. in the morningCarried away by a moonlight shadowI watched your vision formingCarried away by a moonlight shadowA star was glowing in the silvery nightFar away on the other sideWill you come to talk to me this nightBut she couldn't find how to push throughI stay, I praySee you in Heaven far awayI stay, I praySee you in Heaven one dayFar away on the other sideCaught in the middle of a hundred and fiveThe night was heavy and the air was aliveBut she couldn't find how to push throughCarried away by a moonlight shadowCarried away by a moonlight shadowFar away on the other side
