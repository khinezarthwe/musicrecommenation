Someone take these dreams awayThat point me to another dayA duel of personalitiesThat stretch all true realitiesThat keep calling meThey keep calling meKeep on calling meThey keep calling meWhen figures from the past stand tallAnd mocking voices ring the hallImperialistic house of prayerConquistadors who took their shareThat keep calling meThey keep calling meKeep on calling meThey keep calling meCalling meCalling meCalling meCalling meThey keep calling meKeep on calling meThey keep calling meThey keep calling me
