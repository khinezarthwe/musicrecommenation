I can't shake this feeling from my headThere's a devil sleeping in my bedHe's watching you from across the wayI cannot make this feeling go awayI know it's not the right thingAnd I know it's not the good thingBut kinda I want toKinda I want toI'm not sure of what I should doWhen every thought I'm thinking of is youAll of my excuses turn to liesMaybe God will cover up his eyesAnd I know it's not the right thingAnd I know it's not the good thingBut kinda I want toKinda I want toKinda I want toKinda I want toKinda I want to, maybe just for tonightWe can pretend it's alrightWhat's the price I payI don't care what they sayI want toI want toI want toI want toI want toI want toI want toI want to
