You bite through the big wall, the big wall bites backYou just sit there and sulk, sit there and bawlYou are so pretty when you're on your kneesDisaffected and eager to pleaseSometimes you sulk, sometimes you burnGod rest your soulWhen the loving comes and we've already goneJust like your dad, you'll never changeEach time it comes, it eats me aliveI try to behave but it eats me aliveSo I declare a holidayFall asleep, drift awaySometimes you sulk, sometimes you burnGod rest your soulWhen the loving comes and we've already goneJust like your dad, you'll never changeSometimes you sulk, sometimes you burnGod rest your soulWhen the loving comes and we've already goneJust like your dad, you'll never change
