My love is in league with the freewayIts passion will ride as the cities fly byAnd the taillights dissolve in the coming of nightAnd the questions, in thousands, take flightMy love is a-miles in the waitingThe eyes that just stare, and the glance at the clockAnd the secret that burns, and the pain that grows darkAnd it's you once againLeading me on (Leading me on)Leading me down the roadDriving beyond (Driving beyond)Driving me down the roadMy love is exceeding the limitRed-eyed and fevered with the hum of the milesDistance and longing, my thoughts do collideShould I rest for a while at the side?Your love is cradled in knowingEyes in the mirror, still expecting they'll comeAnd sensing too well when the journey is doneThere is no turning back, noThere is no turning backOn the runMy love is in league with the freewayOh, the freeway, and the coming of nighttimeMy love, my love is in league with the freeway
