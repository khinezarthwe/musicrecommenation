For you I was a flameLove is a losing gameFive story fire as you cameLove is a losing gameOne I wish I never playedOh, what a mess we madeAnd now the final frameLove is a losing gamePlayed out by the bandLove is a losing handMore than I could standLove is a losing handSelf professed profoundTill the chips were downKnow you're a gambling manLove is a losing handThough I battle blindLove is a fate resignedMemories mar my mindLove is a fate resignedOver futile oddsAnd laughed at by the GodsAnd now the final frameLove is a losing game
