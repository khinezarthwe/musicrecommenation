I'm floating in a black balloon O. D. on Easter afternoon My momma told me, " Baby, stay clean There's no in-between" But all you ladies and you gentlemen Between's all you've ever seen or been Fit poorly and arrange the sight Doll it up in virgin white You disappoint me You people raking in on the world The Devil's script sells You the heart of a blackbird Shine on me, baby' Cause it's raining in my heart Sun's rising on a choppy glare (yeah, yeah, yeah) Rain dropping acid brought up in the air A distorted reality is now a necessity To be free It's so disappointing At first I put it all down to luck God knows why my Country don't give a fuck Fuck Shine on me, baby' Cause it's raining in my heart Shine on me, baby' Cause it's raining in my heart
