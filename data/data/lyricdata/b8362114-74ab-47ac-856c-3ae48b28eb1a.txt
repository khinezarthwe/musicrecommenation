I saw the gap again today While you were begging me to stay Take care not to make me enter If I do, we both may disappear Know that I will choke until I swallow Choke this infant here before me What is this but my reflection? Who am I to judge or strike you down? But you're Pushing, shoving; pushing, shoving Pushing and shoving me; pushing and shoving me Pushing and shoving me; pushing and shoving me Pushing and shoving me Pushing me, shoving me You still love me; you still love me Push it on me; you shit on me You still love me; you still love me Push it on me; you shit on me Rest your trigger on my finger Bang my head upon the fault line You better take care not to make me enter,' Cause if I do, we both may disappear But you're Pushing and shoving; pushing and shoving Pushing and shoving me; pushing me, shoving me You still love me; you still love me Push it on me; you shit on me You're pushing and shoving me Pushing and shoving me Yeah, I'm slipping back into the gap again I'm alive when you're touching me Alive when you're shoving me down But I'd trade it all for just a little peace of mind Push it on me; push it on me Push it on me; push it on me You're pushing and shoving I'm scrambling to keep my feet flat on the ground I am somewhere I don't want to be Push me somewhere I don't want to be Put me somewhere I don't want to be Seeing someplace I don't want to see Never wanna see that place again I saw the gap again today While you were begging me to stay Managed to push myself away And you, as well, my dear If, when I say I might fade like a sigh if I stay You minimize my movement anyway I must persuade you another way Pushing and shoving and pushing and shoving and pushing me There's no love in fear I'm staring down the hole again Your hands are on my back again Survival is my only friend Terrified of what may come Remember, I will always love you As I claw your fucking throat away It will end no other way It will end no other way
