I saw a lightI saw a lightComing through the treesI saw a lightComing through the treesFreshly cut lawnsAnd little children sleepwalkingI saw a lightI saw the lightShining on a carAnd a couple insideHad committed suicideDeath in your armsDeath in your armsI saw a lightI saw a lightComing through the treesAnd I packed my thingsAfter I saw the lightI packed my thingsThe light gave me lifeAnd helped me see more clearlyAnd the children went to sleepAnd the car was towed awayAnd the leaves were rustlingAs the night turned to dayI saw a lightGetting smaller in the distanceAnd I said, "Goodbye"
