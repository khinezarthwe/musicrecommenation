How could you do itI couldn't sayYears built on sandJune until MaySecond to secondLied even while you held my handIt's death for the livingYes I am a ghostThe mirror is cloudyI loved you the mostYou threw out the piecesDid things we didn't understandHe doesn't want her but he just won't let her goHe doesn't want her but he just won't let her goShe started breaking but she still won't let it showHe doesn't want her but he just won't let her goThe clothes in the wardrobeJust send them to meThere are bills here for youThat's 'cause nothing is freeWe build up with thingsTo make us who we want to beIs she in the background?I just wouldn't knowDid I build you a prison?Please don't let me goI've unlocked the doorBut you can't walk away from meHe doesn't want her but he just won't let her goHe doesn't want her but he just won't let her goShe started breaking but she still won't let it showHe doesn't want her but he just won't let her goHe doesn't want her but he just won't let her goHe doesn't want her but he just won't let her goShe started breaking but she still won't let it showHe doesn't want her but he just won't let her go.
