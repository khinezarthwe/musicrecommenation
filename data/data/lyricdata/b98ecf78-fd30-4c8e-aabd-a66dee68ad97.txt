Hope there's someoneWho'll take care of meWhen I die, will I go?Hope there's someoneWho'll set my heart freeNice to hold when I'm tiredThere's a ghost on the horizonWhen I go to bedHow can I fall asleep at night?How will I rest my head?Oh I'm scared of the middle placeBetween light and nowhereI don't want to be the oneLeft in there, left in thereThere's a man on the horizonWish that I'd go to bedIf I fall to his feet tonightWill allow rest my head?So here's hoping I will not drownOr paralyze in lightAnd godsend I don't want to goTo the seal's watershedHope there's someoneWho'll take care of meWhen I die, will I go?Hope there's someoneWho'll set my heart freeNice to hold when I'm tired
