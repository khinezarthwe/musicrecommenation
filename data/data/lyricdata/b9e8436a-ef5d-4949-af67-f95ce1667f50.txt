I keep a close watch on this heart of mineI keep my eyes wide open all the timeI keep the ends out for the tie that bindsBecause you're mine, I walk the lineI find it very, very easy to be trueI find myself alone when each day is throughYes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for youBecause you're mine, I walk the lineAs sure as night is dark and day is lightI keep you on my mind both day and nightAnd happiness I've known proves that it's rightBecause you're mine, I walk the lineYou've got a way to keep me on your sideYou give me cause for love that I can't hideFor you I know I'd even try to turn the tideBecause you're mine, I walk the lineI keep a close watch on this heart of mineI keep my eyes wide open all the timeI keep the ends out for the tie that bindsBecause you're mine, I walk the line
