Was a long and dark December; from the rooftops I rememberThere was snow; white snowClearly I remember, from the windows they were watchingWhile we froze, down belowWhen the future's architectured by a carnival of idiotsOn show, you'd better lie lowIf you love me, won't you let me know?Was a long and dark December, when the banks became cathedralsAnd a fox became GodPriests clutched onto Bibles, hollowed out to fit their riflesAnd the cross was held aloftBury me in armour; when I'm dead and hit the groundMy nerves are poles that unfrozeAnd if you love me, won't you let me know?I don't want to be a soldier, who the captain of some sinking shipWould stow, far belowSo if you love me, why'd you let me go?I took my love down to Violet Hill; there we sat in snowAll that time she was silent stillSo if you love me, won't you let me know?If you love me, won't you let me know?
