7:30amNurse the baby on the couchThen the phone rings"Turn on the TV"Watch the world explode in flamesAnd don't leave the houseAnd the sky overheadIs silent, waitingClear blue holds its breathAnd the heart is hitIn a city far awayBut it feels so closeDon't breathe the air todayDon't speak of why you're afraid(Standing here on a one way roadAnd I fall down, and I fall downNo other direction for this to goAnd we fall down, and we fall down)Why can't I get alongWhy can't I get alongWhy can't I get along with you?And the president hidesWhile working men rush inAnd give their livesI look to the skyAnd ask it not to rainOn my family tonightDon't breathe the air todayDon't speak of why you're afraid(Standing here on a one way roadAnd I fall down, and I fall downNo other direction for this to goAnd we fall down, and we fall down)Why can't I get alongWhy can't I get alongWhy can't I get along with you?Don't breathe the air todayDon't speak of why you're afraid(Standing here on a one way roadAnd I fall down, and I fall downNo other direction for this to goAnd we fall down, and we fall down)Why can't I get alongWhy can't I get alongWhy can't I get along with you?
