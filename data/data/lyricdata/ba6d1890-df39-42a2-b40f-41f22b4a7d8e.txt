7:30am Nurse the baby on the couch Then the phone rings" Turn on the T V" Watch the world explode in flames And don't leave the house And the sky overhead Is silent, waiting Clear blue holds its breath And the heart is hit In a city far away But it feels so close Don't breathe the air today Don't speak of why you're afraid( Standing here on a one way road And I fall down, and I fall down No other direction for this to go And we fall down, and we fall down) Why can't I get along Why can't I get along Why can't I get along with you? And the president hides While working men rush in And give their lives I look to the sky And ask it not to rain On my family tonight Don't breathe the air today Don't speak of why you're afraid( Standing here on a one way road And I fall down, and I fall down No other direction for this to go And we fall down, and we fall down) Why can't I get along Why can't I get along Why can't I get along with you? Don't breathe the air today Don't speak of why you're afraid( Standing here on a one way road And I fall down, and I fall down No other direction for this to go And we fall down, and we fall down) Why can't I get along Why can't I get along Why can't I get along with you?
