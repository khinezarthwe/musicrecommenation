I pick things up, I am a collectorAnd things, well things they tend to accumulateI have this net, it drags behind meIt picks up feelings for me to feed uponThere are times, plenty of times I wish I could let it goBut they start to breathe and they start to grow inside meThere are times, plenty of times I wish I could let it goBut they start to make me think things I don't want to knowI'm trying to fit it all insideI'm trying to open my mouth wideI'm trying not to choke andSwallow it allSwallow it allSwallow it allSwallow it allI am the plague, I am the swarmAll your hurt sticks on me and I keep it warmThey make me stay, they won't let me leaveThere are so goddamn many of them, it gets hard to breatheI'm trying to fit it all insideI'm trying to open my mouth wideI'm trying not to choke insideI am a good boy and I willSwallow it allSwallow it allSwallow it allSwallow it allEvery last oneEvery last oneEvery last oneEvery last oneEvery last oneEvery last oneEvery last oneEvery last oneEvery last oneEvery last oneEvery last oneEvery last oneEvery last oneEvery last oneEvery last oneEvery last oneEvery last oneEvery last oneEvery last oneEvery last one
