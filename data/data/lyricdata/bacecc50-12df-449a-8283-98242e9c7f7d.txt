I'll tell you why I don't want to know where you areI got a joke I've been dying to tell youA silent kid is looking down the barrelTo make the noise that I kept so quietKept it from you, PitselehI'm not what's missing from your life nowI could never be the puzzle piecesThey say that God makes problemsJust to see what you could standBefore you do as the Devil pleasesGive up the thing you loveNo one deserves itThe first time I saw youI knew it would never lastI'm not half what I wish I wasI'm so angry, I don't think it'll ever passAnd I was bad news for you just becauseI never meant to hurt you
