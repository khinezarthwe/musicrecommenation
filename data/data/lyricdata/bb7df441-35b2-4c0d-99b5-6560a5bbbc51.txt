Call you up in the middle of the nightLike a firefly without a lightYou were there like a blow torch burningI was a key that could use a little turningSo tired that I couldn't even sleepSo many secrets I couldn't keepPromised myself I wouldn't weepOne more promise I couldn't keepIt seems no one can help me nowI'm in too deepThere's no way outThis time I have really led myself astrayRunaway train never going backWrong way on a one-way trackSeems like I should be getting somewhereSomehow I'm neither here nor thereCan you help me remember how to smileMake it somehow all seem worthwhileHow on earth did I get so jadedLife's mystery seems so fadedI can go where no one else can goI know what no one else knowsHere I am just drowning in the rainWith a ticket for a runaway trainAnd everything seems cut and dryDay and night, earth and skySomehow I just don't believe itRunaway train never going backWrong way on a one-way trackSeems like I should be getting somewhereSomehow I'm neither here nor thereBought a ticket for a runaway trainLike the madman laughing at the rainLittle out of touch, little insaneIt's just easier than dealing with the painRunaway train never going backWrong way on a one-way trackSeems like I should be getting somewhereSomehow I'm neither here nor thereRunaway train never coming backRunaway train tearing up the trackRunaway train burning in my veinsI run away but it always seems the same
