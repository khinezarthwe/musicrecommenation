Wanderers this morning came by Where did they go, graceful in the morning light? To banner fair To follow you softly in the cold mountain air Through the forest, down to your grave Where the birds wait and the tall grasses wave They do not know you anymore More, more, more Dear shadow, alive and well How can the body die? You tell me everything Anything true Into town, one morning I went Staggering through premonitions of my death I don't see Anybody that dear to me Dear shadow, alive and well How can the body die? You tell me everything Anything true Jessie, I don't know what I have done I'm turning myself into a demon I don't know what I have done I'm turning myself to a demon
