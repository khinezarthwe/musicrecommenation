If I was a flower growing wild and freeAll I'd want is you to be my sweet honey bee.And if I was a tree growing tall and greeenAll I'd want is you to shade me and be my leavesIf I was a flower growing wild and freeAll I'd want is you to be my sweet honey bee.And if I was a tree growing tall and greenAll I'd want is you to shade me and be my leavesAll I want is you, will you be my brideTake me by the hand and stand by my sideAll I want is you, will you stay with me?Hold me in your arms and sway me like the sea.If you were a river in the mountains tall,The rumble of your water would be my call.If you were the winter, I know I'd be the snowJust as long as you were with me, let the cold winds blowAll I want is you, will you be my brideTake me by the hand and stand by my sideAll I want is you, will you stay with me?Hold me in your arms and sway me like the sea.If you were a wink, I'd be a nodIf you were a seed, well I'd be a pod.If you were the floor, I'd wanna be the rugAnd if you were a kiss, I know I'd be a hugAll I want is you, will you be my brideTake me by the hand and stand by my sideAll I want is you, will you stay with me?Hold me in your arms and sway me like the sea.If you were the wood, I'd be the fire.If you were the love, I'd be the desire.If you were a castle, I'd be your moat,And if you were an ocean, I'd learn to float.All I want is you, will you be my brideTake me by the hand and stand by my sideAll I want is you, will you stay with me?Hold me in your arms and sway me like the sea.
