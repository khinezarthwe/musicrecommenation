I feel it all, I feel it allI feel it all, I feel it allThe wings are wide, the wings are wideWild card in sight, wild card in sightOh I'll be the one who'll break my heartI'll be the one to hold the gunI know more than I knew beforeI know more than I knew beforeI didn't rest, I didn't stopDid we fight or did we talk?Oh I'll be the one who'll break my heartI'll be the one to hold the gunI love you moreI love you moreI don't know what I knew beforeBut now I know I want to win the warNo one likes to take a testSometimes you know more is lessPut your weight against the doorKick-drum on the basement floorStranded in the fog of wordsLoved him like the winter birdOn my head the water poursGulf stream through the open doorFly awayFly away to what you want to makeI feel it all, I feel it allI feel it all, I feel it allThe wings are wide, the wings are wideWild card in sight, wild card in sightOh I'll be the one who'll break my heartI'll be the one who'll break my heartI'll be the one who'll break my heartI'll end it, though you started itThe truth lies (we could be together)The truth lied (And now I wonder)If lies divide (to the end, we've got to make it)Lies divide
