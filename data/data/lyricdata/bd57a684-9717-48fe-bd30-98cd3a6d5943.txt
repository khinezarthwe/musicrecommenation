When I walk beside her, I am the better manWhen I look to leave her, I always stagger back againOnce I built an ivory tower so I could worship from aboveWhen I climbed down to be set free, she took me in againThere's a big, a big hard sunBeating on the big peopleIn the big hard worldWhen she comes to greet me, she is mercy at my feetYeah, when I see her inner charm, she just throws it back at meOnce I dug an early grave to find a better landShe just smiled and laughed at me and took her blues back againThere's a big, a big hard sunBeating on the big peopleIn the big hard worldThere's a big, a big hard sunBeating on the big peopleIn the big hard worldWhen I go to cross that river, she is comfort by my sideWhen I try to understand, she just opens up her handsThere's a big, a big hard sunBeating on the big peopleIn the big hard worldOnce I stood to lose her when I saw what I had doneBound down and threw away the hours of her garden and her sunSo I tried to warn her, I turned to see her weepForty days and forty nights and it's still coming down on meThere's a big, a big hard sunBeating on the big peopleIn the big hard worldThere's a big, a big hard sunBeating on the big peopleIn the big hard worldThere's a big, a big hard sunBeating on the big peopleIn the big hard worldThere's a big, a big hard sunBeating on the big peopleIn the big hard worldThere's a big, a big hard sunBeating on the big peopleIn the big hard worldThere's a big, a big hard sunBeating on the big peopleIn the big hard worldThere's a big, a big hard sunBeating on the big peopleIn the big hard worldThere's a big, a big hard sunBeating on the big peopleIn the big hard world
