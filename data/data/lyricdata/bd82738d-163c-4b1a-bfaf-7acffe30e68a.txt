The breath of the morning, I keep forgettingThe smell of the warm summer airI live in a town where you can't smell a thingYou watch your feet for cracks in the pavementUp above aliens hoverMaking home movies for the folks back homeOf all these weird creatures who lock up their spiritsDrill holes in themselves and live for their secretsThey're all uptight, uptightUptight, uptightUptight, uptightI wish that they'd swoop down in a country laneLate at night when I'm drivingTake me on board their beautiful shipShow me the world as I'd love to see itI'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe meThey'd think that I'd finally lost it completelyI'd show them the stars and the meaning of lifeThey'd shut me awayBut I'd be all rightAll rightI'm all rightAll rightI'm just uptight, uptightUptight, uptightUptight, uptightUptight, uptightUptight
