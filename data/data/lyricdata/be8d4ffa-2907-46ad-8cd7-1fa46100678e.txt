One day, it will happenOne day, one dayIt will all come true.One day, when you're readyOne day, one dayWhen you're up to it.The atmosphereWill get lighterAnd two suns readyTo shine just for youI can feel it, I can feel it.One day, it will happenOne day, one dayIt will all make sense.One day, one dayYou will blossomOne day, one dayWhen you're ready.An aeroplaneWill curve gracefullyAround the volcanoWith the eruption that never lets you down.I can feel it, I can feel itAnd the beautifullestFireworks are burningIn the sky just for youI can feel it, I can feel itOne day, one day, one day, one dayOne day, one day, one day, one day
