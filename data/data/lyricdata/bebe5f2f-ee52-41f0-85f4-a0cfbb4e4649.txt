It began when they come took me from my homeAnd put me in Dead Row,Of which I am nearly wholly innocent, you know.And I'll say it againI am not afraid to die.I began to warm and chillTo objects and their fields,A ragged cup, a twisted mopThe face of Jesus in my soupThose sinister dinner dealsThe meal trolley's wicked wheelsA hooked bone rising from my foodAll things that are good or ungood.And the mercy seat is waitingAnd I think my head is burningAnd in a way I'm yearningTo be done with all this measuring of proof.An eye for an eyeAnd a tooth for a toothAnd anyway I told the truthAnd I'm not afraid to die.Interpret signs and catalogueA blackened tooth, a scarlet fog.The walls are bad. Black. Bottom kind.They are sick breath at my hindThey are sick breath at my hindThey are sick breath at my hindThey are sick breath gathering at my hindI hear stories from the chamberHow Christ was born into a mangerAnd like some ragged strangerDied upon the crossAnd might I say, it's so fitting in its wayHe was a carpenter by tradeOr at least that's what I'm toldLike my good handTattooed E.V.I.L. across it's brother's fistThat filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist.In Heaven His throne is made of goldThe ark of his Testament is stowedA throne from which I'm toldAll history does unfold.Down here it's made of wood and wireAnd my body is on fireAnd God is never far away.Into the mercy seat I climbMy head is shaved, my head is wiredAnd like a moth that triesTo enter the bright eyeSo I go shuffling out of lifeJust to hide in death awhileAnd anyway I never lied.My kill-hand is called E.V.I.L.Wears a wedding band that's G.O.O.D.'Tis a long-suffering shackleCollaring all that devil blood.And the mercy seat is a-burningAnd I think my head is flowingAnd in a way I'm hopingTo be done with all this weighing up of truth.An eye for an eyeAnd a tooth for a toothAnd I've got nothing left to loseAnd I'm not afraid to die.And the mercy seat is growin'And I think my head is a meltin'And in a way I'm helpin'To be done with all this twistin' of the truthAn eye for an eyeAnd a tooth for a toothAnd anyway, I saw no proofAnd nor a motive why.The mercy seat is a meltin'And I think my blood is boilin'And in a way I'm spoiling all the funWith all this consequence and truthAn eye for an eyeAnd a tooth for a toothAnd I've got nothing left to loseAnd I'm not afraid to die.Now the mercy seat is waitingAnd I think my head is burnin'And in a way I'm yearningTo be done with all this measuring of proof.An eye for an eyeAnd a tooth for a toothAnd anyway, there was no proof.And nor a motive why.And the mercy seat is waitingAnd I think my head is burningAnd in a way I'm yearningTo be done with all this measuring of proofAn eye for an eyeAnd a tooth for a toothAnd anyway, there was no proofAnd I'm not afraid to die.And the mercy seat is waitingAnd I think my head is smokin'And in a way I'm hopingTo be done with all these looks of disbelief.A eye for a eyeAnd a tooth for a toothBut anyway, I told the truthBut I'm not afraid to die.And the mercy seat is waitingAnd I think my head is burningAnd in a way I'm yearningTo be done with all this measuring of proofAn eye for an eyeAnd a tooth for a toothAnd anyway, there was no proofAnd I'm not afraid to die.And the mercy seat is waitingAnd I think my head is burningAnd in a way I'm yearningTo be done with all this measuring of proofAn eye for an eyeAnd a tooth for a toothAnd anyway, there was no proofAnd I'm not afraid to die.And the mercy seat is waitingAnd I think my head is burningAnd in a way I'm yearningTo be done with all this measuring of proofAn eye for an eyeAnd a tooth for a toothAnd anyway, there was no proofBut I'm not afraid to lie.And the mercy seat is waitingAnd I think my head is burningAnd in a way I'm yearningTo be done with all this measuring of proofAn eye for an eyeAnd a tooth for a toothAnd anyway, there was no proofBut I'm not afraid to lie.And the mercy seat is waitingAnd I think my head is burningAnd in a way I'm yearningTo be done with all this measuring of proofAn eye for an eyeAnd a tooth for a toothAnd anyway, there was no proofAnd I'm afraid I told a lie.
