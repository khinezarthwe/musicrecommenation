It's 6 am Christmas morningNo shadowsNo reflections hereLying cheek to cheek in your cold embraceSo soft and so tragicAs a slaughterhouseYou press the knife against your heartAnd say that:"I love you...so much, you must kill me now."I love you...so much, you must kill me nowIf I was your vampireSoon as the moonInstead of killing timeWe'd have each other 'til the sunIf I was your vampireDeath waits for no oneHold my hands across your faceBecause I think our time has comeTaking your smile apartWith my spade tongueAnd the hole is where the heart isWe built this tomb togetherI will fill it aloneBeyond the paleEverything's black, no turning backIf I was your vampireSoon as the moonInstead of killing timeWe'd have each other 'til the sunIf I was your vampireDeath waits for no oneHold my hands across your faceBecause I think our time has comeBloodstained sheetsIn the shape of your heartThis is where it startsBloodstained sheetsIn the shape of your heartThis is where it startsThis is where it will endHere comes the moon...again6: 19 And I know I'm readyDrive me off the mountainYou'll burn and I'll eat your ashesIt's possible we're seducing your corpseIf I was your vampireSoon as the moonInstead of killing timeWe'd have each other till the sunIf I was your vampireDeath waits for no oneHold my hands across your faceBecause I think our time has comeBeyond the paleEverything's black, no turning backBeyond the paleEverything's black, no turning backThis is where it startsThis is where it will endHere comes the moon againHere comes the moon againThis is where it startsThis is where it will endHere comes the moon againHere comes the moon againHere comes the moon againHere comes the moon again
