I'm a color reporter (rose city on the 409)But the city's been bled white (white city on the yellow line)And the doctor orders (drinking 'til he's trashed is just a waste of time)He drinks all night to take away this curseBut it makes me feel much worse. Bled whiteSo I wait for the F train (white city on the yellow line)And connect through a friend of mine (white city to a friend of mine)To a yesterdaydream (yesterday a dream was just a waste of time)'Cause I'll have to be high to track the sunset downAnd paint this paling town. Bled whiteSo here he comes with a blank expression, especially for me 'cause he knows I feel the same'Cause happy and sad come in quick succession. I'm never going to become what you becameDon't you dare disturb me (don't complicate my peace of mind)While I'm balancing my past (don't complicate my peace of mind)'Cause you can't help but hurt me (being mean was just a waste of time)Like it already hasI may not seem quite right, but I'm not fucked, not quite.
