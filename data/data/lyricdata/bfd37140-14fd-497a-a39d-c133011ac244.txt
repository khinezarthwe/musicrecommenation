Love is a burning thingAnd it makes a fiery ringBound by wild desireI fell into a ring of fireI fell into a burning ring of fireI went down, down, down as the flames went higherAnd it burns, burns, burnsThe ring of fire, the ring of fireThe taste of love is sweetWhen hearts like ours meetI fell for you like a childOh, but the fire went wildI fell into a burning ring of fireI went down, down, down as the flames went higherAnd it burns, burns, burnsThe ring of fire, the ring of fireI fell into a burning ring of fireI went down, down, down as the flames went higherAnd it burns, burns, burnsThe ring of fire, the ring of fireAnd it burns, burns, burnsThe ring of fire, the ring of fireThe ring of fire, the ring of fire
