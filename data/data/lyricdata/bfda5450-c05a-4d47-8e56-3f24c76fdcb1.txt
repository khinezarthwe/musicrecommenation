I was dreaming of the pastWhy do good times never lastHelp me Jesus, show the wayI can't hold on another dayI was hungry, felling lowI just couldn't make out which way to goChasing rainbows that have no endThe road is long without friendBe my friend, be my brotherBe the piper, play the callAcross the seven seas of wonderBe the guardian of my soulJust a young man looking homewardWatching the sun go down againAcross the water the sun is shiningBut will it ever, will it ever be the sameBe my friend, be my brotherBe the piper, play the callAcross the seven seas of wonderBe the guardian of my soulI need somebody, I need someoneI need somebody to call my ownLike a blindman I can feel the heat of the sunBut like a blindman I don't know, I don't know, I don't know where it's coming fromBe my friend, be my brotherBe the piper, play the callAcross the seven seas of wonderBe the guardian of my soulI need somebody, I need someoneI need somebody to call my ownLike a blindman I can feel the heat of the sunBut like a blindman I don't know, I don't know, I don't know where it's coming from
