Don't light me up I got a short fuseDon't put me down I just love the dirtDon't tie me up cause I'll just get looseDon't try to play you might get hurtThe violence in Europe is oozingJust like the pus from a broken scabGot made a man from nights of boozingGonna be just like my DadHey Mr. Postman what's the news todayCan you tell me if everything's gonna be okayMy eyes are wide open and the drapes have been drawnMy mind is smoking, blowing up like an atom bombDon't light me up I got a short fuseDon't put me down I just love the dirtDon't tie me up cause I'll just get looseDon't try to play you might get hurtThe dogs are gone and I can't get workThe sun shines down like a 40-watt bulbI told my mom and she went berserkShould have done what I been toldHey Humpty Dumpty I guess you learned your lessonYou got made into breakfast by some fat old TexanAnd all the king's horses and all the king's menCouldn't find a reason, and pushed Humpty to his endDon't light me up I got a short fuseDon't put me down I just love the dirtDon't tie me up cause I'll just get looseDon't try to play you might get hurt
