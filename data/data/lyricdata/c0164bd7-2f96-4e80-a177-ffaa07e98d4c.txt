Don't light me up I got a short fuse Don't put me down I just love the dirt Don't tie me up cause I'll just get loose Don't try to play you might get hurt The violence in Europe is oozing Just like the pus from a broken scab Got made a man from nights of boozing Gonna be just like my Dad Hey Mr. Postman what's the news today Can you tell me if everything's gonna be okay My eyes are wide open and the drapes have been drawn My mind is smoking, blowing up like an atom bomb Don't light me up I got a short fuse Don't put me down I just love the dirt Don't tie me up cause I'll just get loose Don't try to play you might get hurt The dogs are gone and I can't get work The sun shines down like a 40-watt bulb I told my mom and she went berserk Should have done what I been told Hey Humpty Dumpty I guess you learned your lesson You got made into breakfast by some fat old Texan And all the king's horses and all the king's men Couldn't find a reason, and pushed Humpty to his end Don't light me up I got a short fuse Don't put me down I just love the dirt Don't tie me up cause I'll just get loose Don't try to play you might get hurt
