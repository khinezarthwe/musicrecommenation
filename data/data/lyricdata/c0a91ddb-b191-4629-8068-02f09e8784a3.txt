Don't feel like homeHe's a little outAnd all these words aloneIs nothing like your poemPutting in, inputting inDon't feel like methadoneA scratching voice all aloneIt's nothing like your baritoneIt's nothing as it seemsThe little that he needs, it's homeThe little that he seesIs nothing he can seize, it's homeOne uninviting chromosomeA blanket like the ozoneIt's nothing as it seemsAll that he needs is homeThe little that he freesIs nothing he believesSaving it for a sunny daySomething maybe, two toneAnything of his ownA chip off the corner stoneWho's kidding? Rainy dayA one way ticket headstoneAn occupation's overthrownA whisper through a megaphoneIt's nothing as it seemsThe little that he needs, it's homeThe little that he seesIs nothing he concedes, it's homeAnd all that he freesA little bittersweet, it's homeIt's nothing as it seemsThe little that he sees, it's home
