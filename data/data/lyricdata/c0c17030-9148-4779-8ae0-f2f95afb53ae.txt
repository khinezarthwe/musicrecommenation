This is not my fight! This is something more!life! Revolution Convolution Expectation Desperation Holed up, scarred and tamed for the hell of it Look at me; I am the glorified malcontent Save me? Save this! All I gotta do is give up and all is forgiven!

This is not my fight! This is something more! This is not my life!
