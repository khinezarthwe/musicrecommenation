Save this!All I gotta do is give up and all is forgiven!I'm sick of being the butt of the cosmic jokeAnd I don't get the punch lineA million people lined up for milesTo see the great big mouth, shut up and apologize!This is not my war!This is not my fight!This is something more!This is not my life!RevolutionConvolutionOnly reason to question whyToday, I saidI'm the pariahI am the liarI can take anythingAccuse me of everythingCut off the systemDeny my existenceI won't be afraidI won't be unmadeSo come on; Break it off!Come on; Buy the lie!Come on; Say it, say it!Come on! Say goodbye!, One, Two, Three
