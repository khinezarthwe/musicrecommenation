It's bugging meGrating meAnd twisting me aroundYeah I'm endlesslyCaving inAnd turning inside out'Cause I want it nowI want it nowGive me your heart and your soulAnd I'm breaking outI'm breaking outLast chance to lose controlYeah, it's holding meMorphing meAnd forcing me to striveTo be endlesslyCold withinAnd dreaming I'm alive'Cause I want it nowI want it nowGive me your heart and your soulI'm not breaking downI'm breaking outLast chance to lose controlAnd I want you nowI want you nowI'll feel my heart implodeAnd I'm breaking outEscaping nowFeeling my faith erode
