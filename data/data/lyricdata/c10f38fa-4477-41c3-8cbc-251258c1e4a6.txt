The caves of our mouths are forest darkness And the air in between is overflowing And the rushing wolverine flies past His shiny, shiny teeth And she is kind, he is free, full of knowing She is sure She is sure The caves of our mouths are bear's bellies And the air in between is spewing comets And the dancing centaur queen flies past Her tiny, tiny teeth He is kind, she is free, and wants to show him Find him in the bat's mouth He is singing in her bat's mouth He is shaking and dancing in her bat mouth Getting tired and sleepy in her bat mouth And she's holding him tight in her bat arms She is wrapping him up in her bat arms And she's thanking her mother sea" Thank you mother sea for letting him see the sea in me"
