The caves of our mouths are forest darknessAnd the air in between is overflowingAnd the rushing wolverine flies pastHis shiny, shiny teethAnd she is kind, he is free, full of knowingShe is sureShe is sureThe caves of our mouths are bear's belliesAnd the air in between is spewing cometsAnd the dancing centaur queen flies pastHer tiny, tiny teethHe is kind, she is free, and wants to show himFind him in the bat's mouthHe is singing in her bat's mouthHe is shaking and dancing in her bat mouthGetting tired and sleepy in her bat mouthAnd she's holding him tight in her bat armsShe is wrapping him up in her bat armsAnd she's thanking her mother sea"Thank you mother sea for letting him see the sea in me"
