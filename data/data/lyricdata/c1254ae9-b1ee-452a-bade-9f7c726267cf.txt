Thinking outrageously, I write in cursiveI hide in my bed with the lights on the floorWearing three layers of coats and leg warmersI see my own breath on the face of the doorOh, I am not quite sleepingOh, I am fast in bedThere on the wall in the bedroom creepingI see a wasp with her wings outstretchedNorth of Savanna we swim in the PalisadesI come out wearing my brother's red hatThere on his shoulder, my best friend is bit seven timesHe runs washing his face in his handsOh, how I meant to tease himOh, how I meant no harmTouching his back with my hand, I kiss himI see the wasp on the length of my armOh great sights upon this state, halleluWonders bright and rivers, lake, halleluTrail of Tears and Horseshoe Lake, hallelu (We were in love, we were in love, Palisades, Palisades, I can wait, I can wait)Trusting things beyond mistake, hallelu (We were in love, we were in love, Palisades, Palisades, I can wait, I can wait)We were in love, we were in lovePalisades, Palisades, I can wait, I can waitLamb of God, we sound the horn, hallelujah (We were in love, we were in love, Palisades, Palisades, I can wait, I can wait)To us, your ghost is born, hallelu (We were in love, we were in love, Palisades, Palisades, I can wait, I can wait)I can't explain the state that I'm inThe state of my heart, he was my best friendInto the car, from the backseatOh admiration in falling asleepAll of my powers, day after dayI can tell you, we swaggered and swayedDeep in the tower, the prairies belowI can tell you, the telling gets oldTerrible sting and terrible stormI can tell you the day we were bornMy friend is gone, he ran awayI can tell you, I love him each dayThough we have sparred, wrestled, and ragedI can tell you I love him each dayTerrible sting, terrible stormI can tell you
