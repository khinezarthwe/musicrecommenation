Oh my Mama She gave me these feathered breaths Oh my Mama She told me use your voice, My little bird She said sing sing sing sing sing sing melodies And she sang sang sang sang sang sang melodies Oh my Mama She did give me fancy feet I'll be dancing on And I'll tap tap tap my toes Into those creaking floorboards Oh my Mama She took my little hand and held on tight Oh the Mamas Give the waters of their wells Oh the Mamas Give the babies this very dirt we're walking on Oh my Mama She gave me these feathered breaths And your Mama She gave you those feathered breaths too And when the sky drops all those feathers And when the birds sing in the morning I'll be a mama I'll have a daughter I'll be a mama I'll have a daughter And I'll give her melodies I'll give her melodies And I'll give her melodies I'll give her melodies And she'll be My little bird And then she'll fly She'll fly
