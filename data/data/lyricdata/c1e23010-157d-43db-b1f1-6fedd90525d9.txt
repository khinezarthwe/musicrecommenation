This is the first day of my lifeSwear I was born right in the doorwayI went out in the rain, suddenly everything changedThey're spreading blankets on the beachYours is the first face that I sawI think I was blind before I met youAnd I don't know where I am, I don't know where I've beenBut I know where I want to goAnd so I thought I'd let you knowThat these things take forever, I especially am slowBut I realized that I need youAnd I wondered if I could come homeRemember the time you drove all nightJust to meet me in the morningAnd I thought it was strange, you said everything changedYou felt as if you'd just woke upAnd you said, "This is the first day of my lifeI'm glad I didn't die before I met youBut now I don't care, I could go anywhere with youAnd I'd probably be happy"So if you wanna be with meWith these things there's no telling, we'll just have to wait and seeBut I'd rather be working for a paycheckThan waiting to win the lotteryBesides maybe this time it's differentI mean, I really think you like me, me, me, me
