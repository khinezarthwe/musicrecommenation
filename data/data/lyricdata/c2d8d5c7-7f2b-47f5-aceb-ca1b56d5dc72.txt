My cold, cold sailor heart says, "Get on your way"I ain't too proud to say that that's how I'm madeI'll be that person till my dying dayI try so awful hard but I can't changeFrom runways to the road, I ramble aloneThis thumbnail size of heart is black as coalYour beauty, it still bring me to my kneesDon't waste a tear on me, it's my diseaseDon't leave no smell on meDon't leave no smell on meI'll blow off in your sleepDon't leave no smell on meThose preppy boys in blue, they're making fun of usSo we take it to the street 'cause we're an ornery curseBut we're not here to make your children bleedWe're here to cover ground with a tumbleweedDon't leave no smell on meDon't leave no smell on meI'll blow off in your sleepDon't leave no smell on meDon't take these boots off me when you think that I'm deadI'll still be running from the demon in my headI'll be that person till my dying dayI try so awful hard but I can't changeDon't leave no smell on meDon't leave no smell on meI'll blow off in your sleepDon't leave no smell on me
