My cold, cold sailor heart says, " Get on your way" I ain't too proud to say that that's how I'm made I'll be that person till my dying day I try so awful hard but I can't change From runways to the road, I ramble alone This thumbnail size of heart is black as coal Your beauty, it still bring me to my knees Don't waste a tear on me, it's my disease Don't leave no smell on me Don't leave no smell on me I'll blow off in your sleep Don't leave no smell on me Those preppy boys in blue, they're making fun of us So we take it to the street 'cause we're an ornery curse But we're not here to make your children bleed We're here to cover ground with a tumbleweed Don't leave no smell on me Don't leave no smell on me I'll blow off in your sleep Don't leave no smell on me Don't take these boots off me when you think that I'm dead I'll still be running from the demon in my head I'll be that person till my dying day I try so awful hard but I can't change Don't leave no smell on me Don't leave no smell on me I'll blow off in your sleep Don't leave no smell on me
