In the shadows of the dark night You need a woman by your side She'll help you make it in the cold light And keep you warm and satisfied If you want some more loving Drive you out of your mind Give a little sweetness and sugar Just make it sure she understands White skin women keep me howling for more Brown skin honey I love Got a whitesnake mama You want to shake it mama Got a whitesnake mama Come and let it crawl on you Just enough to see you through You want to find a little angel Sweet surrender in her eyes Broke down heart through morning To the moon is on the rise Night time is the right time For rolling on the silent gloves Day time, night time, any time is the right time Stealing round and making some love White skin women keep me howling for more Brown skin honey I love Got a whitesnake mama You want to shake it mama Got a whitesnake mama Come and let it crawl on you Just enough to see you through Listen Back door man ain't done nothingbut creep around the door When you see his woman weeping You know the snake is there for more Day time, night time is the right time For rolling on the silent gloves Night time is the right time Make it sure you're the only one White skin women keep me howling for more Brown skin honey I love Got a whitesnake mama You want to shake it mama Got a whitesnake mama Come and let it crawl on you And you, and you Got a whitesnake mama
