When I'm at the pearly gatesThis'll be on my videotape, my videotapeMephistopheles is just beneathAnd he's reaching up to grab meThis is one for the good daysAnd I have it all hereIn red, blue, greenRed, blue, greenYou are my centerWhen I spin awayOut of control on videotapeOn videotapeOn videotapeOn videotapeOn videotapeThis is my way of saying goodbye'Cause I can't do it face to faceI'm talking to you beforeNo matter what happens nowYou shouldn't be afraidBecause I know today has beenThe most perfect day I've ever seen
