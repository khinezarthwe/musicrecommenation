I can't feel my sensesI just feel the coldAll colors seem to fade awayI can't reach my soulI would stop running, if I knew there was a chanceIt tears me apart to sacrifice it all, but I'm forced to let goTell me I'm frozen, but what can I do?Can't tell the reasons I did it for youWhen lies turn into truth I sacrificed for youYou say that I'm frozen, but what can I do?I can feel your sorrowYou won't forgive me,But I know you'll be all rightIt tears me apart that you will never know, but I have to let goTell me I'm frozen, but what can I do?Can't tell the reasons I did it for youWhen lies turn into truth I sacrificed for youYou say that I'm frozen, but what can I do?Everything will slip awayShattered pieces will remainWhen memories fade into emptinessOnly time will tell its taleIf it all has been in vainI can't feel my sensesI just feel the coldFrozen...But what can I do?Frozen...Tell me I'm frozen but what can I do?Can't tell the reasons I did it for youWhen lies turn into truth I sacrificed for youYou say that I'm frozen, frozen...
