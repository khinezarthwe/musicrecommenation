Memories consume like opening the woundsI'm picking me apart againYou all assume I'm safe here in my roomUnless I try to start againI don't want to be the one the battles always choose'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confusedI don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to screamI don't know why I instigate and say what I don't meanI don't know how I got this way; I know it's not alrightSo I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaking the habit tonightClutching my cure, I tightly lock the doorI try to catch my breath againI hurt much more than anytime beforeI had no options left againI don't want to be the one the battles always choose'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confusedI don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to screamI don't know why I instigate and say what I don't meanI don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alrightSo I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaking the habit tonightI'll paint it on the walls'Cause I'm the one at faultI'll never fight againAnd this is how it endsI don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to screamBut now I have some clarity to show you what I meanI don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alrightSo, I'm breaking the habit, I'm breaking the habitI'm breaking the habit tonight
