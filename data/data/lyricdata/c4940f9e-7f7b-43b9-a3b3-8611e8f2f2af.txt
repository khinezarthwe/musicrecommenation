The days grow shorter and the nights are getting longFeels like we're running out of timeEvery day it seems much harder tellin' right from wrongYou got to read between the linesDon't get discouraged, don't be afraid, we canMake it through another dayMake it worth the price we payThe Good Book says it's better to give than to receiveI do my best to do my partNothin' in my pockets I got nothin' up my sleeveI keep my magic in my heartKeep up your spirit, keep up your faith, babyI am counting on youYou know what you've got to doFight the good fight every momentEvery minute every dayFight the good fight every momentIt's your only wayAll your life you've been waiting for your chanceWhere you'll fit into the planBut you're the master of your own destinySo give and take the best that you canYou think a little more money will buy your soul some restYou'd better think of something else insteadYou're so afraid of being honest with yourselfYou'd better take a look inside your headNothing is easy, nothing good is freeBut I can tell you where to startTake a look inside your heartThere's an answer in your heartFight the good fight every momentEvery minute every dayFight the good fight every momentMake it worth the price we payEvery moment of your lifetimeEvery minute every dayFight the good fight every momentMake it worth the price we pay
