Does it burn?Is it painful to learn that it's me that has all the control?Does it thrill? Does it sting?When you feel what I bring and you wish that you had me to holdWhen it gets cold outside and you got nobody to loveYou'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up (Yeah, yeah, yeah)And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreamsSay, is there anyone out there?'Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breatheIs there anyone out there?'Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breatheIs there anyone out there?'Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
