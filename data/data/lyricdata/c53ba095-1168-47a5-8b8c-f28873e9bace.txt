(I'm over you, I'm over you)(I'm over you, I'm over you)I join the queue on your answer phoneAnd all I am is holding breathJust pick up, I know you're thereCan't you hear? I'm not myselfOh, go ahead and lie to meYou could say anythingSmall talk will be just fineYour voice is everythingWe owe it to loveAnd it all depends on youSo listen up, this sun hasn't setI refuse to believe that it's only me feelingJust hear me out; I'm not over you yetIt's love on the line, can you handle it?So how do I do normal?The smile I fake, the permanent waveOf cue cards and fix-it kitsCan't you tell? I'm not myselfI'm a slow motion accidentLost in coffee rings and fingerprintsI don't wanna feel anything but I doAnd it all comes back to youSo listen up, this sun hasn't setI refuse to believe that it's only me feelingJust hear me out; I'm not over you yetIt's love on the line, can you handle it?So listen up, you've got me strainedJust hear me out, don't make me waitI'm not myself, I can't take thisLove's on the line, is that your final answer?I join the queue on your answer phoneAnd all I am is holding breathJust pick up, I know you're thereSo listen up, this sun hasn't setI refuse to believe that it's only me feelingJust hear me out; I'm not over you yetIt's love on the line, can you handle it?So listen up, this sun hasn't setI refuse to believe that it's only me feelingJust hear me out; I'm not over youIt's love on the line, can you handle it?So listen up, this sun hasn't setI refuse to believe that it's only me feelingJust hear me out I'm not over you yetIt's love on the line
