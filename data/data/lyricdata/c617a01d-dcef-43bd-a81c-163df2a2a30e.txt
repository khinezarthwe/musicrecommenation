When I was surrounded by the world You were the only one who came And you were the only one astounded which kept me grounded As the other girls thrashed my very name Then I looked over just in time To see her smiling back at me and saying Your blue veins Yeah, and the feeling that you gave me No matter what I do or where I go, it always will remain And those who would enslave me to get to me Must get past you and will have no luck' Cause you'll protect me from all pain It's true, you know what You're the most beautiful Yeah, the most beautiful thing' Cause anything else can't compare It must be the blood that's running through your blue veins Your blue veins Your blue veins And I know you won't deceive me like the rest And there's nothing you need to explain You always the first one to believe me When I say to you, girl, But I could be wrong Yeah, but all of these things, all these things They're all truly nice but ain't nothing Ain't nothing compared to the love That's running through your little blue veins Your blue veins
