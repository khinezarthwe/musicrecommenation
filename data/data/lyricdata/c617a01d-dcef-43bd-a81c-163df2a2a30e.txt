When I was surrounded by the worldYou were the only one who cameAnd you were the only one astounded which kept me groundedAs the other girls thrashed my very nameThen I looked over just in timeTo see her smiling back at me and sayingYour blue veinsYeah, and the feeling that you gave meNo matter what I do or where I go, it always will remainAnd those who would enslave me to get to meMust get past you and will have no luck'Cause you'll protect me from all painIt's true, you know whatYou're the most beautifulYeah, the most beautiful thing'Cause anything else can't compareIt must be the blood that's running through your blue veinsYour blue veinsYour blue veinsAnd I know you won't deceive me like the restAnd there's nothing you need to explainYou always the first one to believe meWhen I say to you, girl,But I could be wrongYeah, but all of these things, all these thingsThey're all truly nice but ain't nothingAin't nothing compared to the loveThat's running through your little blue veinsYour blue veins
