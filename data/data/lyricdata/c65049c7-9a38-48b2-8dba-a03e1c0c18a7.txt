I, I came here by day,But I left here in darknessAnd found you, found you on the way.But now, it is silver and silent.It is silver and cold.You in somber resplendence,I hold...Your sins into me,Oh, my beautiful one.Your sins into me.As a rapturous voice escapesI will tremble a prayerand I'll beg for forgiveness.Your sins into me,Your sins into meOh, my beautiful one.Light, like the flutter of wings,Feel your hollow voice rushingInto me as you're longing to sing.So I, I will paint you in silver.I will wrap you in cold.I will lift up your voice as I sink.Your sins into me,Oh, my beautiful one, nowYour sins into me.As a rapturous voice escapesI will tremble a prayerAnd I'll beg for forgiveness.Your sins into me,Your sins into meCold in life's throes.I'll fall asleep for you.Cold in life's throes.I only ask you turn away.Cold in life's throes.I'll fall asleep for you.Cold in life's throesI only ask you turnAs you seep into me,Oh, my beautiful one, now...Your sins into me,Oh, my beautiful one.Your sins into me.As a rapturous voice escapesI will tremble a prayerAnd I'll beg for forgiveness.Your sins into me,Your sins into meYour sins into me,Oh, my beautiful one, nowYour sins into me.As a rapturous voice escapesI will tremble a prayerAnd I'll beg for forgiveness.Your sins into me,Your sins into...Your sins into meYour sins into me,Oh my beautiful one!
