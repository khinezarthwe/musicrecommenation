I've been outside Invited in But I couldn't abide Wouldn't miss it again Burning every bridge that I cross To find some beautiful place to get lost I had true love I made it die I pushed her away She said, "please stay" Burning every bridge that I cross To find some beautiful place to get lost To find some beautiful place to get lost Oooh ooh I don't know where I'll go now And I don't really care who follows me there But I'll burn every bridge that I cross To find some beautiful place to get lost To find some beautiful place to get lost Oooh ooh Oooh ooh Oooh ooh Oooh ooh Oooh ooh Oooh ooh
