Standing on the shoreWaiting for the ship in callThere's something in the way I move that keeps them on their ownThe stars explodes a stormA billion seasons bornA shock to the waves I know, breaking far from shoreDon't want to talkAll I hear is noiseDon't want to talkThe future's in my handsI hold it in my palmsEngrave it the leylines running right down her armsSpeak in silent tonguesLies reflect the timesThe ghosts and the shadows fill the living sceneDon't want to talkAll I hear is noiseDon't want to talk
