Who's to sayWhat's impossibleWell they forgotThis world keeps spinningAnd with each new dayI can feel a change in everythingAnd as the surface breaks reflections fadeBut in some ways they remain the sameAnd as my mind begins to spread its wingsThere's no stopping curiosityI want to turn the whole thing upside downI'll find the things they say just can't be foundI'll share this love I find with everyoneWe'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songsI don't want this feeling to go awayWho's to sayI can't do everythingWell I can tryAnd as I roll along I begin to findThings aren't always just what they seemI want to turn the whole thing upside downI'll find the things they say just can't be foundI'll share this love I find with everyoneWe'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songsThis world keeps spinning and there's no time to wasteWell it all keeps spinning spinning round and round andUpside downWho's to say what's impossible and can't be foundI don't want this feeling to go awayPlease don't go awayPlease don't go awayPlease don't go awayIs this how it's supposed to beIs this how it's supposed to be
