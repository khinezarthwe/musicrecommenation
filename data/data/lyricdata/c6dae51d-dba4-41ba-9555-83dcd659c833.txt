Can we call it a day? Now would that be okay? Can we just go our own separate ways?' Cause I'm cold and I'm wet And I'm willing to bet That you constructed this maze Well, I stumble around Try to follow the sound Then something takes hold of my hand It becomes such a mess And I'd venture to guess That you concocted this plan I don't know what to do' Cause it's always been you Who helps me to make up my mind But I'll stake my life And I'll swear by this knife That it's all by your design Enough has been said It goes round in my head Until I break down and cry I wouldn't be surprised If that look in your eyes Was your way of saying goodbye Can we call it a day? Now would that be okay? Can we just go our own separate ways?' Cause I'm cold and I'm wet And I'm willing to bet That you constructed this maze You concocted this plan I don't know what to do' Cause it's always been you Who helps me to make up my mind But I'll stake my life And I'll swear by this knife That it's all by your design Yeah, it's all by your design
