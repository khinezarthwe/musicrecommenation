Oh the werewolf, the werewolfComes stepping alongHe don't even break the branches where he's goneOnce I saw him in the moonlight, when the bats were flyingI saw the werewolf, and the werewolf was cryingHow nobody knows, nobody knows, body knowsHow I loved the man, as I teared off his clothes.How nobody knows, nobody knows my painWhen I see that it's risen; that full moon againFor the werewolf, the werewolf has seen apathyFor the werewolf, somebody like you and me.And only he goes to me, man this little flute I play.All through the night, until the light of day, and we are doomed to play.For the werewolf, the werewolf, has seen apathyFor the werewolf, somebody like you and me.
