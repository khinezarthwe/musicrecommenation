I am the key to the lock in your houseThat keeps your toys in the basementAnd if you get too far insideYou'll only see my reflectionIt's always best when the colour is offI am the pick in the iceDo not cry out or hit the alarmYou know we're friends till we dieAnd either way you turn, I'll be thereOpen up your skull, I'll be thereClimbing up the wallsIt's always best when the light is offIt's always better on the outsideFifteen blows to the back of my headFifteen blows to your mindSo lock the kids up safe tonightAnd shut the eyes in the cupboardI've got the smell of a local manWho's got the loneliest feelingAnd either way you turn, I'll be thereOpen up your skull, I'll be thereClimbing up the wallsClimbing up the wallsClimbing up the walls
