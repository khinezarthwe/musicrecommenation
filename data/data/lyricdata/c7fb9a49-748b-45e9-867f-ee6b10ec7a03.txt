I'm gonna take it to the limit of my loveBefore I turn and walk awayI've had enough of holding onThe promises of yesterdayEvery day of my life, it seemsTrouble's knocking at my doorIt's hard to try and satisfyWhen you don't know what you're fighting forTime and again I sing your songBut I've been runnin' on empty far too longI've had enough holdin' on to the pastMake no mistake, it could be your lastDon't break my heart againLike you did beforeDon't break my heart againI couldn't take anymoreI never hide the feeling insideAnd though I'm standing my back to the wallI know that even in a summer loveA little bit of rain must fallBut every road I take I knowWhere it's gonna lead me toBecause I've travelled every highwayAnd they all keep coming back to youTime and again I sing your songBut I've been runnin' on empty far too longI've had enough holdin' on to the pastMake no mistake, it could be your lastDon't break my heart againLike you did beforeDon't break my heart againI couldn't take anymoreDon't break my heartDon't break my heart againLike you did beforeDon't break my heart againI couldn't take anymoreDon't break my heart againLike you did beforeDon't break my heart againI couldn't take anymore
