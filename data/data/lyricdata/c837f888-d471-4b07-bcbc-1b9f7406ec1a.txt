I don't want to hurt youFor no reason have I but fearAnd I ain't guiltyOf the crimes you accuse me ofBut I'm guilty of fearI'm sorry to remindYou but I'm scaredOf what we're creatingThis life ain't fairYou don't get something for nothing, turn nowGotta try a little harderIt could be sweetLike a long forgotten dreamAnd we don't need themTo cast the fate we haveLove don't always shine through'cause I don't wanna loseWhat we had last timeYou're leavingThis life ain't fairYou don't get something for nothing, turn nowGotta try a little harderIt could be sweetBut the thoughts we try to denyTake a toll upon our livesWe struggle on in depths of prideTangled up in single minds'cause I don't wanna loseWhat we had last timeYou're leavingThis life ain't fairYou don't get something for nothing, turn backGotta try a little harder'cause I don't wanna loseWhat we had last time your leavingThis life ain't fairYou don't get something for nothing, turn backGotta try a little harderIt could be sweet
