I hear the tiniest sparks and the tenderest soundsDiving musicDrowning the soundWaltzing with the hairs upon my armsThen your fight or flight alarmAnd you trembleThen you stumbleAnd you scrape up your palmsI can't stay here to hold your handI've been away for so longI've lost my taste for homeAnd that's a dirty, fallow feeling...To be the dangling ceilingFrom when the roof came crashing downPeeling in the heatVanish in the rainThe next time you say "forever"I will punch you in your faceJust because you don't believe itDoesn't mean I didn't mean itYou never knew when I'll show you the neverYou never know when I'll show you the never
