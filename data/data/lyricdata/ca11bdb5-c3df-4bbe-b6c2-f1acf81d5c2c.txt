Someday my painSomeday my pain will mark youHarness your blameHarness your blame and walk throughWith the wild wolves around youIn the morning, I'll call youSend it farther onSolace my gameSolace my game, it stars youSwing wide your craneSwing wide your crane and run me throughAnd the story's all over youIn the morning I'll call youCan't you find a clueWhen your eyes are all painted Sinatra blueWhat might have been lostWhat might have been lostWhat might have been lostWhat might have been lostDon't bother meWhat might have been lostWhat might have been lostWhat might have been lostWhat might have been lostWhat might have been lostWhat might have been lostWhat might have been lostWhat might have been lostAh, ahSomeday my painSomeday my painSomeday my painSomeday my pain
