How do you How do you do How do you How do you do it Music make her stop pressing those strings firmly to my down Ground water is drying up to fill my jars again But then click clack clickity click click click Clickity clack Clickity clack I'm through having your harsh march stare down my size And punish what young is left in these eyes And how do I Oh how do I How do I How did I How can I How will I How did I How can I pick up and go' Cause I lack the wind and trees and the sunlight in the afternoon And my button collections need to find a home And that click clack clickity click click click Clickity clack Clickity clack I'm through having your harsh march stare down my size And punish what young is left in these eyes Oh click clack clickity click click click Clickity clack Clickity clack And when I turn my back And when I turn my back I'll twirl my little skirt And it'll be my shoes instead of yours My shoes instead of yours My shoes screaming back Click clack clickity click click click Clickity clack Clickity clack
