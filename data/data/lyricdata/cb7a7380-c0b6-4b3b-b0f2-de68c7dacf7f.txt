Round like a circle in a spiralLike a wheel within a wheelNever ending or beginningOn an ever-spinning reelLike a snowball down a mountainOr a carnival balloonLike a carousel that's turningRunning rings around the moonLike a clock whose hands are sweepingPast the minutes on its faceAnd the world is like an appleWhirling silently in spaceLike the circles that you findIn the windmills of your mindLike a tunnel that you followTo a tunnel of its ownDown a hollow to a cavernWhere the sun has never shoneLike a door that keeps revolvingIn a half-forgotten dreamLike the ripples from a pebbleSomeone tosses in a streamLike a clock whose hands are sweepingPast the minutes on its faceAnd the world is like an appleWhirling silently in spaceLike the circles that you findIn the windmills of your mindKeys that jingle in your pocketWords that jangle in your headWhy did summer go so quickly?Was it something that you said?Lovers walk along the shoreAnd leave their footprints in the sandWas the sound of distant drummingJust the fingers of your handPictures hanging in a hallwayAnd the fragment of a songHalf-remembered names and facesBut to whom do they belongWhen you knew that it was overWere you suddenly awareThat the autumn leaves were turningTo the color of her hairLike a circle in a spiralLike a wheel within a wheelNever ending or beginningOn an ever-spinning reelAs the images unwindLike the circles that you findIn the windmills of your mind
