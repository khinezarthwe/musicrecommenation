As I walk along, I wonderA-what went wrong with our loveA love that was so strongAnd as I still walk on, I think ofThe things we've done togetherWhile our hearts were youngI'm a-walkin' in the rainTears are fallin' and I feel the painWishin' you were here by meTo end this miseryI wonderI wah-wah-wah-wah-wonderWhyWhy, why, why, why, whyShe ran awayAnd I wonderWhere she will stayMy little runawayA-run, run, run, run, runawayI'm a-walkin' in the rainTears are fallin' and I feel the painWishin' you were here by meTo end this miseryAnd I wonderI wah-wah-wah-wah-wonderWhyWhy, why, why, why, whyShe ran awayAnd I wonderWhere she will stayMy little runawayA-run, run, run, run, runawayA-run, run, run, run, runawayA-run, run, run, run, runaway
