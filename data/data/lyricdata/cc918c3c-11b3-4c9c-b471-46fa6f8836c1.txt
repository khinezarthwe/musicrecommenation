Faceless fall from this life and ah, if you can'tSee the star, probably gone too farLike the voice that cried on the lonesome tideLike the wave was the only love it ever sawAsks the stork that soarsWith the owl, high aboveCanyons mighty wallsOwl said,Turn from the fear of the storms that might beOh, let it free, that caged on fire thingOh, hold its hands, it'll feel like lightningOh, in your arms safe from the stormsSky bends, the moon's dress' slung low, slung lowDog star taught a danceIt goes, goes, goes, goes, goes, goes, goesArms out, knees bend, the motion flowsLike the soft, open petals of a Jessica RoseSo seriousSo it falls apartIt just reveals the perfect nothingOf everything you are, everything we areCandle of life lights the blights and bruisesOh, lay it down in the night, let it soothe thisOh, hold its hands and we'll know what truth isOh, in its arms safe from the storms
