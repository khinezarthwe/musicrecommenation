Turnstiles on mezzanineJet ways and Dramamine fiendsAnd x-ray machinesYou were hurling through spaceG-forces twisting your faceBreeding superstitionA fatal premonitionYou know you got to envisionThe fiery crashOh close your eyes and you wake upFace stuck to a vinyl setteeOh the line was starting to break upJust as you were starting to saySomething apropos I don't knowBeige tiles and magazinesLou Dobbs and the CNN teamOn every monitor screenYou were caught in the crossfireWhere every human faceHas you reaching for your maceSo it's kind of an impositionFatal premonitionTo save our lives you've got to envisionAnd to save all our lives you've got to envisionThe fiery crashIt's just a formalityWhy must I explain?Just a nod to mortalityBefore you get on a planeOh close your eyes and you wake upFace stuck to a vinyl setteeOh the line was starting to break upWhat was that you were going to say?
