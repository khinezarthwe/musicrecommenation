Everybody knows which way you go, straight to overNo one wants to see you inside of me, straight to overI heard the hammer at the lockSay you're deaf and dumb and doneGive yourself another talkThis time make it sound like someoneThe noise is coming out and if it's not out nowThen tomorrow, tomorrowThey took your life apart and called your failures artThey were wrong, though they won't know'Til tomorrow(AhAh)I got static in my headThe reflected sound of everythingTried to go to where it ledBut it didn't lead to anythingThe noise is coming outAnd if it's not out nowI know it's just about to drown tomorrow out
