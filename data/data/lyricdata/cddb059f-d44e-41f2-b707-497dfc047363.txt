The king's taken back the throne, the useless seed is sownWhen they say they're cutting off the phone, I tell 'em you're not homeNo place to hide, you were fighting as a soldier on their sideYou're still a soldier in your mind though nothing's on the lineYou say it's money that we need as if we're only mouths to feedI know no matter what you say, there are some debts you'll never payWorking for the church while your family diesYou take what they give you and you keep it insideEvery spark of friendship and love will die without a homeHear the soldier groan, "We'll go at it alone"I can taste the fear, lift me up and take me out of hereDon't wanna fight, don't wanna die, just wanna hear you cryWho's going to throw the very first stone? Oh, who's going to reset the bone?Walking with your head in a sling, want to hear the soldier singWorking for the church while my family diesYour little baby sister's gonna lose her mindEvery spark of friendship and love will die without a homeHear the soldier groan, "We'll go at it alone"I can taste your fear, it's gonna lift you up and take you out of hereAnd the bone shall never heal, I care not if you kneelWe can't find you now but they're gonna get their money back somehowAnd when you finally disappear, we'll say you were never hereBeen working for the church while your life falls apartBeen singing hallelujah with the fear in your heartEvery spark of friendship and love will die without a homeHear the soldier groan, "We'll go at it alone"Hear the soldier groan, "We'll go at it alone"
