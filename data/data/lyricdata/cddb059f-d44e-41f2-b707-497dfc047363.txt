The king's taken back the throne, the useless seed is sown When they say they're cutting off the phone, I tell 'em you're not home No place to hide, you were fighting as a soldier on their side You're still a soldier in your mind though nothing's on the line You say it's money that we need as if we're only mouths to feed I know no matter what you say, there are some debts you'll never pay Working for the church while your family dies You take what they give you and you keep it inside Every spark of friendship and love will die without a home Hear the soldier groan, " We'll go at it alone" I can taste the fear, lift me up and take me out of here Don't wanna fight, don't wanna die, just wanna hear you cry Who's going to throw the very first stone? Oh, who's going to reset the bone? Walking with your head in a sling, want to hear the soldier sing Working for the church while my family dies Your little baby sister's gonna lose her mind Every spark of friendship and love will die without a home Hear the soldier groan, " We'll go at it alone" I can taste your fear, it's gonna lift you up and take you out of here And the bone shall never heal, I care not if you kneel We can't find you now but they're gonna get their money back somehow And when you finally disappear, we'll say you were never here Been working for the church while your life falls apart Been singing hallelujah with the fear in your heart Every spark of friendship and love will die without a home Hear the soldier groan, " We'll go at it alone" Hear the soldier groan, " We'll go at it alone"
