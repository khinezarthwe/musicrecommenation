Tough, you think you've got the stuffYou're telling me and anyoneYou're hard enoughYou don't have to put up a fightYou don't have to always be rightLet me take some of the punchesFor you tonightListen to me nowI need to let you knowYou don't have to go it aloneAnd it's you when I look in the mirrorAnd it's you when I don't pick up the phoneSometimes you can't make it on your ownWe fight all the timeYou and I… that's alrightWe're the same soulI don't need… I don't need to hear you sayThat if we weren't so alikeYou'd like me a whole lot moreListen to me nowI need to let you knowYou don't have to go it aloneAnd it's you when I look in the mirrorAnd it's you when I don't pick up the phoneSometimes you can't make it on your ownI know that we don't talkI'm sick of it allCan - you - hear - me – when – I -Sing, you're the reason I singYou're the reason why the opera is in me…Where are we now?I've got to let you knowA house still doesn't make a homeDon't leave me here alone...And it's you when I look in the mirrorAnd it's you that makes it hard to let goSometimes you can't make it on your ownSometimes you can't make itThe best you can do is to fake itSometimes you can't make it on your own
