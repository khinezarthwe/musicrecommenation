Tonight's the night that we got the truck We're going downtown, gonna beat up drunks Your turn to drive, I'll bring the beer It's the late, late shift, no one to fear And ride Ride, how we ride And ride Lowride It's roundup time where the good whores We're gonna drag one screaming off the street And ride Ride, how ride ride Got a black uniform and a silver badge Playing cops for real, playing cops for pay Let's ride Lowride Pull down your dress, here's a kick in the ass Let's beat you blue 'til you shit in your pants Don't move, child, got a big black stick There's six of us, babe, so suck on my dick And ride Ride, how we ride And ride Lowride The left newspapers might whine a bit But the guys at the station, they don't give a shit Dispatch calls, " Are you doing something wicked?" No siree, Jack, we're just giving tickets Let's ride Ride, how we ride And ride Ride, how we ride And ride Ride, how we ride Let's ride Lowride
