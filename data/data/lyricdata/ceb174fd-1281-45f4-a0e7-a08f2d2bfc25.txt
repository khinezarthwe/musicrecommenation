In my platforms I hit the floorFell face down didn't help my brain outThen the baby came before I foundThe magic how to keep her happyI never was the fantasyOf what you want wanted me to beBut don't judge me so harsh little girlSo you've got a playboy mommyBut when you tell them my name andYou want to cross that bridge all on your ownLittle girl they'll do you no harmBecause they know your playboy mommyBut when you tell them my nameFrom here to Birmingham, I got a few friendsI never was there, was there when it countsI get my way you're so like meYou seemed ashamed, ashamed that I wasA good friend of American soldiersI'll say it loud here by your graveThose angels can't ever take my placeDon't judge me so harsh little girlYou got a playboy mommyBut when you tell them my name andYou want to cross that bridge all on your ownLittle girl they'll do you no harmBecause they know your playboy mommyBut you just tell them my nameYou tell them my name, I got a few friendsSomewhere where the orchids growI can't find those church bellsThat played when you diedPlayed Gloria, talking about HosannaDon't judge me so harsh little girlYou got a playboy mommy come homeBut when you tell them soldiers my nameYou cross that bridge all on your ownLittle girl they'll do you no harm'Cause they know your playboy mommyBut I'll be home, I'll be homeTo take you in my arms
