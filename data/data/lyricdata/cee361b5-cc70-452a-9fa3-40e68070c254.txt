All of my life I been searching, walking on easy ground The son of my father, never being pushed around I've got the lord in my shadow, the devil in my blood If you fool me, baby, I'm going to get you like a good man should Like a gypsy, a traveller I was born A vagabond without virtue, I was blessed before the dawn I greet the morning with my back against the sun You'll never see me, baby, 'cause I'm always on the run I got time on my side, I don't need nobody to hold me Time on my side, Sister Bluebird told me Time on my side, lean upon my shoulder I'm bound to settle down before I get much older Born on the dark side, where the sun man never shone I never had nobody to cry when I was gone I'm always in the moonwalk, I got the drifter in my blood If you fool me, baby, I'm going to get you like a good man should I got time on my side, I don't need nobody to hold me Time on my side, Sister Bluebird told me Time on my side, lean upon my shoulder I'm bound to settle down before I get much older Time on my side, I don't need nobody to hold me Time on my side, Sister Bluebird told me Time on my side, lean upon my shoulder I'm bound to settle down before I get much older Time on my side, I don't need, I don't need nobody Time on my side, I got the lord, the lord in my shadow Time on my side, lean upon my shoulder Time on my side, I don't need no one Time on my side, I got the devil, the devil in my blood Time on my side, I don't need it any more
