All of my life I been searching, walking on easy groundThe son of my father, never being pushed aroundI've got the lord in my shadow, the devil in my bloodIf you fool me, baby, I'm going to get you like a good man shouldLike a gypsy, a traveller I was bornA vagabond without virtue, I was blessed before the dawnI greet the morning with my back against the sunYou'll never see me, baby, 'cause I'm always on the runI got time on my side, I don't need nobody to hold meTime on my side, Sister Bluebird told meTime on my side, lean upon my shoulderI'm bound to settle down before I get much olderBorn on the dark side, where the sun man never shoneI never had nobody to cry when I was goneI'm always in the moonwalk, I got the drifter in my bloodIf you fool me, baby, I'm going to get you like a good man shouldI got time on my side, I don't need nobody to hold meTime on my side, Sister Bluebird told meTime on my side, lean upon my shoulderI'm bound to settle down before I get much olderTime on my side, I don't need nobody to hold meTime on my side, Sister Bluebird told meTime on my side, lean upon my shoulderI'm bound to settle down before I get much olderTime on my side, I don't need, I don't need nobodyTime on my side, I got the lord, the lord in my shadowTime on my side, lean upon my shoulderTime on my side, I don't need no oneTime on my side, I got the devil, the devil in my bloodTime on my side, I don't need it any more
