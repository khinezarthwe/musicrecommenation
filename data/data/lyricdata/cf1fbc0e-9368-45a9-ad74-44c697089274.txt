This is the room, the start of it allNo portrait so fine, only sheets on the wallsI've seen the nights, filled with bloodsports and painAnd the bodies obtained, the bodies obtainedWhere will it end?Where will it end?Where will it end?Where will it end?These are your friends from childhood through youthWho goaded you on, demanded full proofWithdrawal pain is hard, it can do you right inSo distorted and thin, distorted and thinWhere will it end?Where will it end?Where will it end?Where will it end?This is the car at the edge of the roadThere's nothing disturbed, all the windows are closedI guess you were right when we talked in the heatThere's no room for the weak, no room for the weakWhere will it end?Where will it end?Where will it end?Where will it end?This is the room, the start of it allThrough childhood, through youth, I remember it allOh, I've seen the nights filled with bloodsport and painAnd the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained, the bodies obtainedWhere will it end?Where will it end?Where will it end?Where will it end?
