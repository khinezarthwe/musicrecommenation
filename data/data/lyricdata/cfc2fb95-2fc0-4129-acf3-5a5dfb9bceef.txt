I've got a little black book with my poems inI've got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb inWhen I'm a good dog, they sometimes throw me a bone inI got elastic bands keeping my shoes onGot those swollen hand bluesI've got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V. to choose fromI've got electric lightAnd I've got second sightI've got amazing powers of observationAnd that is how I knowWhen I try to get throughOn the telephone to youThere'll be nobody homeI've got the obligatorypermAnd the inevitable pinhole burnsAll down the front of my favourite satin shirtI've got nicotine stains on my fingersI've got a silver spoon on a chainI've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remainsI've got wild staring eyesAnd I've got a strong urge to flyBut I've got nowhere to fly toOoooh babe when I pick up the phoneThere's still nobody homeI've got a pair of Gohills bootsAnd I've got fading roots
