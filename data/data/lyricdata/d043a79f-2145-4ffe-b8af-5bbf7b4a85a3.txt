This old heart of mine, been broke a thousand times Each time you break away, I think your gonna stay Lonely nights that come, Memories that go Bringing you back again, Hurting me more and more. Maybe it's my mistake To show this love I feel inside,' Cause each day that passes by, You got me never knowing if I'm coming or going but I... I love you, This old heart, darling is weak for you I love you, Yes I do (yes I do) These old arms of mine Miss having you around, Makes these tears inside Start falling down. Always with half a kiss You remind of what I miss, Though I try to control myself, Like a fool I start feeling 'cause my head starts spinning 'cause I I love you, This old heart, darling is weak for you I love you, Yes I do (yes I do) I try hard to hide My hurt inside, This old heart of mine Always leaves me crying, The way you're treating me Leaves me incomplete, You're here for the day, Gone for the week now. But if you leave me a hundred times, A hundred times I'll take you back. I'm yours, whenever you want me, I'm not too proud to shout it, tell the world about it 'cause I I love you, This old heart, darling is weak for you I love you, This old heart, darling is weak for you( Darling I) I love you, This old heart of mine darling is weak for you I love you, yes I do, yes I do I love you, Yes I do, darling it's weak for you.
