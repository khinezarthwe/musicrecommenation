Smashing through the boundaries Storming through the burning fields Stand before the Evil One on towards the morning sun Falling under skies of pain Soldiers searching endlessly Crashing over seven seas Torture in the winter skies, riding over plains of ice Shadows in the fields of the slain Crashing steel and raging fury Smash the cross, destroy the army Crush the legions of the twilight Templars of steel will burn Cry far away, as we reach for the day Blasting our way through the punishment and the pain Reach for the world, as the sky begins to fall Rising through the darkened ashes, praying that I'll see you all Far away will our eyes now see the day For today, the everlasting eternal sun Washed away the dreams of a brighter day Forever hold the dream inside The chance to fight another fight The breaking hearts that stand for all our lives Live tonight Watch you die, I watch you die inside While fear controls your life Then reject this animosity That kills so many minds We feel the power deep within The fear you hold inside Just to find the reason for the treason Now, you will be mine Screams of pain and death descending Rise again from hell defending Burn their hearts within the fire Warriors of light will be slain Rise through the pain like the sun will rise again Day after day, but the memories never change Stand before the storm, as the last horizon falls Blinded by the vision and the innocence of our souls Far away will our eyes now see the day For today, the everlasting eternal sun Washed away the dreams of a brighter day Forever hold the dream inside The chance to fight another fight The breaking hearts that stand for all our lives Live tonight
