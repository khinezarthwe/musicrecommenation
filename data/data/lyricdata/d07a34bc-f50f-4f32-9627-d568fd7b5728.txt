Smashing through the boundariesStorming through the burning fieldsStand before the Evil One on towards the morning sunFalling under skies of painSoldiers searching endlesslyCrashing over seven seasTorture in the winter skies, riding over plains of iceShadows in the fields of the slainCrashing steel and raging furySmash the cross, destroy the armyCrush the legions of the twilightTemplars of steel will burnCry far away, as we reach for the dayBlasting our way through the punishment and the painReach for the world, as the sky begins to fallRising through the darkened ashes, praying that I'll see you allFar away will our eyes now see the dayFor today, the everlasting eternal sunWashed away the dreams of a brighter dayForever hold the dream insideThe chance to fight another fightThe breaking hearts that stand for all our livesLive tonightWatch you die, I watch you die insideWhile fear controls your lifeThen reject this animosityThat kills so many mindsWe feel the power deep withinThe fear you hold insideJust to find the reason for the treasonNow, you will be mineScreams of pain and death descendingRise again from hell defendingBurn their hearts within the fireWarriors of light will be slainRise through the pain like the sun will rise againDay after day, but the memories never changeStand before the storm, as the last horizon fallsBlinded by the vision and the innocence of our soulsFar away will our eyes now see the dayFor today, the everlasting eternal sunWashed away the dreams of a brighter dayForever hold the dream insideThe chance to fight another fightThe breaking hearts that stand for all our livesLive tonight
