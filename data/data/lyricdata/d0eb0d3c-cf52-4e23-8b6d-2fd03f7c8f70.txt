Nobody searches Nobody cares somehow When the loving that you've wasted Comes raining from a hapless cloud Then I might stop and look upon your face Disappear in the sweet sweet gaze See the living that surrounds me Dissipate in a violent blaze Can't you see what you've done to my heart and soul This is a wasteland now We spies we slow hands You put the weights all around your self We spies oh yeah we slow hands You put the weights all around your self now I submit my incentive is romance I watch the pole dance of the stars We rejoice because the hurting is so painless From the distance of passing cars But I am married to your charms and grace I just feel crazy like the good old days You make me want to pick up a guitar And celebrate the myriad ways that I love you Can't you see what you've done to my heart and soul This is a wasteland now We spies yeah we slow hands You put the weights all around your self We spies oh yeah we slow hands Killer for hire you know not yourself We spies we slow hands You put the weights all around your self We spies oh yeah we slow hands We retire like nobody else We spies intimate slow hands Killer for hire you know not yourself We spies intimate slow hands You let the face slap around the self
