Nobody searchesNobody cares somehowWhen the loving that you've wastedComes raining from a hapless cloudThen I might stop and look upon your faceDisappear in the sweet sweet gazeSee the living that surrounds meDissipate in a violent blazeCan't you see what you've done to my heart and soulThis is a wasteland nowWe spies we slow handsYou put the weights all around your selfWe spies oh yeah we slow handsYou put the weights all around your self nowI submit my incentive is romanceI watch the pole dance of the starsWe rejoice because the hurting is so painlessFrom the distance of passing carsBut I am married to your charms and graceI just feel crazy like the good old daysYou make me want to pick up a guitarAnd celebrate the myriad ways that I love youCan't you see what you've done to my heart and soulThis is a wasteland nowWe spies yeah we slow handsYou put the weights all around your selfWe spies oh yeah we slow handsKiller for hire you know not yourselfWe spies we slow handsYou put the weights all around your selfWe spies oh yeah we slow handsWe retire like nobody elseWe spies intimate slow handsKiller for hire you know not yourselfWe spies intimate slow handsYou let the face slap around the self
