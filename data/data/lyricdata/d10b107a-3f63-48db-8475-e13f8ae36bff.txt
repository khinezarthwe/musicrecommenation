Watching from a post up highFrom where you see the ships afarFrom a well-trained eyeThe waves all keep on crashing byIf you are the light postThen you own the working classBut if you want the answersYou better give a piece of assGive a piece of your assWarning, post hypnotic suggestionsRunning the ships ashoreThe orange light that followsWill soon proclaim itself a godIf you point your questionsThe fog will surely chew you upBut if you want the answersYou better get ready for the fireGet ready for the fireThe ships are multiplying day after day, sirAnd they're coming close to the shore, sir, shore, sirWe need to evacuate the light postIt's all over, it's all overIt's all overSONG MEANING: Serj Tankian, the lead singer, says this song is about post-hypnotic suggestion being used in the assassination of President Kennedy. Go figure.
