Hey you, out there in the coldGetting lonely, getting oldCan you feel me?Hey you, standing in the aislesWith itchy feet and fading smilesCan you feel me?Hey you, don't help them to bury the lightDon't give in without a fightHey you, out there on your ownSitting naked by the phoneWould you touch me?Hey you, with your ear against the wallWaiting for someone to call outWould you touch me?Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?Open your heart, I'm coming homeBut it was only fantasyThe wall was too highAs you can seeNo matter how he triedHe could not break freeAnd the worms ate into his brainHey you, out there on the roadAlways doing what you're toldCan you help me?Hey you, out there beyond the wallBreaking bottles in the hallCan you help me?Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at allTogether we stand, divided we fall"Well, only got an hour of daylight left.
