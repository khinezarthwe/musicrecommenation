A cry for help, a hint of anaesthesia. The sound from broken homes; we used to always meet hereAs he lays asleep, she takes him in her arms. Some things I have to do, but I don't mean you harmA worried parent's glance, a kiss, a last goodbye.

I can't see why all these dislocationsNo family life, this makes me feel uneasy. Stood alone here in this colonyIn this colony. In this colony. In this colony.
