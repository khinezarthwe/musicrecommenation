You say I only hear what I want to You say I talk so all the time So And I thought what I felt was simple And I thought that I don't belong And now that I am leavin' Now I know that I did somethin' wrong 'cause I missed you Yeah, yeah I missed you And you say I only hear what I want to, I don't listen hard Don't pay attention to the distance that you're runnin' To anyone, anywhere, I Don't understand if you really care, I'm only hearing negative No, no, no (bad) So I, I turn the radio on, I turn the radio up And this woman was singin' my song Lovers in love and the others run away Lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay Some of us hover while we're waiting for the other who was dyin' since the day they were born, well Well, this is not that, think that I'm throwin' but I'm thrown And I thought I'd live forever But now I'm not so sure You try to tell me that I'm clever That won't take me anyhow Or anywhere With you You said that I was naive, and (naive...) I thought that I was strong, oh I thought, "hey, I can leave, I can leave", oh (leave...) But now I know that I was wrong, 'cause I missed you Yeah... I miss you You said, " You caught me 'cause you want me" and one day you let me go You try to keep away a keeper or keep me 'cause you know you're just so Scared to lose And you say" Stay" You say I only hear what I want to
