Lie Lie to my face Tell me it ain't nothing That's what I wanna hear Take The lie to the grave That's what an old friend told me Look what it did for him Oh Oh The truth hurts so bad, wouldn't you say? So why tell it? If ignorance is bliss, then I'm in Heaven now Run You'll never escape You see, you'll go nowhere Based on who you appear Broke Laid to waste Turn into sweet nothings Kiss you goodbye Oh Oh Oh Oh The truth hurts so bad, wouldn't you say? So why tell it? If ignorance is bliss, then I'm in Heaven now I keep going over and over again The neverending places I've never been No one's catching on, calling my bluff The Devil made me, only we never met What'd you do? Say it with a smile, boy Making us all forget What'd you do? Say it with a smile, boy Making us all forget Making us all forget Making us all forget The truth Has always had three sides Mine, yours and how it went The truth Has always been a lie I'm never telling it Making us all forget Making us all forget Swear to God
