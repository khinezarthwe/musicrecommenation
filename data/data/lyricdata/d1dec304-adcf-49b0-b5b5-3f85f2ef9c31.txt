By, oh by The way of an explanation Cast, adrift Off the shore's, of shorty's nation I had a lick It caved my skull in like a brick Call now, what use Am I to anyone I'm fucked, forlorn, frozen Beneath the summer Don't sing along Or you'll get what I got So, here comes a delivery Straight from the heart of my misery So, here comes a delivery Straight from the heart to you Yeah you, now you, now you You've finally left school Oh, what, on earth Do you intend to do? See if you can take the man Go downtown Where all, you skins and mods You get together Make, pretend It's 1969 forever Find a girl, have a drink Have a dance and pray This song might deliver me Straight from the harshness of misery Is a song that you'll ever hear Straight from the heart to you Yes, here comes a delivery Straight from the heart of my misery Or a song might deliver me Straight from the heart to you Yes, here comes a delivery Straight from the heart of the misery Here comes a delivery Straight from the heart to you
