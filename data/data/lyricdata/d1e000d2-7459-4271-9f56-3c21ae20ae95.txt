Don't you be a traffic light Don't you be a traffic light With all things said You turn to red Don't you be a traffic light And don't you be a roundabout No, not another roundabout We've come so far Yet back to the start Don't you be a roundabout Oh now baby, don't misread the signs If you just turn the key Then things will turn out fine Let's not have a break down No, not another breakdown You're on your own a long way from home Let's not have a breakdown Don't misread the signs If you just turn the key Then things will turn out fine You're pushing me, you're breaking Over taking me, you're racing First placing me not chasing me back home With all things said You turn to red Don't you be a traffic light Don't let me down
