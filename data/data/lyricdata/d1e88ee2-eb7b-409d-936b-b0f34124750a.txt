In the still of the night, in the world's ancient lightWhere wisdom grows up in strifeMy bewildered brain toils in vainThrough the darkness on the pathways of lifeEach invisible prayer is like a cloud in the airTomorrow keeps turning aroundWe live and we die, we know not whyBut I'll be with you when the deal goes downWe eat and we drink, we feel and we thinkFar down the street we strayI laugh and I cry and I'm haunted byThings I never meant nor wished to sayThe midnight rain follows the trainWe all wear the same thorny crownSoul to soul, our shadows rollAnd I'll be with you when the deal goes downWell, the moon gives light and it shines by nightWhen I scarcely feel the glowWe learn to live and then we forgiveO'er the road we're bound to goMore frailer than the flowers, these precious hoursThat keep us so tightly boundYou come to my eyes like a vision from the skiesAnd I'll be with you when the deal goes downWell, I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothesI followed the winding streamI heard the deafening noise, I felt transient joysI know they're not what they seemIn this earthly domain full of disappointment and painYou'll never see me frownI owe my heart to you and that's sayin' it trueAnd I'll be with you when the deal goes down
