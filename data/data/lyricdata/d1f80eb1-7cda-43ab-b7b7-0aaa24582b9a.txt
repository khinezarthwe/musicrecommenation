When routine bites hard, ambitions are lowResentment rides high, emotions won't growWe're changing our ways, taking different roadsLove will tear us apart againLove will tear us apart againWhy is the bedroom so cold? You've turned away on your sideIs my timing that flawed? Our respect runs so dryYet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our livesLove will tear us apart againLove will tear us apart againYou cry out in your sleep, all my failings exposedAnd there's a taste in my mouth as desperation takes holdJust that something so good just can't function no moreLove will tear us apart againLove will tear us apart againLove will tear us apart againLove will tear us apart again
