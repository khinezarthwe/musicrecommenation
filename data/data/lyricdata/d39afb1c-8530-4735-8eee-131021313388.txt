You swear you recall nothing at allThat could make you come back downYou made up your mind to leave it all behindNow you're forced to fight it outYou fall away from your pastBut it's following youYou left something undone, it's now your rerunIt's the one you can't eraseYou should have made it right, so you wouldn't have to fightTo put a smile back on your faceYou fall away from your pastBut it's following youYou fall awaySomething I've done that I can't outrunMaybe you should wait maybe you should runBut there's something you've said that can't be undoneAnd you fall away from your pastBut It's following youYou fall awayIt's following you
