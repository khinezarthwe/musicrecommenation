Thought you had All the answers To rest your heart upon. But something happens, Don't see it coming, now You can't stop yourself. Now you're out there swimming... In the deep. In the deep.

In the deep. In the deep. And now you're out there spinning... And now you're out there spinning... In the deep. In the deep. In the deep.

In the deep... Now you're out there spinning... Now you're out there swimming... Now you're out there spinning... In the deep. In the deep. In the deep. In the deep...
