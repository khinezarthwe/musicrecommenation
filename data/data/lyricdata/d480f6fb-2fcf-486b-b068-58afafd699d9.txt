Thought you hadAll the answersTo rest your heart upon.But something happens,Don't see it coming, nowYou can't stop yourself.Now you're out there swimming...In the deep.In the deep.Life keeps tumbling your heart in circlesTill you... Let go.Till you shed your pride, and you climb to heaven,And you throw yourself off.Now you're out there spinning...In the deep.In the deep.In the deep.In the deep.And now you're out there spinning...And now you're out there spinning...In the deep.In the deep.In the deep.In the silenceAll your secretsRaise their weary headsAnd you can't pin yourselfBack togetherWith who you thought you were.Now you're out there livin'...In the deep.In the deep.In the deep.In the deep...Now you're out there spinning...Now you're out there swimming...Now you're out there spinning...In the deep.In the deep.In the deep.In the deep...
