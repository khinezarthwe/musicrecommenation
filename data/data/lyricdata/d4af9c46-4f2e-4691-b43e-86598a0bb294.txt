I've been looking for shelter from the pouring rain Walking in circles coming back again Looking out of your window waiting for a while May not be the sweetest woman but I love the way you smile Looks like I been this way before Knocking on the same old door Tell me stranger, have you seen The door locked any time? Well you can shake it, fake it Make it feel so fine And you can always smell the roses But you know you got to draw the line Black satin or lace, a painted face I'll get my loving, I'll leave no trace You can get your fun but it don't come free If you want you can do it with me So follow me down, follow me down Down to Goldie's place I'll see you there In the perfume garden, flowers on the wall Sweet smell of surrender and you can try it all You don't ask no questions, you won't get no lies You can get what you want for your pleasure and you can try it on for size Looks like I been this way before Knocking on the same old door Tell me stranger, have you seen The door locked any time? Well you can shake it, fake it Make it feel so fine And you can always smell the roses But you know you got to draw the line Black satin or lace, a painted face I'll get my loving, I'll leave no trace You can get your fun but it don't come free If you want you can do it with me If you want you can do it with me If you want you can do it with me So follow me down, follow me down Down to Goldie's place I said So follow me down, follow me down Down to Goldie's place I'll see you there So follow me down, follow me down Down to Goldie's place
