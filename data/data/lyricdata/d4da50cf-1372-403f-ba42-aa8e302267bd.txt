A half full moon in Mexico City I think of you When I saw the Southern Cross I wished you had too I wish my heart was as cold as the morning dew But it's as warm as saxophones And honey in the sun for you I've been spending half the year In a plane going up and down You've been seeing other people from a nearby town Been obsessing and getting depressed about us Excess baggage and other stupid band stuff I wish my heart was cold But it's warmer than before I wish my heart was as cold as the morning dew But it's as warm as saxophones And honey in the sun for you When you said the veins in my left hand Were shaped like a tree Was that the very last time you really looked at me? I'm in training to become as cold as ice I'm determined to protect my feelings disguise When I said I didn't love you I told you a lie There no one above you although I try Would you laugh at the time I spent calling your name Over and over and over and over again? The trouble is I got me close to hating me When I wake up in the morning its your face I see Where you once made me feel less afraid You've got me pouring myself all over this page
