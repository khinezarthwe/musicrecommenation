A half full moon in Mexico City I think of youWhen I saw the Southern Cross I wished you had tooI wish my heart was as cold as the morning dewBut it's as warm as saxophonesAnd honey in the sun for youI've been spending half the yearIn a plane going up and downYou've been seeing other people from a nearby townBeen obsessing and getting depressed about usExcess baggage and other stupid band stuffI wish my heart was coldBut it's warmer than beforeI wish my heart was as cold as the morning dewBut it's as warm as saxophonesAnd honey in the sun for youWhen you said the veins in my left handWere shaped like a treeWas that the very last time you really looked at me?I'm in training to become as cold as iceI'm determined to protect my feelings disguiseWhen I said I didn't love you I told you a lieThere no one above you although I tryWould you laugh at the time I spent calling your nameOver and over and over and over again?The trouble is I got me close to hating meWhen I wake up in the morning its your face I seeWhere you once made me feel less afraidYou've got me pouring myself all over this page
