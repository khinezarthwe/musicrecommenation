(" One, two!")" Luck runs out..." Crawl from the wreckage one more time Horrific memory twists the mind Dark, rutted, cold and hard to turn Path of destruction - Feel it burn Still life... Incarnation Still life... Infamy Hallucination, heresy... Still you run What's to come? What's to be?' Cause we hunt you down without mercy Hunt you down, all nightmare long Feel us breathe upon your face Feel us shift - Every move, we trace Hunt you down without mercy Hunt you down, all nightmare long Luck runs out... You crawl back in, but your luck runs out(" One, two!")" Luck runs out..." The light that is not light is here, To flush you out with your own fear You hide, you hide, but will be found Release your grip without a sound Still life... Immolation Still life... Infamy Hallucination, heresy... Still you run What's to come? What's to be?' Cause we hunt you down without mercy Hunt you down, all nightmare long Feel us breathe upon your face Feel us shift - Every move, we trace Hunt you down without mercy Hunt you down, all nightmare long Luck runs out... You crawl back in, but your luck runs out(" One, two, three, four!") Then you crawl back in, Into your obsession... Never to return This is your confession Hunt you down without mercy Hunt you down, all nightmare long Feel us breathe upon your face Feel us shift - Every move, we trace Hunt you down without mercy Hunt you down, all nightmare long Luck runs out... You crawl back in, but your luck runs out Luck runs out!
