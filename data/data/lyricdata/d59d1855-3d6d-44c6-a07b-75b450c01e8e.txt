I'd like to drop my trousers to the worldI am a man of means (of slender means)Each household applianceIs like a new science in my townAnd if the day came when I felt a natural emotionI'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the oceanAnd when a train goes byIt's such a sad soundIt's such a sad thingI'd like to drop my trousers to the QueenEvery sensible child will know what this meansThe poor and the needyAre selfish and greedy on her termsAnd if the day came when I felt a natural emotionI'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the oceanAnd when a train goes byIt's such a sad soundIt's such a sad thingAnd when I'm lying in my bedI think about life and then I think about deathAnd neither one particularly appeals to meAnd if the day came when I felt a natural emotionI'd get such a shock I'd probably lieIn the middle of the street and dieI'd lie down and die
