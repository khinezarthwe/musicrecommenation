I beat my machine, it's a part of me, it's inside of me I'm stuck in this dream, it's changing me, I am becoming The me that you know he had some second thoughts He's covered with scabs, he is broken and sore The me that you know he doesn't come around much That part of me isn't here anymore All pain disappears, it's the nature of, of my circuitry Drowns out all I hear, no escape from this, my new consciousness The me that you know he used to have feelings But the blood has stopped pumping and he's left to decay The me that you know is now made up of wires And even when I'm right with you I'm so far away I can try to get away but I've strapped myself in I can try to scratch away the sound in my ears I can see it killing away all of my bad parts I don't want to listen but it's all too clear Hiding backwards inside of me I feel so unafraid Annie, hold a little tighter, I might just slip away It won't give up it wants me dead Goddamn this noise inside my head It won't give up it wants me dead Goddamn this noise inside my head It won't give up it wants me dead Goddamn this noise inside my head It won't give up it wants me dead Goddamn this noise inside my head It won't give up it wants me dead Goddamn this noise inside my head It won't give up it wants me dead Goddamn this noise inside my head It won't give up it wants me dead Goddamn this noise inside my head It won't give up it wants me dead Goddamn this noise inside my head
