I beat my machine, it's a part of me, it's inside of meI'm stuck in this dream, it's changing me, I am becomingThe me that you know he had some second thoughtsHe's covered with scabs, he is broken and soreThe me that you know he doesn't come around muchThat part of me isn't here anymoreAll pain disappears, it's the nature of, of my circuitryDrowns out all I hear, no escape from this, my new consciousnessThe me that you know he used to have feelingsBut the blood has stopped pumping and he's left to decayThe me that you know is now made up of wiresAnd even when I'm right with you I'm so far awayI can try to get away but I've strapped myself inI can try to scratch away the sound in my earsI can see it killing away all of my bad partsI don't want to listen but it's all too clearHiding backwards inside of me I feel so unafraidAnnie, hold a little tighter, I might just slip awayIt won't give up it wants me deadGoddamn this noise inside my headIt won't give up it wants me deadGoddamn this noise inside my headIt won't give up it wants me deadGoddamn this noise inside my headIt won't give up it wants me deadGoddamn this noise inside my headIt won't give up it wants me deadGoddamn this noise inside my headIt won't give up it wants me deadGoddamn this noise inside my headIt won't give up it wants me deadGoddamn this noise inside my headIt won't give up it wants me deadGoddamn this noise inside my head
