Don't like the things you don't sayLeaving it for such a long, long timeWhy do you show me those sad, sad eyesEach time you decide to pass on by?And when you smileThose sad eyesLook sadder and sadder stillAutumn's hue in those sad eyesMakes me love and love them moreWe'll have a bath, I'll make the dinnerThen I'll go away for a long, long timeBut still, you've not passed by doorI can tell that you're lonely but it seems nowThere's nothing you want me to doI won't try to take the sadness from those eyes that I loveLeave it open for someone else toTrying to hold it togetherKeep my love as light as a featherSad eyes, babyIt's been such a long timeKeep my heart breaking in the darkCome and spend the nightSad eyes, I'm trying to hold it togetherKeep my love as light as a featherKeep my heart breaking in the darkCome and spend the night
