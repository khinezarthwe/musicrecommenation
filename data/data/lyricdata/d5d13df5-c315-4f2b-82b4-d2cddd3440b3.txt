Don't like the things you don't say Leaving it for such a long, long time Why do you show me those sad, sad eyes Each time you decide to pass on by? And when you smile Those sad eyes Look sadder and sadder still Autumn's hue in those sad eyes Makes me love and love them more We'll have a bath, I'll make the dinner Then I'll go away for a long, long time But still, you've not passed by door I can tell that you're lonely but it seems now There's nothing you want me to do I won't try to take the sadness from those eyes that I love Leave it open for someone else to Trying to hold it together Keep my love as light as a feather Sad eyes, baby It's been such a long time Keep my heart breaking in the dark Come and spend the night Sad eyes, I'm trying to hold it together Keep my love as light as a feather Keep my heart breaking in the dark Come and spend the night
