Fear and panic in the airI want to be freeFrom desolation and despairAnd I feel like everything I sowIs being swept awayWell I refuse to let you goI can't get it rightGet it rightSince I met youLoneliness be overWhen will this loneliness be over?Life will flash before my eyesSo scattered and lostI want to touch the other sideAnd no one thinks they are to blameWhy can't we seeThat when we bleed, we bleed the sameI can't get it rightGet it rightSince I met youLoneliness be overWhen will this loneliness be over?Loneliness be overWhen will this loneliness be over?
