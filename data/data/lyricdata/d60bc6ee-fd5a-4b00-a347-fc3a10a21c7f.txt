Now the king told the boogie men You have to let that raga drop The oil down the desert way Has been shaken to the top The sheikh, he drove his Cadillac He went a-cruisin' down the ville The muezzin was a-standin' On the radiator grille The sharif don't like it Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah The sharif don't like it Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah By order of the Prophet We ban that boogie sound Degenerate the faithful With that crazy Casbah sound But the Bedouin they brought out The electric kettle drum The local guitar picker Got his guitar picking thumb As soon as the sharif Had cleared the square They began to wail The sharif don't like it Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah The sharif don't like it Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah Now over at the temple Oh, they really pack 'em in The in crowd say it's cool To dig this chanting thing But as the wind changed direction And the temple band took five The crowd caught a whiff Of that crazy Casbah jive! The sharif don't like it Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah The sharif don't like it Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah The king called up his jet fighters He said you better earn your pay Drop your bombs between the minarets Down the Casbah way As soon as the sharif was chauffeured outta there The jet pilots tuned to the cockpit radio blare As soon as the sharif was outta their hair The jet pilots wailed The sharif don't like it Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah The sharif don't like it Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah The sharif don't like it ( He thinks it's not kosher) Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah The sharif don't like it ( Fundamentally he can't take it) Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah The sharif don't like it ( You know he really hates it!) Rockin' the Casbah, rock the Casbah
