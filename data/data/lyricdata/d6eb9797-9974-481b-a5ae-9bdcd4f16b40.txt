I want to buy you flowersIt's such a shame you're a boyBut when you are not a girlNobody buys you flowersI want to buy you flowersAnd now I'm standing in the shopI must confess I wonderIf you will like my flowersYou are so sweet and I'm so aloneOh darling pleaseTell me you're the oneI'll buy you flowersI'll buy you flowersLike no other girl did beforeYou were so sweet and I was in loveOh darling don't tell meYou found another girlForget the flowersBecause the flowersNever last for everNever last for everNever last for everMy love
