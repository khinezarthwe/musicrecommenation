A simple scent of summer stole my heart for the last dance The smell of two-stroke petrol from a motorbike we used to have Those playing fields of cut grass you know high school left me kind of blue Now with every sweet summer breeze I'll be thinking of you Now I'm waiting for the sunset borderline Every suns gotta set with time But I'll remember those moments for evermore As the days where nothing had changed at all. Found a long lost picture of the car we used to run Cotton candy coloured paintwork looked so faded in the sun And that 6 o clock sunrise you always used to drive me to Guess that long lost picture will always have me thinking, have me thinking of you Now I'm waiting for the sunset borderline Every suns gotta set with time But I'll remember those moments for evermore As the days where nothing had changed at all. So for every little sad sweet love song that's ever sung, I'll be thinking And for every lost summers day that ever been and gone, I'll be thinking I wonder if your gonna be the tear that follows me, Until that sun is set I guess I'll always be Waiting for the sunset borderline Every suns gotta set with time But I'll remember those moments for evermore As the days where nothing had changed at all. Turned into the radio flicking through the stations one by one Tried to listen through the rain while Humming those melodies alone I remember how you told me lennon & mccartney Always pulled you through So as the music fades out I'll be thinking, I'll be thinking of you
