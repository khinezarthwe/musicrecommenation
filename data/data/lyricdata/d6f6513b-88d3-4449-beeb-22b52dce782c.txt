A simple scent of summer stole my heart for the last danceThe smell of two-stroke petrol from a motorbike we used to haveThose playing fields of cut grass you know high school left me kind of blueNow with every sweet summer breeze I'll be thinking of youNow I'm waiting for the sunset borderlineEvery suns gotta set with timeBut I'll remember those moments for evermoreAs the days where nothing had changed at all.Found a long lost picture of the car we used to runCotton candy coloured paintwork looked so faded in the sunAnd that 6 o clock sunrise you always used to drive me toGuess that long lost picture will always have me thinking, have me thinking of youNow I'm waiting for the sunset borderlineEvery suns gotta set with timeBut I'll remember those moments for evermoreAs the days where nothing had changed at all.So for every little sad sweet love song that's ever sung, I'll be thinkingAnd for every lost summers day that ever been and gone, I'll be thinkingI wonder if your gonna be the tear that follows me,Until that sun is set I guess I'll always beWaiting for the sunset borderlineEvery suns gotta set with timeBut I'll remember those moments for evermoreAs the days where nothing had changed at all.Turned into the radio flicking through the stations one by oneTried to listen through the rain whileHumming those melodies aloneI remember how you told me lennon & mccartneyAlways pulled you throughSo as the music fades out I'll be thinking, I'll be thinking of you
