I'm in a van,And you're holding my handAnd you were travelling with me through forest and sandsI've been ever so needy learning your languageAnd you've been taking full advantage, haven't you?Oh, don't say it's trueI've been so afraid,I'm a sadness againAnd we kissed once, even that was the lastI know I need more than givenMoments and sentimental storiesWords only spoken seeminglyThat I'm warming your heart that wayOh, it feels like none of this is realI'll pretend that my heart and my head are wellBut if the blood pumping through my veins could freeze,Like a river in Toronto,Then I'd bleed please,You said I made you feel warm, said I made you feel warm insideOh, it feels like none of this is realI'll pretend that my heart and my head are wellBut if the blood pumping through my veins could freeze,Like a river in Toronto,Then I'd bleed please,You said I made you feel warm, said I made you feel warm insideIt feels like none of this is realI'll pretend that my heart and my head are wellBut if the blood pumping through my veins could freeze,Like a river in Toronto,Then I'd bleed please,You said I made you feel warm, said I made you feel warm inside
