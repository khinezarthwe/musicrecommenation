Everything is gone but the echo of the burst of a shellAnd I'm stuck here waiting for a passing feelingIn the city I built up and blew to HellI'm stuck here waiting for a passing feelingStill I send all the timeMy request for reliefDown a dead power lineThough I'm beyond beliefIn the help I requireJust to exist at allTook a long time to standTook an hour to fallI'm stuck here waiting for a passing feelingStuck here waiting for a passing feelingStill I send all the timeMy request for reliefDown a dead power lineThough I'm beyond beliefIn the help I requireJust to exist at allTook a long time to standTook an hour to fall
