I never knewI never knew that everything was falling throughThat everyone I knew was waiting on a queueTo turn and run when all I needed was the truthBut that's how it's got to beIt's comin' down to nothing more than apathyI'd rather run the other way than stay and seeThe smoke and who's still standing when it clearsAnd everyone knows I'm inOver my head, over my headWith eight seconds left in overtimeShe's on your mind, she's on your mindLet's rearrangeI wish you were a stranger I could disengageJust say that we agree and then never changeSoften a bit until we all just get alongBut that's disregardFind another friend and you discardAs you lose the arguments in a cable carHanging above as the canyon comes betweenAnd everyone knows I'm inOver my head, over my headWith eight seconds left in overtimeShe's on your mind, she's on your mindEveryone knows I'm inOver my head, over my headWith eight seconds left in overtimeShe's on your mind, she's on, ohAnd suddenly, I become a part of your pastI'm becoming the part that don't lastI'm losing you and it's effortlessWithout a soundWe lose sight of the ground in the throw aroundNever thought that you wanted to bring it downI won't let it go down till we torch it ourselvesAnd everyone knows I'm inOver my head, over my headWith eight seconds left in overtimeShe's on your mind, she's on your mindEveryone knows she's on your mindEveryone knows I'm in over my headI'm in over my head, I'm over myâ€¦Everyone knows I'm inOver my head, over my headWith eight seconds left in overtimeShe's on your mind, she's on your mind
