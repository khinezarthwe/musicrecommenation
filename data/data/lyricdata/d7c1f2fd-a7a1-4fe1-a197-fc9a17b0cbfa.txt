You come out at nightThat's when the energy comesAnd the dark side's lightAnd the vampires roamYou strut your rasta wearAnd your suicide poemAnd a cross from a faith that diedBefore Jesus cameYou're building a mysteryYou live in a churchWhere you sleep with voodoo dollsAnd you won't give up the searchFor the ghosts in the hallsYou wear sandals in the snowAnd a smile that won't wash awayCan you look out the windowWithout your shadow getting in the way?You're so beautifulWith an edge and charmAnd so carefulWhen I'm in your armsCause you're workingBuilding a mysteryHolding on and holding it inYeah you're workingBuilding a mysteryAnd choosing so carefullyYou woke up screaming aloudA prayer from your secret godBut you feed off our fearsAnd hold back your tears, ohYou give us a tantrumAnd a know it all grinJust when we need oneWhen the evening's thinYou're so beautifulA beautiful fucked-up manYou're setting up yourRazor-wire shrineCause you're workingBuilding a mysteryHolding on and holding it inYeah you're workingBuilding a mysteryAnd choosing so carefullyOoh you're workingBuilding a mysteryHolding on and holding it inYeah you're workingBuilding a mysteryAnd choosing so carefullyYeah you're workingBuilding a mysteryHolding on and holding it inYeah you're workingBuilding a mysteryAnd choosing so carefullyYou're building a mystery
