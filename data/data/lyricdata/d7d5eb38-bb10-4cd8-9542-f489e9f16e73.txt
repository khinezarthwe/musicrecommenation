She's mostly gone, some other placeI'm getting by in other waysEverything they whispered in our ear is coming trueTry to justify the things I used to doBelieve in youWatching you drownI'll follow you downI am here right beside youThe lights in the skyHave finally arrivedI am staying right beside youI tried to stay away, just in caseI've come to realize we all have our placeTime, time has a way, you know, to make it clearAnd I have my role in this, I can't disappearOr leave you hereWatching you drownI'll follow you downAnd I am here right beside youThe lights in the skyAre waving goodbyeAnd I am staying right beside you
