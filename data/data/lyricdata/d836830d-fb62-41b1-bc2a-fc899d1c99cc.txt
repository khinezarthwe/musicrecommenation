OohOohOohOohGold teeth and a curse for this townWere all in my mouthOnly I don't know howThey got out, dearTurn me back into the petI was when we metI was happier then with no mindsetAnd if you took to me like a gull takes to the windOh, I'd have jumped from my trees and I'd have danced like the king of the eyesores and the rest of our lives would have fared wellNew slang when you notice the stripesThe dirt in your friesHope it's right when you dieOld and bonyDawn breaks like a bull through the hallNever should have calledBut my head's to the wall and I'm lonelyAnd if you took to me like a gull takes to the windI'd have jumped from my trees and I'd have danced like the king of the eyesores and the rest of our lives would have fared wellAhAhGodspeed all the bakers at dawnMay they all cut their thumbsAnd bleed into their buns 'til they melt awayI'm looking in on the good life I might be doomed never to findWithout a trust or flaming fields, am I too dumb to refine?And if you took to me like aI'd have danced like the queen of the eyesores and the rest of our lives would have fared wellOohOoh
