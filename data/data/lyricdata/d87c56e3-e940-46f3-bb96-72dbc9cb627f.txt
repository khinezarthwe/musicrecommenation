I've walked the distance, I paid my dues and tried to have a go at what I thought I knew was real, held no appealI've been to places, I've seen the tidings,I bought a book of rules for every coin that I could stealAnd so I came to gaze upon the stars, when they were yet unbornAnd consequently, tear at my old scars, and the mask I had outwornSo when I'm crying aloneYeah, when I'm cold as a dying stoneGrow me a garden of rosesPaint me the colors of sky and rainTeach me to speak with their voicesShow me the way and I'll try againI've heard the rumors, started fires, I sowed a sordid lot of plays for keeps for what I need, behold the demons that I freedI've tried my best at wearing the hard hat, but healing doesn't seem to happen when you hide away the seedAnd so I came across the medicine man, and he showed me what I'd forlornFor if I'm stayed it happens by my own hand, and my own voice full of scornSo when I'm crying aloneYeah, when I'm cold as a dying stoneGrow me a garden of rosesPaint me the colors of sky and rainTeach me to speak with their voicesShow me the way and I'll try againWithout you I'm nothing at allAnd life has the face of a morbid gameWith you nothing is impossibleIt all seems to fit the frameSo when I'm crying aloneYeah, when I'm cold as a dying stoneGrow me a garden of rosesPaint me the colors of sky and rainTeach me to speak with their voicesShow me the way and I'll try again
