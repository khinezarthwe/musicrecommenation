The King's Crossing was the main attraction, dominoes falling in a chain reaction The scraping subject ruled by fear told me whiskey works better than beer The judge is on vinyl, decisions are final, and nobody gets a reprieve And every wave is tidal, if you hang around you're going to get wet I can't prepare for death any more than I already have All you can do now is watch the shells The game looks easy, that's why it sells Frustrated fireworks inside your head are gonna stand and deliver talk instead The method acting that pays my bills keeps the fat man feeding in Beverly Hills I got a heavy metal mouth that hurls obscenity And I get my check from the trash treasury Because I took my own insides out It don't matter 'cause I have no sex life, and all I wanna do now is inject my ex-wife I've seen the movie and I know what happens It's Christmas time and the needles on the tree, a skinny Santa is bringing something to me His voice is overwhelming, but his speech is slurred And I only understand every other word Open your parachute and grab your gun, falling down like an omen, a setting sun Read the part and return at 5, it's a hell of a role if you can keep it alive But I don't care if I fuck up, I'm going on a date with a rich white lady Ain't life great? Give me one good reason not to do it (because we love you) So do it This is the place where time reverses And dead men talk to all the pretty nurses Instruments shine on a silver tray Don't let me get carried away Don't let me get carried away Don't let me be carried away
