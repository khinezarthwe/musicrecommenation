The King's Crossing was the main attraction, dominoes falling in a chain reactionThe scraping subject ruled by fear told me whiskey works better than beerThe judge is on vinyl, decisions are final, and nobody gets a reprieveAnd every wave is tidal, if you hang around you're going to get wetI can't prepare for death any more than I already haveAll you can do now is watch the shellsThe game looks easy, that's why it sellsFrustrated fireworks inside your head are gonna stand and deliver talk insteadThe method acting that pays my bills keeps the fat man feeding in Beverly HillsI got a heavy metal mouth that hurls obscenityAnd I get my check from the trash treasuryBecause I took my own insides outIt don't matter 'cause I have no sex life, and all I wanna do now is inject my ex-wifeI've seen the movie and I know what happensIt's Christmas time and the needles on the tree, a skinny Santa is bringing something to meHis voice is overwhelming, but his speech is slurredAnd I only understand every other wordOpen your parachute and grab your gun, falling down like an omen, a setting sunRead the part and return at 5, it's a hell of a role if you can keep it aliveBut I don't care if I fuck up, I'm going on a date with a rich white ladyAin't life great?Give me one good reason not to do it (because we love you)So do itThis is the place where time reversesAnd dead men talk to all the pretty nursesInstruments shine on a silver trayDon't let me get carried awayDon't let me get carried awayDon't let me be carried away
