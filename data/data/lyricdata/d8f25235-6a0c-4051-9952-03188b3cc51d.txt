There's a solitary man crying, hold meIt's only because he's lonelyAnd if the keeper of time runs slowlyHe won't be alive for longIf he only had time to tell of all of the things he plannedWith a card up his sleeve, what would he achieve?It means nothingTo the opium dens and the bar room ginsIn the Belmont chair, playing violinsThe gambler's face cracks into a grinAs he lays down the king of spadesBut the dealer just staresThere's something wrong here, he thinksThe gambler is seized and forced to his kneesAnd shot, deadHe only wanted more timeAway from the darkest doorBut his luck it gave in as the dawn light crept inAnd he lay on the floorFrom the Hundred Year War to the CrimeaWith a lance and a musket and a Roman spearTo all of the men who have stood with no fearIn the service of the KingBefore you met your fateBe sure you did not forsakeYour lover may not be around anymoreThere's a solitary man crying, hold meIt's only because he's lonelyAnd if the keeper of time runs slowlyHe won't be alive for long
