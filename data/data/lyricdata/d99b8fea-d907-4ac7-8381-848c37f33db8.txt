Only the truth she reckons she holdsOnly the truth she reckons she holdsThe way she walks is scripted and taughtDon't give her an eye, she'll sniper your mindSee by her hands that she's been there beforeShe lifts up her glass as if to bring down the massOnly the truth she reckons she holdsOnly the truth she reckons she holdsClimbing the stairs as if to follow her thereHer golden lace boots may stop your right thereHands on your arm, she greets all your friendsWith a twist of a lime, it seems a bitter endOnly the truth she reckons she holdsOnly the truth she reckons she holdsThe girl with many different strategiesWakes the wolves to curse them to their kneesShe's in the one by the riverbank, so it's easier for her to drown youAnd she claims, oh, she claimsIt's only the truth she holds in her handsYes, it's only the truth she holds in her hands
