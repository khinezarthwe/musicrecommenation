Only the truth she reckons she holds Only the truth she reckons she holds The way she walks is scripted and taught Don't give her an eye, she'll sniper your mind See by her hands that she's been there before She lifts up her glass as if to bring down the mass Only the truth she reckons she holds Only the truth she reckons she holds Climbing the stairs as if to follow her there Her golden lace boots may stop your right there Hands on your arm, she greets all your friends With a twist of a lime, it seems a bitter end Only the truth she reckons she holds Only the truth she reckons she holds The girl with many different strategies Wakes the wolves to curse them to their knees She's in the one by the riverbank, so it's easier for her to drown you And she claims, oh, she claims It's only the truth she holds in her hands Yes, it's only the truth she holds in her hands
