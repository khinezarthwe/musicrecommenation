I am thinking it's a signThat the freckles in our eyesAre mirror imagesAnd when we kiss they're perfectly alignedAnd I have to speculateThat God Himself did makeUs into corresponding shapesLike puzzle pieces from the clayAnd true, it may seem like a stretchBut it's thoughts like this that catchMy troubled head when you're awayWhen I am missing you to deathWhen you are out there on the roadFor several weeks of showsAnd when you scan the radioI hope this song will guide you home.They will see us waving from such great heights"Come down now" they'll sayBut everything looks perfect from far away"Come down now" but we'll stayI tried my best to leaveThis all on your machineBut the persistent beatIt sounded thin upon listening.And that frankly will not flyYou'll hear the shrillest highsAnd lowest lows with the windows downwhile this is guiding you home.They will see us waving from such great heights"Come down now" they'll sayBut everything looks perfect from far away"Come down now" but we'll stayThey will see us waving from such great heights"Come down now" they'll sayBut everything looks perfect from far away"Come down now" but we'll stayThey will see us waving from such great heights"Come down now" they'll sayBut everything looks perfect from far away"Come down now" but we'll stay
