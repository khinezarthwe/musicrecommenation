Did you sweep us far from your feetReset in stone this stark beliefSalted eyes and a soiled dyeToo many yearsBut don't despair, this day will be their damnedest dayOoh, if you take these things from meDid you feed us tales of deceitConceal the tongues who need to speakSubtle lies and a soiled queenThe truth is sold, the deal is doneBut don't despair, this day will be their damnedest dayOoh, if you take these things from meUndefied, no signs of regretYour swollen pride assumes respectTalons fly as a last disguiseBut no return, the time has comeSo don't despair, this day will be their damnedest dayOoh, if you take these things from meOoh, if you take these things from me
