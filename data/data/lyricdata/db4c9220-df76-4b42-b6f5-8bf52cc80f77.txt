One night to be confusedOne night to speed up truthWe had a promise madeFour hands and then awayBoth under influenceWe had divine senseTo know what to sayMind is a razor bladeTo call for hands of above, to lean onWouldn't be good enough for me, noOne night of magic rushThe start: a simple touchOne night to push and screamAnd then reliefTen days of perfect tunesThe colors red and blueWe had a promise madeWe were in loveTo call for hands of above, to lean onWouldn't be good enough for me, ohTo call for hands of above, to lean onWouldn't be good enough for meAnd youYou knew the hand of the devilAnd youKept us awake with wolves' teethSharing different heartbeats in one nightTo call for hands of above, to lean onWouldn't be good enough for meTo call for hands of above, to lean onWouldn't be good enough for me
