Wanna be by yourself and no-one else, alright. (al-al-al-al-alright) And you wanna go out, wanna scream and shout tonight. (to-to-to-to-tonight) You want some space, like get out of my face, alright. (al-al-al-al-alright)and you want me back, put your life on track tonight. (to-to-to-to-tonight) You're a needy girl, I can tell when I look in your big brown eyes. You want my world, but how can I do yours if i can't do mine? I try to change but somehow I always feel I don't feel the same. It's all about what you want, what you say, how you feel, how you play the game. You're a needy girl, and you want my world. I try to change, knowing it's not the same. When you're home alone, you don't answer the phone, alright. (al-al-al-al-alright) But it's like a crime if I don't answer mine tonight. (to-to-to-to-tonight) So you've found a man, who's more than a friend, alright. (al-al-al-al-alright) But you still call me for T L C tonight. (to-to-to-to-tonight) You're a needy girl, I can tell when I look in your big brown eyes. You want my world, but how can I do yours if i can't do mine? I try to change but somehow I always feel I don't feel the same. It's all about what you want, what you say, how you feel, how you play the game. You're a needy girl, and you want my world. I try to change, knowing it's not the same.
