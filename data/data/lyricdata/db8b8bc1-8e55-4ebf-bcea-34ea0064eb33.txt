Come on down and see the idiot right hereToo fucked to beg and not afraid to careWhat's the matter with calamity anyway?Right? Get the fuck outta my faceUnderstand that I can't feel anythingIt isn't like I wanna sift through the decayI feel like a wound, like I've got a fuckingGun against my head, you live when I'm dead!Everybody hates me now, so fuck it...Blood's on my face and my hands and I don't know whyI'm not afraid to cry, but that's none of your business!Whose life is it? Get it? See it? Feel it? Eat it!Spin it around so I can spit in its faceI wanna leave without a traceCause I don't wanna die in this place!It never stops, you can't be everything to everyoneContagion; I'm sitting at the side of SatanWhat do you want from me?They never told me the failure I was meant to beYeah? Overdo it; Don't tell me; You blew it?Stop your bitching and fight your way through itI'm not like you, I just fuck upCome on motherfucker, everybody has to dieCome on motherfucker, everybody has to die!
