I've been dragging aroundFrom the end of your coat for two weeksEverywhere you go is swirlingEverything you say has water under itYou know I keep your fingerprintsIn a pink folder in the middle of my tableYou're the tall kingdom I surroundThink I better follow you aroundYou might need me moreThan you think you willCome home in the car you loveBrainy, brainy, brainyI've been dragging aroundFrom the end of your coat for two weeksYou keep changing your fancy, fancy mindEvery time I decide to let it goI was up all night againBoning up and reading the American dictionaryYou'll never believe me what I foundThink I better follow you aroundYou might need me moreThan you think you willCome home in the car you loveBrainy, brainy, brainyYou might need me moreThan you think you willCome home in the car you loveBrainy, brainy, brainy
