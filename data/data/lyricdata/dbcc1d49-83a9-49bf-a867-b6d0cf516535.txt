Knock, knock Call the ghost in your underwear Call the ghost in your underwear "boo" It's fine, all right, you can stay the night, But please be gone by next morning's light. Oh, please don't pout, don't cause a scene Oh, babygirl, don't be mad at me! Every summer you disappear It's hot as balls I must repeat: I think you're sweet But ain't no way that I'm gonna meet Your mother, your father, Your dog or your brother, Your nephew and niece, girl, I just can't be bothered. Hit the heartbrakes. Hit the heartbrakes. Hit the heartbrakes. Hit the heartbrakes, baby, You're driving me crazy.
