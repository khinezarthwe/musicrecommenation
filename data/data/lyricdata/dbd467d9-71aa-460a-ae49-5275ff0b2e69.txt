I love men who are not the same Bathroom singers with no name Sex machines, old school babe Disco dancers in their game I love men: every kind They're so cute when they smile Thinking love is not a crime Walking in the sunshine I love men when they love me I feel the only one to be It's a power so crazy The most stupid lyrics you never hear I love men like Bobby Orlando The flirts composer a long time ago It makes me laugh a lot, you know But I don't want to show I love men who feel unique Especially in the musique When their ego becomes too big I disappear pretty quick I love men, I leave them I'm a bitch in the system But I'm really not to blame Because love is always the same
