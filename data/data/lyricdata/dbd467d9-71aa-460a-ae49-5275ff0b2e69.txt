I love men who are not the sameBathroom singers with no nameSex machines, old school babeDisco dancers in their gameI love men: every kindThey're so cute when they smileThinking love is not a crimeWalking in the sunshineI love men when they love meI feel the only one to beIt's a power so crazyThe most stupid lyrics you never hearI love men like Bobby OrlandoThe flirts composer a long time agoIt makes me laugh a lot, you knowBut I don't want to showI love men who feel uniqueEspecially in the musiqueWhen their ego becomes too bigI disappear pretty quickI love men, I leave themI'm a bitch in the systemBut I'm really not to blameBecause love is always the same
