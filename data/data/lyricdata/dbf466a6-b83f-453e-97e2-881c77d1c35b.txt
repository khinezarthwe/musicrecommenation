Fed up of girls in pretty dressesWith boys who want to teach them a lessonSick of the sight of my old loverWent under sheets and covers to get away from himHe can't see what it once meant to meI think it's time I put him out of my mindSo I took a glimpse of MontanaNow nothing else mattersI'll heal eventuallyHow I adore you Dory PrevinTurned you up to eleven for the band's ears to bleedI can't see what he once meant to meDo you think it's time I put it out of my mind?Do you think it's time I put it out of my mind?I can't see what he once meant to meDo you think it's time I put it out of my mind?I can't see what he once meant to meDo you think it's time I put it out of my mind?I can't see what he once meant to meDo you think it's time I put it out of my mind?I can't see what he once meant to meDo you think it's time I put it out of my mind?I think it's time I let my love for him die
