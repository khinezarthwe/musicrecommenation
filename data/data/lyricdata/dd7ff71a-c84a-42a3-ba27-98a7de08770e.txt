I walked across an empty landI knew the pathway like the back of my handI felt the earth beneath my feetSat by the river and it made me completeOh simple thing where have you gone?I'm getting old and I need something to rely onSo tell me when you're gonna let me inI'm getting tired and I need somewhere to beginI came across a fallen treeI felt the branches of it looking at meIs this the place we used to love?Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?Oh simple thing where have you gone?I'm getting old and I need something to rely onSo tell me when you're gonna let me inI'm getting tired and I need somewhere to beginAnd if you have a minute why don't we goTalk about it somewhere only we know?This could be the end of everythingSo why don't we goSomewhere only we know?Somewhere only we know?Oh simple thing where have you gone?I'm getting old and I need something to rely onSo tell me when you're gonna let me inI'm getting tired and I need somewhere to beginAnd if you have a minute why don't we goTalk about it somewhere only we know?This could be the end of everythingSo why don't we goSo why don't we goThis could be the end of everythingSo why don't we goSomewhere only we know?Somewhere only we know?Somewhere only we know?
