Sad how you've been all lead astray. Go on count your chins. Wolves are all lined up waiting. A trick is to not move. Showing off with jewelry. Humiliation will be your new rule. Time to send someone away,not me I'm not in. Sad how you've been all lead astray. They lead you to their mazewhen no ones asked them to. But hey you're walking over bodiesjust to witness something new. Just to witness something new. Time to send someone away,not me I'm not in. Feel that summer rain, it's in your face again. Feel that summer rain, it's in your face again
