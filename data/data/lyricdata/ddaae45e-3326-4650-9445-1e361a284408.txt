Patience, shadowWith all your sight there's no sight to seeLittle shadow, little shadowTo the night, will you follow me?Pardon, shadow, hold on tight to your darkened keyLittle shadow, little shadowTo the night, will you follow me?Closer, shadow, volume strikesStill we're caught between all this sorrow, little shadowTo the night, will you follow me?Hey, shadow, stars, break of dawnTake a turn for stars, to my fantasyLittle shadow, to the night, will you follow me?Little shadow, to the night, will you follow me?
