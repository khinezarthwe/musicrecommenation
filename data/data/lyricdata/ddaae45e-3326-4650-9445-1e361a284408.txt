Patience, shadow With all your sight there's no sight to see Little shadow, little shadow To the night, will you follow me? Pardon, shadow, hold on tight to your darkened key Little shadow, little shadow To the night, will you follow me? Closer, shadow, volume strikes Still we're caught between all this sorrow, little shadow To the night, will you follow me? Hey, shadow, stars, break of dawn Take a turn for stars, to my fantasy Little shadow, to the night, will you follow me? Little shadow, to the night, will you follow me?
