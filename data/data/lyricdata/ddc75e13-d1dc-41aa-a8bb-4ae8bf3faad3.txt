The beats yeah, they were coming out the speakersAnd were winding up straight in your sneakersAnd I'm dancing like every song he spins is bisOr like all my dance heroes would if they existedAnd yeah it's sad that you think that we're all just scenestersAnd even if we were its not the scene you're thinking ofTo taking props from nineties boy band fashionsAll crop tops and testosterone passionIf there's one thing that I could never confessIt's that I can't dance a single stepIt's you, it's meAnd there's dancingIt's you, it's meAnd there's dancingNot sure if you mind if I dance with youBut I don't think right now you care about anything at allIf only there were clothes on the floorI'd feel for certain I was bedroom dancingAnd it's all flailing limbs at the front lineEvery single one of us is twisted by designAnd dispatches from the back of my mindSays as long as we're here everything is alrightIf there's one thing that I could never confessIt's that I can't dance a single stepIt's you, it's meAnd there's dancingIt's you, it's meAnd there's dancingIf there's one thing that I could never confessIt's that I can't dance a single stepOne thing that I could never confessIt's that I can't dance a single stepIt's you, it's meAnd there's dancingIt's you, it's meAnd there's dancingIt's you, it's meAnd there's dancingIt's you, it's meAnd there's dancingAnd I always get confused,because in supermarkets they turn the lights off when they want you to leave,but in discos they turn them on.And it's always sad to go, but it's never that sad,Because there's only so many places you're guaranteed of getting a hug when you leave.And then on the way home, it always seems like a good idea to go paddling in the fountain, and that's because it IS a good idea.And were just like, how Rousseau depicts man in the state of nature:we're undeveloped, we're ignorant, we're stupid, but we're happy.
