The beats yeah, they were coming out the speakers And were winding up straight in your sneakers And I'm dancing like every song he spins is bis Or like all my dance heroes would if they existed And yeah it's sad that you think that we're all just scenesters And even if we were its not the scene you're thinking of To taking props from nineties boy band fashions All crop tops and testosterone passion If there's one thing that I could never confess It's that I can't dance a single step It's you, it's me And there's dancing It's you, it's me And there's dancing Not sure if you mind if I dance with you But I don't think right now you care about anything at all If only there were clothes on the floor I'd feel for certain I was bedroom dancing And it's all flailing limbs at the front line Every single one of us is twisted by design And dispatches from the back of my mind Says as long as we're here everything is alright If there's one thing that I could never confess It's that I can't dance a single step It's you, it's me And there's dancing It's you, it's me And there's dancing If there's one thing that I could never confess It's that I can't dance a single step One thing that I could never confess It's that I can't dance a single step It's you, it's me And there's dancing It's you, it's me And there's dancing It's you, it's me And there's dancing It's you, it's me And there's dancing And I always get confused,because in supermarkets they turn the lights off when they want you to leave,but in discos they turn them on. And it's always sad to go, but it's never that sad, Because there's only so many places you're guaranteed of getting a hug when you leave. And then on the way home, it always seems like a good idea to go paddling in the fountain, and that's because it I S a good idea. And were just like, how Rousseau depicts man in the state of nature:we're undeveloped, we're ignorant, we're stupid, but we're happy.
