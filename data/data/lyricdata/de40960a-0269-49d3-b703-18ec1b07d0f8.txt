Called to seeIf your back was still alignedAnd your sheetsWere growing grass all on the corners of your bedBut you've got too much to wear on your sleevesIt has too much to do with meAnd secretly, I want to bury in the yardThe gray remains of a friendship scarredYou told us of your new life thereYou've got someone comin' aroundGluing tinsel to your crownHe's got you talking pretty loudYou berate, remember your ailing heart and your criminal eyesYou say you're still in loveIf it's true, what can be done?It's hard to leave all these moments behindCalled to seeIf your back was still alignedAnd your sheetsWere growing grass all on the corners of your bedBut you've got too much to wear on your sleevesIt has too much to do with meAnd secretly, I want to bury in the yardThe gray remains of a friendship scarredYou tested your mettleOn doe skin and petalsWhile kissing the liplessWho bleed all the sweetness away
