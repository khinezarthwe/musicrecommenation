Pain! Buried so far away. Into my life of nothing. Sick of the same old thing So I dig a hole, bury pain! Sick of the same old thing So I dig a hole, bury pain! I am so high always. Burying my life so slowly. Sick of the same old thing So I dig a hole, bury pain! Sick of the same old thing So I dig a hole, bury pain! Sick of the same old thing So I dig a hole, bury pain! Sick of the same old thing So I dig a hole, bury pain! It opens my mind to feelings. Can't face boredom without something. Sick of the same old thing So I dig a hole, bury pain! Sick of the same old thing So I dig a hole, bury pain! Sick of the same old thing So I dig a hole, bury pain! Sick of the same old thing So I dig a hole, bury pain! Re-entering my head, Feeling like I'm God With the world around me. Can't you feel this pain? Reaming through my heart! Screaming through my veins! Nothing I can kill! Screaming a Lie I Am Can't you tear My Eyes Out? Can't you take my heart? Away To heart Good-bye Sick of the same old thing So I dig a hole, bury pain! Sick of the same old thing So I dig a hole, bury pain! Sick of the same old thing So I dig a hole, bury pain! Sick of the same old thing So I dig a hole, bury pain! Pain. Pain. Pain. Pain. Pain.
