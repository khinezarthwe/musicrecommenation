Where would you go? A-not long ago I've been thinking out loud Why so suddenly? D-d-don't you know? Don't do it What you do Oh, what you do to me Forever is a long, long time When you've lost your way Trying to follow your ideals Oh, sorry but your so-called life It is such a waste Wear your real eyes No, you don't realize What you say yes to But you say yes too A-where would you go Where would you go With a lasso? Could you run into Could you run into Could you go and run into me? A-where would you go Where would you go Tied up to a lasso? Could you run into Could you run into Could you go and run into me? So lonely, so pretty Such a lack of diplomacy You can't get out D-d-don't you know don't do it What you do, well, you should do to me Far-out, so far-out Such a fall-out Not only that you're lonely Don't matter not so well No, you're not so well Where would you go Where would you go With a lasso? Could you run into Could you run into Could you go and run into me? A-where would you go Where would you go Tied up to a lasso? Could you run into Could you run into Could you go and run into me? Wear your real eyes No, you don't realize What you say yes to But you say yes too Tomorrow is a long long time When you've lost your way Tomorrow is a long long time When you've lost your way( When you've lost your way)
