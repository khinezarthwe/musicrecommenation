Threw my bad fortune Off the top of A tall building I'd rather have done it with you Your boy's smile Five in the morning Looked into your eyes And I was really in love In Chinatown Hung over You showed me Just what I could do Talkin about Time travel And the meaning And just what it was worth And I feel like some bird of paradise My bad fortune slipping away And I feel the innocence of a child Everybody's got something good to say Things I once thought Unbelievable In my life Have all taken place When we walked through Little Italy I saw my reflection Come right off your face I paint pictures To remember You're too beautiful To put it into words Like a gypsy You dance in circles All around me And all over the world And I feel like some bird of paradise My bad fortune slipping away And I feel the innocence of a child Everybody's got something good to say And I feel like some bird of paradise My bad fortune slipping away And I feel the innocence of a child Everybody's got something good to say So I take my good fortune And I fantasise of our leaving Like some modern-day Gypsy landslide Like some modern-day Bonnie and Clyde On the run again (on the run again) On the run again (on the run again) On the run again (on the run again) On the run again (on the run again)
