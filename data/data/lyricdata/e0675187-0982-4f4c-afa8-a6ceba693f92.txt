Threw my bad fortuneOff the top ofA tall buildingI'd rather have done it with youYour boy's smileFive in the morningLooked into your eyesAnd I was really in loveIn ChinatownHung overYou showed meJust what I could doTalkin aboutTime travelAnd the meaningAnd just what it was worthAnd I feel like some bird of paradiseMy bad fortune slipping awayAnd I feel the innocence of a childEverybody's got something good to sayThings I once thoughtUnbelievableIn my lifeHave all taken placeWhen we walked throughLittle ItalyI saw my reflectionCome right off your faceI paint picturesTo rememberYou're too beautifulTo put it into wordsLike a gypsyYou dance in circlesAll around meAnd all over the worldAnd I feel like some bird of paradiseMy bad fortune slipping awayAnd I feel the innocence of a childEverybody's got something good to sayAnd I feel like some bird of paradiseMy bad fortune slipping awayAnd I feel the innocence of a childEverybody's got something good to saySo I take my good fortuneAnd I fantasise of our leavingLike some modern-dayGypsy landslideLike some modern-dayBonnie and ClydeOn the run again (on the run again)On the run again (on the run again)On the run again (on the run again)On the run again (on the run again)
