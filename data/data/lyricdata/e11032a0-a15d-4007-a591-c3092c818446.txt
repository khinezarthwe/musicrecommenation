I saw love die in the fire in you I saw the love being crushed a thousand feet below I saw the rage rising in the morning sky I saw the violence in each tear their families cried Each one event brings it to me Which one effect brings it to me? Wait, watch, infect brings it to me In time affects Violence Bring it to me, or I will bring in the end of creation Bring it to me, violence Or I will bring in the death of your nation Bring it to me, violence Or I will bring in the end of creation Bring it to me, violence Or I will bring in the death of this world that we live in
