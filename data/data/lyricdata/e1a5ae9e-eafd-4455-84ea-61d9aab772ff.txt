Let's dance little strangerShow me secret sinsLove can be like bondageSeduce me once againBurning like an angelWho has heaven in reprieveBurning like the voodoo manWith devils on his sleeveWon't you dance with me?In my world of fantasyWon't you dance with me?Ritual fertilityLike an apparitionYou don't seem real at allLike a premonitionOf curses on my soulThe way I want to love youWell it could be against the lawI've seen you in a thousand mindsYou've made the angels fallWon't you dance with me?In my world of fantasyWon't you dance with me?Ritual fertilityCome on little strangerThere's only one last danceSoon the music's overLet's give it one more chanceWon't you dance with me?In my world of fantasyWon't you dance with me?Ritual fertilityTake a chance with meIn my world of fantasyWon't you dance with meRitual fertility
