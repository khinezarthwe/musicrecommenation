Eternal life is now on my trailGot my red glitter coffin, manJust need one last nailWhile all these ugly gentlemen play out their foolish gamesThere's a flaming red horizon that screams our namesAnd as your fantasies are broken in twoDid you really think this bloody road would pave the way for you?You better turn aroundAnd blow your kiss hello to life eternal, AngelRacist everyman, what have you done?Man, you've made a killer of your unborn sonCrown my fear your king at the point of a gunAll I want to do is love everyoneAnd as your fantasies are broken in twoDid you really think this bloody road would pave the way for you?You better turn aroundAnd blow your kiss hello to life eternalOhThere's no time for hatredOnly questionsWhere is love?Where is happiness?What is life?Where is peace?When will I find the strength to bring me release?And tell me where is the love in what your prophet has said?Man, It sounds to me just like a prison for the walking deadAnd I've got a message for you and your twisted hellYou better turn around and blow your kiss goodbyeTo life eternal AngelAngel
