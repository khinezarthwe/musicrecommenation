And what costume shall the poor girl wearTo all tomorrow's parties?A hand-me-down dress from who knows whereTo all tomorrow's partiesAnd where will she go, and what shall she doWhen midnight comes around?She'll turn once more to Sunday's clownAnd cry behind the doorAnd what costume shall the poor girl wearTo all tomorrow's parties?Why silks and linens of yesterday's gownsTo all tomorrow's partiesAnd what will she do with Thursday's ragsWhen Monday comes around?She'll turn once more to Sunday's clownAnd cry behind the doorAnd what costume shall the poor girl wearTo all tomorrow's parties?For Thursday's child is Sunday's clownFor whom none will go mourningA blackened shroud, a hand-me-down gownOf rags and silks, a costumeFit for one who sits and criesFor all tomorrow's parties
