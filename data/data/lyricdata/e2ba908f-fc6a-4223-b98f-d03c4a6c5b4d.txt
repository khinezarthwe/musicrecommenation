Where am I tonight?My hotel room won't remember meAnd this dream will die, die by morningAnd this dream will not remember meAwakened by a droning voice"I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes"Is it a lady? Or is it a man?Humming helicopters through the blades of a fanI love your long shadows and your gun powder eyesI love your long shadows and your gun powder eyesOn my feet to chase it downThe light switch spooks and runs awayI stumble back and hit the floorLong shadows crawl beneath the doorTo a passageSo poorly litThere are moths flying away from itWho am I tonight?My hotel room won't remember meFrom darkness enter prison girlsPushing mops and kicking pailsNow's my chance, I clasp my chestAnd declare unto my audience"I love your long shadows and your gun powder eyes""I love your long shadows and your gun powder eyes"The prison girls are not impressedThey're the ones who have to clean this messThey've traded more for cigarettes than I have managedTo expressFiling pastMiles longMy cheek is frozen to the floorThe prison girls have filled their bedsTheir thoughts to dry above their heads(I'll wear them in the morning)I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyesI love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyesI love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyesI love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyesI love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyesI love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes
