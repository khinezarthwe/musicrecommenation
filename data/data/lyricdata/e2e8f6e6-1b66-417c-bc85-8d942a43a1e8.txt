Dreaming again of a train track ending at the edge of the sea Dog at the barbed wire barking at my buzz cut friends and me No one on the corner had a quarter for the telephone Everybody bitching, there's nothing on the radio Dreaming again of a city full of fathers in their army clothes All of us lost at the crosswalk waiting for the other to go Someone bet a dollar that my daddy wasn't coming home Everybody bitching, there's nothing on the radio Dreaming again that it's freezing and my mother's in her flowerbed Changing her face like a shadow on the gravel, this is what she said No one lives forever and the devil never sleeps alone Everybody bitching, there's nothing on the radio
