Dreaming again of a train track ending at the edge of the seaDog at the barbed wire barking at my buzz cut friends and meNo one on the corner had a quarter for the telephoneEverybody bitching, there's nothing on the radioDreaming again of a city full of fathers in their army clothesAll of us lost at the crosswalk waiting for the other to goSomeone bet a dollar that my daddy wasn't coming homeEverybody bitching, there's nothing on the radioDreaming again that it's freezing and my mother's in her flowerbedChanging her face like a shadow on the gravel, this is what she saidNo one lives forever and the devil never sleeps aloneEverybody bitching, there's nothing on the radio
