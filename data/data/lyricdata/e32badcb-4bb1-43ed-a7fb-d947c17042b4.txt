On my way up north, up on the VenturaI pulled back the hood and I was talking to youAnd I knew then it would be a life long thingBut I didn't know that we, we could break a silver liningAnd I'm so sadLike a good book I can't put this day backA sorta fairytale with youA sorta fairytale with youThings you said that day up on the 101The girl had come undone, I tried to downplay itWith a bet about us, you said that you'd take itAs long as I could, I could not erase itAnd I'm so sadLike a good book I can't put this day backA sorta fairytale with youA sorta fairytale with youAnd I ride along sideAnd I rode along side you thenAnd I rode along sideTill you lost me there in the open roadAnd I rode along sideTill the honey spread itself so thinFor me to break your breadFor me to take your wordI had to steal itAnd I'm so sadLike a good book I can't put this day backA sorta fairytale with youA sorta fairytale with youI could pick back up whenever I feelDown New Mexico waySomething about the open roadI knew that he wasLooking for some Indian bloodAnd find a little in youFind a little in meWe may be on this roadBut we're just impostors in this country you knowSo we go along and we said we'd fake itFeel better with Oliver StoneTill I almost smacked himSeemed right that nightI don't know what takes holdOut there in the desert coldThese guys think they mustTry and just get over on usAnd I'm so sadlike a good book I can't put this day backA sorta fairytale with youA sorta fairytale with youAnd I was riding byRiding along sideFor a while till you lost meAnd I was riding byRiding along till you lost meTill you lost me in the rear viewYou lost me I saidWay up north I took my dayAll in all was a pretty nice dayAnd I put the hood right back whereYou could taste heaven perfectlyFeel out the summer breezeDidn't know when we'd be backAnd I, I don't, didn't thinkWe'd end up like, like this
