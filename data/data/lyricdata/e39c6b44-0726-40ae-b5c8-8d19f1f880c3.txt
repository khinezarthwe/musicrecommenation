You light up another cigaretteand I pour the wine It's four o'clock in the morningand it's starting to get lightnow I'm right where I want to belosing track of timebut I wish that it was still last night You look like you're in another worldbut I can read your mindhow can you be so far awaylying by my sidewhen I go away I'll miss youand I will be thinking of youevery night and day just ... Promise me you'll wait for me'cos I'll be saving all my love for youand I will be home soon Promise me you'll wait for me I need to know you feel the same way tooand I'll be home, I'll be home soon When I go away I'll miss youand I will be thinking of youevery night and day just ... Promise me you'll wait for me'cos I'll be saving all my love for youand I will be home soon Promise me you'll wait for me I need to know you feel the same way tooand I'll be home, I'll be home Promise me you'll wait for me'cos I'll be saving all my love for youand I will be home soon Promise me you'll wait for me I need to know you feel the same way tooand I'll be home, I'll be home soon
