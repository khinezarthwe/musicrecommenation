I cannot make youUnderstand my soulBy 18 it goldFrom echoing rainbowsWhat have we becomeAnd what seems only daysThoughts and world of harmsWe want out of this mazeSo look us in the eyesDon't take yes or noThere's no surprise hereThere's nothing we won't showPlease wait a while for meIt will not take longWe will be right where we need to beSing a chosen songThey will appear (x2) Oh they'll!They will appear (x2) Oh they'll!A horse station will appearA Philippine nation will appearAnd they will appear behold (x3) Oh they'll!A horse station will appearA geese nation will appearA buffalo nation will appearAn evil core evil big shot
