I cannot make you Understand my soul By 18 it gold From echoing rainbows What have we become And what seems only days Thoughts and world of harms We want out of this maze So look us in the eyes Don't take yes or no There's no surprise here There's nothing we won't show Please wait a while for me It will not take long We will be right where we need to be Sing a chosen song They will appear (x2) Oh they'll! They will appear (x2) Oh they'll! A horse station will appear A Philippine nation will appear And they will appear behold (x3) Oh they'll! A horse station will appear A geese nation will appear A buffalo nation will appear An evil core evil big shot
