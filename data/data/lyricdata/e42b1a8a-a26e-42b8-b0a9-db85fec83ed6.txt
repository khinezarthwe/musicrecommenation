In the night time we are foundMisty sorrow swoop unboundWhisper you mean it, say you'll stayHold my heart till brighter daysNow I am searching how to get aloneThis queen of heart's dancing on her throneBut I need sorrow, baby, life's sorrow is the drugSo will I ever find that place they call good love?Good lovePassed it last night in a dreamGood loveAnd my heart caught fireI drove past true love once, in a dreamLike a house that caught fire, it burned and flamedThen the magician disappeared as quickly as he cameAnd with a sound like white magic caught in a black car's blazing trailThe house set fire to my heartLike an inferno we shone raysI swallowed the sun in your formI woke up and you were cryingI woke up and you were sayingGood lovePassed it last night in a dreamGood loveCause my heart caught fireGood lovePassed it last night in a dreamGood loveCause my heart caught fire
