Sittin' on my own, chewin' on a boneA thousand million miles from home whenSomething hit meSomewhere right between the eyesSleepin' on a plane, you know you can't complainYou took your last chance once again, ILanded strandedHardly even knew your nameI wanna talk tonightUntil the mornin' light'Bout how you saved my lifeAnd you and me see how we areYou and me see how we areAll your dreams are made of strawberry lemonadeAnd you make sure I eat today, youTake me walkingTo where you played when you were youngI'll never say that I won't ever make you cryAnd this I say, I don't know why IKnow I'm leavingBut I'll be back another dayI wanna talk tonightUntil the mornin' light'Bout how you saved my lifeI wanna talk tonight'Bout how you saved my life'Bout how you saved my life'Bout how you saved my life'Bout how you saved my life
