Got woken in the nightBy a mystic, golden lightMy head soaked in river waterI had been dressed in a coat of armourThey called a horse out of the woodland"Take her there, through the desert shores"They sang to me, "This is yours to wear""You're the chosen one, there's no turning back now"The smell of redwood giantsA banquet for the shadowsHorse and IWe're dancers in the darkCame upon a headdressIt was gilded, dark and goldenThe children sangI was so afraidI took it to my head and prayedThere is no turning backThere is no turnThere is no turning backThere is no turnThere is no turning backThere is no turn
