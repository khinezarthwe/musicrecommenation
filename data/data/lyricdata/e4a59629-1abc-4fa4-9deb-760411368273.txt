Lovers, keep on the road you're onRunners, until the race is runSoldiers, you've got to soldier onSometimes even the right is wrongThey are turning my head outTo see what I'm all aboutKeeping my head downTo see what it feels like nowBut I have no doubtOne day, we're gonna get outTonight, maybe we're gonna runDreaming of the Osaka sunOhohohoh ohohohoh ohDreaming of when the morning comesThey are turning my head outTo see what I'm all aboutKeeping my head downTo see what it feels like nowBut I have no doubtOne day, the sun will come outReign of loveI can't let goTo the sea I offer this heavy loadLocust windLift me upI'm just a prisoner in a reign of loveLocust windLet us stopHow I wish I'd spoken upTo a reign of loveReign of love by the church we're waitingReign of love on my knees go prayingHow I wish I'd spoken upAway get carried on a reign of love
