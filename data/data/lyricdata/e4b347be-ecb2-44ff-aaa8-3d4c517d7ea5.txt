Welcome to your lifeThere's no turning backEven while we sleepWe will find you acting on your best behaviorTurn your back on Mother NatureEverybody wants to rule the worldIt's my own designIt's my own remorseHelp me to decideHelp me make the most of freedom and of pleasureNothing ever lasts foreverEverybody wants to rule the worldThere's a room where the light won't find youHolding hands while the walls come tumbling downWhen they do, I'll be right behind youSo glad we've almost made itSo sad they had to fade itEverybody wants to rule the worldI can't stand this indecisionMarried with a lack of visionEverybody wants to rule the worldSay that you'll never, never, never, never need itOne headline, why believe it?Everybody wants to rule the worldAll for freedom and for pleasureNothing ever lasts foreverEverybody wants to rule the world
