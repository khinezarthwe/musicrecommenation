What a night for a dance, you know I'm a dancing machineWith the fire in my bones and the sweet taste of keroseneI get lost in the night, so high I don't want to come downTo face the loss of the good thing that I had foundWoo hoo hooWoo hoo hooIn the dark of the night, I can hear you calling my nameWith the hardest of hearts I still feel full of painSo I drink and I smoke, and I ask you if you're ever aroundEven though it was me who drove us right in the groundSee, the time we shared, it was precious to meBut all the while, I was dreaming of revelryBorn to run, baby, run like a stream down a mountainsideWith the wind at my back, I don't ever even bat an eyeJust know it was you all along who had a hold of my heartBut the demon and me were the best of friends from the startSo the time we shared, it was precious to meAll the while I was dreaming of revelryDreaming of revelryAnd I told myself, "Boy, away you go."It rained so hard, it felt like snowEverything came tumbling down on meIn the back of the woods, in the dark of the nightThe paleness of the old moonlightEverything just felt so incompleteDreaming of revelryDreaming of revelryDreaming of revelryDreaming of revelry
