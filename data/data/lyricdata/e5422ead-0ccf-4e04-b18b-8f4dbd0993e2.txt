There's flowers in my house and I bought them myself No surprises in the record collection, you must have thought I was someone else I'm still afraid to get lost, in a city I might explore But I'm not afraid to have an eloquent boy at my door At my door, at my door, at my door Oh you want to be a writer - fantastic idea You say you've never seen America, I really think you'll like it there Maybe you should travel with me, is this the best idea? Because you've never seen a Redwood and you've never touched a deer A deer, a deer, dear, a deer, a deer, my dear Are swans deceiving us all? Oh, I for one should know I never felt myself so graceful and I never swam so slow So slow, so slow, so slow
