How could he know this new dawn's lightWould change his life forever?Set sail to sea but pulled off courseBy the light of golden treasureWas he the one causing painWith his careless dreaming?Been afraid, always afraidOf the things he's feelingHe could just be goneHe would just sail onHe'll just sail onHow can I be lostIf I've got nowhere to go?Search for seas of goldHow come it's got so cold?How can I be lostIn remembrance I relive?And how can I blame youWhen it's me I can't forgive?These days drift on inside a fogIt's thick and suffocatingThis sinking life, outside it's hellInside intoxicatingHe's run aground, like his lifeWater much too shallowSlipping fast, down with his shipFading in the shadowsNow a castawayThey've all gone awayThey've gone awayHow can I be lostIf I've got nowhere to go?Searched for seas of goldHow come it's got so cold?How can I be lostIn remembrance I relive?And how can I blame youWhen it's me I can't forgive?Forgive meForgive me notForgive meForgive me notForgive meForgive me notForgive meForgive me, why can't I forgive me?Set sail to sea but pulled off courseBy the light of golden treasureHow could he know this new dawn's lightWould change his life foreverHow can I be lostIf I've got nowhere to go?Search for seas of goldHow come it's got so cold?How can I be lostIn remembrance I relive?So how can I blame youWhen it's me I can't forgive?
