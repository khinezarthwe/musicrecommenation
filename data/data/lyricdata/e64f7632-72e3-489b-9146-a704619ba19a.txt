It's a God-awful small affairTo the girl with the mousy hairBut her mummy is yelling, "No!"And her daddy has told her to goBut her friend is nowhere to be seenNow she walks through her sunken dreamTo the seat with the clearest viewAnd she's hooked to the silver screenBut the film is a sadd'ning boreFor she's lived it ten times or moreShe could spit in the eyes of foolsAs they ask her to focus onSailors fighting in the dance hallOh, man! Look at those cavemen goIt's the freakiest showTake a look at the lawman beating up the wrong guyOh, man! Wonder if he'll ever knowWho's in the best-selling showIs there life on Mars?It's on America's tortured browThat Mickey Mouse has grown up a cowNow the workers have struck for fame'Cause Lennon's on sale againSee the mice in their million hordesFrom Ibiza to the Norfolk BroadsRule Britannia is out of boundsTo my mother, my dog, and clownsBut the film is a sadd'ning bore'Cause I wrote it ten times or moreIt's about to be writ againAs I ask you to focus onSailors fighting in the dance hallOh, man! Look at those cavemen goIt's the freakiest showTake a look at the lawman beating up the wrong guyOh, man! Wonder if he'll ever knowWho's in the best-selling showIs there life on Mars?
