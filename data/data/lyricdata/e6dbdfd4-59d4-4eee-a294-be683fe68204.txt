Looking out across the nighttimeThe city winks a sleepless eyeHear her voice shake my windowSweet seducing sighsGet me out into the nighttimeFour walls won't hold me tonightIf this town is just an appleThen let me take a biteIf they say, "Why? Why?"Tell 'em that is human nature"Why, why, does he do me that way?"If they say, "Why? Why?"Tell 'em that is human nature"Why, why, does he do me that way?"Reaching out to touch a strangerElectric eyes are ev'rywhereSee that girl, she knows I'm watchingShe likes the way I stareIf they say, "Why? Why?"Tell 'em that is human nature"Why, why, does he do me that way?"If they say, "Why? Why?"Tell 'em that is human nature"Why, why, does he do me that way?"I like livin' this wayI like lovin' this wayHow why whyHow why whyLooking out across the morningThe city's heart begins to beatReaching out, I touch her shoulderI'm dreaming of the streetIf they say, "Why? Why?"Tell 'em that is human nature"Why, why, does he do me that way?"If they say, "Why? Why?"Tell 'em that is human nature"Why, why, does he do me that way?"I like livin' this way yeahHow why whyHow why why
