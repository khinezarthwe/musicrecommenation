I've been driving all night, my hands wet on the wheel There's a voice in my head that drives my heel It's my baby calling, says " I need you here" And it's a half past four and I'm shifting gear When she is lonely and the longing gets too much She sends a cable coming in from above Don't need no phone at all We've got a thing that's called radar love We've got a wave in the air Radar love The radio is playing some forgotten song Brenda Lee's " Coming On Strong" The road has got me hypnotized And I'm speeding into a new sunrise When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough She sends her comfort coming in from above We don't need no letter at all We've got a thing that's called radar love We've got a line in the sky Radar love No more speed, I'm almost there Gotta keep cool now, gotta take care Last car to pass, here I go And the line of cars goes down real slow And the radio played that forgotten song Brenda Lee's " Coming On Strong" And the newsman sang his same song Oh, one more radar lover gone When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough She sends her comfort coming in from above We don't need no letter at all We've got a thing that's called radar love We've got a line in the sky We've got a thing that's called radar love We've got a thing that's called Radar love
