I've been driving all night, my hands wet on the wheelThere's a voice in my head that drives my heelIt's my baby calling, says "I need you here"And it's a half past four and I'm shifting gearWhen she is lonely and the longing gets too muchShe sends a cable coming in from aboveDon't need no phone at allWe've got a thing that's called radar loveWe've got a wave in the airRadar loveThe radio is playing some forgotten songBrenda Lee's "Coming On Strong"The road has got me hypnotizedAnd I'm speeding into a new sunriseWhen I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enoughShe sends her comfort coming in from aboveWe don't need no letter at allWe've got a thing that's called radar loveWe've got a line in the skyRadar loveNo more speed, I'm almost thereGotta keep cool now, gotta take careLast car to pass, here I goAnd the line of cars goes down real slowAnd the radio played that forgotten songBrenda Lee's "Coming On Strong"And the newsman sang his same songOh, one more radar lover goneWhen I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enoughShe sends her comfort coming in from aboveWe don't need no letter at allWe've got a thing that's called radar loveWe've got a line in the skyWe've got a thing that's called radar loveWe've got a thing that's calledRadar love
