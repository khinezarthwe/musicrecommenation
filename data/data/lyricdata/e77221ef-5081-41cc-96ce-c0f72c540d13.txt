When I was youngLying in the grassI felt so safeIn a warming bathOf sunlight, of sunlightVast open skyCould do no harmLike an embraceFrom Mother's armsIn sunlight, in sunlightIn sunlight, in sunlightWith every yearThat came to passMore clouds appearedTill the sky went blackAnd there was no sunlight, no sunlightAnd there was no sunlight, no sunlight anymoreIt disappeared at the same speedThe idealistic things I believedAnd the optimist died inside of meNo sunlight, no sunlightNo sunlight, no sunlightIt disappeared at the same speedThe idealistic things I believedAnd the optimist died inside of meNo sunlight, no sunlightNo sunlight, no sunlightNo sunlight, no sunlightNo sunlight, no sunlightNo sunlight anymore
