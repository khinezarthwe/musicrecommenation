When I came up from out of the meat-lockerThe city was goneThe sky was full of lightsThe snow provides a silent coverIn moonlandUnder the starsUnder the snowAnd I followed this carAnd I followed that carThrough the sandThrough the snowI turn on the radioI listen to the DJAnd it must feel niceIt must feel nice to knowThat somebody needs youAnd everything moves slowUnder the starsUnder the ashThrough the sandAnd the night drifts inThe snow provides a silent coverAnd I'm not your favourite loverI turn on the radioAnd it must feel niceWell, very very nice to knowThat somebody needs youAnd the chilly wind blowsUnder the snowUnder the starsThe whispering DJOn the radioThe whispering DJOn the radioI'm not your favourite loverI'm not your favourite loverAnd it must feel niceTo leave no trace(No trace at all)But somebody needs youAnd that somebody is meUnder the starsUnder the snowYour eyes were closedYou were playing with the buttons on your coatIn the back of that carIn moonlandUnder the starsIn moonlandI followed that car
