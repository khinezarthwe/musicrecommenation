I still don't know what I was waiting forAnd my time was running wildA million dead-end streets andEvery time I thought I'd got it madeIt seemed the taste was not so sweetSo I turned myself to face meBut I've never caught a glimpseOf how the others must see the fakerI'm much too fast to take that testCh-ch-ch-ch-changesTurn and face the strangeCh-ch-changesDon't want to be a richer manCh-ch-ch-ch-changesTurn and face the strangeCh-ch-changesJust gonna have to be a different manTime may change meBut I can't trace timeOoh yeahI watch the ripples change their sizeBut never leave the streamOf warm impermanence andSo the days float through my eyesBut still, the days seem the sameAnd these children that you spit onAs they try to change their worldsAre immune to your consultationsThey're quite aware what they're going throughCh-ch-ch-ch-changesTurn and face the strangeCh-ch-changesDon't tell them to grow up and out of itCh-ch-ch-ch-changesTurn and face the strangeCh-ch-changesWhere's your shame?You've left us up to our necks in itTime may change meBut you can't trace timeStrange fascination, fascinating meOh, changes are taking the pace I'm going throughCh-ch-ch-ch-changesTurn and face the strangeCh-ch-changesOh, look out you rock 'n' rollersCh-ch-ch-ch-changesTurn and face the strangeCh-ch-changesPretty soon now, you're gonna get olderTime may change meBut I can't trace timeI said that time may change meBut I can't trace time
