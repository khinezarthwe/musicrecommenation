Want her, have her Two years have gone now But I can't relate To the never ending games that you play As desire passes through Then you're open to the truth I hope you understand And your love Is standing next to me Is standing next to me The one you fell for Makes it seem juvenile And you laugh at yourself Again and again And weâ€™ll drink to the thoughts She'll remember you Maybe tomorrow And your love Is standing next to me Is standing next to me And your love Is standing next to me Is standing next to me Is standing next to me Is standing next to me Want her, have her Two years have gone now But I can't relate To the never ending games that you play As desire passes through Then you're open to the truth I hope you understand And your love Is standing next to me Is standing next to me Is standing next to me Is standing next to me
