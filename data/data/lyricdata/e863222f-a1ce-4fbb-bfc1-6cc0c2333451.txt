I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a boreIf I tell a joke, you've probably heard it beforeBut I have a talent, a wonderful thing'Cause everyone listens when I start to singI'm so grateful and proudAll I want is to sing it out loudSo I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singingThanks for all the joy they're bringingWho can live without it, I ask in all honestyWhat would life be without a song or a dance, what are we?So I say thank you for the musicFor giving it to meMother says I was a dancer before I could walkMmm-mmm, she says I began to sing long before I could talkAnd I've often wondered, how did it all start?Who found out that nothing can capture a heartLike a melody can?Well, whoever it was, I'm a fanSo I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singingThanks for all the joy they're bringingWho can live without it, I ask in all honestyWhat would life be without a song or a dance, what are we?So I say thank you for the musicFor giving it to meI've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hairI wanna sing it out to everybodyWhat a joy, what a life, what a chance!So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singingThanks for all the joy they're bringingWho can live without it, I ask in all honestyWhat would life be without a song or a dance, what are we?So I say thank you for the musicFor giving it to me
