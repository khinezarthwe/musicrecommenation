I cut your nails and comb your hairI carry you down the stairsI wanted to see right through from the other sideI wanted to walk a trail with no end in sightThe moment we believe that we have never metAnother kind of love it's easy to forgetWhen we are all alone then we do both agreeWe have a thing in common this was meant to beYou close my eyes and soothe my earsYou heal my wounds and dry my tearsOn the inside of this marble house I growAnd the seeds I sow will grow up prisoners tooThe moment we believe that we have never metAnother kind of love it's easy to forgetWhen we are all alone then we do both agreeWe have a thing in common this was meant to beNow where's your shoulderWhat is its nameWhat's your scentSay it againIf it goes faster can you still follow meIt must be safe when it's on TVI raise my hands to heaven for curiosityI don't know what to ask forWhat has it got for meThe others say we're hidingIt's as forward as can beSome things I do for moneySome things I do for free
