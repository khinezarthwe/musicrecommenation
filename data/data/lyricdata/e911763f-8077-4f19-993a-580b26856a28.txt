Sometimes I go whole dayslistening bored, half asleep I won't say anythingthat's worth a thing to me One day, suddenly, timetook a turn that once felt so brief I blinked to see polite ghosts fading quickly What begins as an unguardedtrain of thought slowly can becomean addiction to the slumberof disconnection and the resonanceof memory that no longer has a shapebut keeps you numb throughthe hours till gone is another day Be aware, my darlingthese things I say I meanare just traces of something I long to feel again I see our time expandin the air almost forcibly,spreading thinner till it dissolves completely
