Sometimes I go whole dayslistening bored, half asleepI won't say anythingthat's worth a thing to meOne day, suddenly, timetook a turn that once felt so briefI blinked to see polite ghosts fading quicklyWhat begins as an unguardedtrain of thought slowly can becomean addiction to the slumberof disconnection and the resonanceof memory that no longer has a shapebut keeps you numb throughthe hours till gone is another dayBe aware, my darlingthese things I say I meanare just traces of somethingI long to feel againI see our time expandin the air almost forcibly,spreading thinner till it dissolves completely
