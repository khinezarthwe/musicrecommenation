You know my darling, I can't stand to sleep aloneNo sweetheart in the dark to call my ownYou're my own, you're my own, I can sing it, I can groanBut the darkness is a stranger and I'm lonely, lonely, lonely, lowLast night's parties and last nights horrorshowSmiling and whirling and kissing all I knowGive my soul, give my soul, sing it free across the seaA lonely spell to conjure you, but conjure hell is all I doLonely, lonely, lonely, 'cause my mama told meThe dream of love is a two hearted dreamLonely, lonely, lonely, 'cause my mama told meThe dream of love is a two hearted dreamThey say for every high high there must be a low, low, low, low, lowFrom every sun ascending a lonesome moon will grow, grow, grow, growDrive my heart, drive my heart, into the fire of a burning heart's desireA lonely spell so you be seen, do you hear me coming in my blue dream?Lonely, lonely, lonely, 'cause my mama told meThe dream of love is a two hearted dreamLonely, lonely, lonely,The dream of love is a two hearted dream
