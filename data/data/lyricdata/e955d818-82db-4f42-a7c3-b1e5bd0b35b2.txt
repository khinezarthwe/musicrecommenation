And it came to me then That every plan Is a tiny prayer to Father Time As I stared at my shoes in the I C U That reeked of piss and 4- Oh-9 And I rationed my breaths as I said to myself That I'd already taken too much today As each descending peak on the L C D Took you a little farther away from me Away from me Amongst the vending machines and year-old magazines In a place where we only say goodbye It stung like a violent wind That our memories depend On a faulty camera in our minds And I knew that you were a truth I would rather lose Than to have never lain beside at all And I looked around At all the eyes on the ground As the T V entertained itself' Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room Just nervous pacers bracing for bad news Then the nurse comes round And everyone lifts their head But I'm thinking of what Sarah said:" Love is watching someone die." So who's gonna watch you die? So who's gonna watch you die? So who's gonna watch you die?
