And it came to me thenThat every planIs a tiny prayer to Father TimeAs I stared at my shoes in the ICUThat reeked of piss and 4-Oh-9And I rationed my breaths as I said to myselfThat I'd already taken too much todayAs each descending peak on the LCDTook you a little farther away from meAway from meAmongst the vending machines and year-old magazinesIn a place where we only say goodbyeIt stung like a violent windThat our memories dependOn a faulty camera in our mindsAnd I knew that you were a truthI would rather loseThan to have never lain beside at allAnd I looked aroundAt all the eyes on the groundAs the TV entertained itself'Cause there's no comfort in the waiting roomJust nervous pacers bracing for bad newsThen the nurse comes roundAnd everyone lifts their headBut I'm thinking of what Sarah said:"Love is watching someone die."So who's gonna watch you die?So who's gonna watch you die?So who's gonna watch you die?
