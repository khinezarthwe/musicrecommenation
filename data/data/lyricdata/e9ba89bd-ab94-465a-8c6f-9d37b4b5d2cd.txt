One night to be confusedOne night to speed up truthWe had a promise madeFour hands and then awayBoth under influenceWe had divine scentTo know what to sayMind is a razorbladeTo call for hands of aboveTo lean onWouldn't be good enoughFor me, noOne night of magic rushThe start a simple touchOne night to push and screamAnd then reliefTen days of perfect tunesThe colors red and blueWe had a promise madeWe were in loveTo call for hands of aboveTo lean onWouldn't be good enoughFor me, noTo call for hands of aboveTo lean onWouldn't be good enoughAnd you, you knew the hand of the devilAnd you, kept us awake with wolf's teethSharing different heartbeatsIn one nightTo call for hands of aboveTo lean onWouldn't be good enoughFor me, noTo call for hands of aboveTo lean onWouldn't be good enough
