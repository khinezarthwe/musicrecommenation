Here from a king's mountain view Here from the wild dream come true Feast like a sultan, I do On treasures and flesh, never few But I, I would wish it all away If I thought I'd lose you just one day The devil and his had me down In love with the dark side I'd found Dabblin' all the way down Up to my neck, soon to drown But you changed that all for me Lifted me up, turned me 'round So I, I, I, I I would, I would I would wish this all away Prayed like a martyr, dusk to dawn Begged like a hooker all night long Tempted the devil with my song And got what I wanted all along But I I would If I could I would Wish it away Wish it away Wish it all away Wanna wish it all away No prize that could hold sway Or justify my giving away my center So if I could, I'd wish it all away If I thought tomorrow would take you away You, my peace of mind, my all, my center... I'm just trying to hold on one more day Damn my eyes Damn my eyes Damn my eyes if they should compromise the fulcrum( If) Wants and needs divide me Then I might as well be gone Shine on forever Shine on, benevolent sun Shine down upon the broken Shine until the two become one Shine on forever Shine on, benevolent sun Shine down upon the severed Shine until the two become one Divided, I'm withering away Divided, I'm withering away Shine down upon the many Light our way, benevolent sun Breathe in union Breathe in union Breathe in union Breathe in union Breathe in union So as one, survive another day and season Silence legion, save your poison Silence legion, stay out of my way
