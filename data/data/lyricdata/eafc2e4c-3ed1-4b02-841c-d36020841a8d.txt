Outside another yellow moonHas punched a hole in the nighttime mistI climb to the window and down to the streetI'm shining like a new dimeThe downtown trains are fullFull of all those Brooklyn girlsThey try so hardTo break out of their little worldsWell, you wave your hand, and they scatter like crowsThey have nothing that will ever capture your heartThey're just thorns without the roseBe careful of them in the darkOh, if I was the oneYou chose to be your only oneOh, baby, can't you hear me now?Can't you hear me now?Will I see you tonightOn a downtown train?Every night is just the sameYou leave me lonely nowI know your window, and I know it's lateI know your stairs and your doorwayI walk down your street and past your gateI stand by the light at the four-wayYou watch them as they fallOh, baby, they all have heart attacksThey stay at the carnivalBut they'll never win you backWill I see you tonightOn a downtown train?Every night, every night is just the sameOh, babyWill I see you tonightOn a downtown train?All of my dreams, they fall like rainOh, baby, on a downtown trainWill I see you tonightOn a downtown train?Every night, every night is just the sameOh, babyWill I see you tonightOoh, on a downtown train?All of my dream just fall like rainOh, on a downtown trainOh, on a downtown trainOh, on a downtown trainOh, on a downtown trainOn a downtown trainDowntown trainOoh
