Outside another yellow moon Has punched a hole in the nighttime mist I climb to the window and down to the street I'm shining like a new dime The downtown trains are full Full of all those Brooklyn girls They try so hard To break out of their little worlds Well, you wave your hand, and they scatter like crows They have nothing that will ever capture your heart They're just thorns without the rose Be careful of them in the dark Oh, if I was the one You chose to be your only one Oh, baby, can't you hear me now? Can't you hear me now? Will I see you tonight On a downtown train? Every night is just the same You leave me lonely now I know your window, and I know it's late I know your stairs and your doorway I walk down your street and past your gate I stand by the light at the four-way You watch them as they fall Oh, baby, they all have heart attacks They stay at the carnival But they'll never win you back Will I see you tonight On a downtown train? Every night, every night is just the same Oh, baby Will I see you tonight On a downtown train? All of my dreams, they fall like rain Oh, baby, on a downtown train Will I see you tonight On a downtown train? Every night, every night is just the same Oh, baby Will I see you tonight Ooh, on a downtown train? All of my dream just fall like rain Oh, on a downtown train Oh, on a downtown train Oh, on a downtown train Oh, on a downtown train On a downtown train Downtown train Ooh
