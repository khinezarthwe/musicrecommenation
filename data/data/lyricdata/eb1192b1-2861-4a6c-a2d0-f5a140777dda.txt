Standing at the punch table swallowing punchCan't pay attention to the sound of anyoneA little more stupid, a little more scaredEvery minute more unpreparedI made a mistake in my life todayEverything I love gets lost in drawersI want to start over, I want to be winningWay out of sync from the beginningI wanna hurry home to youPut on a slow, dumb show for youAnd crack you upSo you can put a blue ribbon on my brainGod, I'm very, very frighteningI'll overdo itLooking for somewhere to stand and stayI leaned on the wall and the wall leaned awayCan I get a minute of not being nervousAnd not thinking with my dickMy leg is sparkles, my leg is pinsI better get my shit together, better gather my shit inYou could drive a car through my head in five minutesFrom one side of it to the otherI wanna hurry home to youPut on a slow, dumb show for youAnd crack you upSo you can put a blue ribbon on my brainGod I'm very, very frighteningI'll overdo itYou know, I dreamed about youFor 29 years before I saw youYou know, I dreamed about youI missed you for, for 29 yearsYou know, I dreamed about youFor 29 years before I saw youYou know, I dreamed about youI missed you for, for 29 years
