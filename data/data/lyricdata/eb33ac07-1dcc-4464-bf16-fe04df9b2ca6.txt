He went to sea for the dayHe wanted to know what to sayWhen he's asked what he'd doneIn the past to someoneThat he loves endlesslyNow she's gone, so is heI went to war every morningI lost my way but now I'm followingWhat you said in my armsWhat I read in the charmsThat I love durablyNow it's dead and gone and I am freeI went to sleep for the daytimeI shut my eyes to the sunshineTurned my head away from the noiseBruise and drip decay of childish toysThat I loved arguablyAll our labouring gone to seedWent out to play for the eveningWe wanted to hold onto the feelingOn the stretch in the sunAnd our breathlessness as we runTo the beach endlesslyAs the sun creeps up on the sea
