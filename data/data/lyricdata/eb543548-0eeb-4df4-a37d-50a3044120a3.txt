You hiss and groan and you constantly moanBut you don't ever go awayAnd that's becauseAll you need is meYou roll your eyes up to the skiesMock horrifiedBut you're still hereAll you need is meThere's so much destructionAll over the worldAnd all you can do isComplain about meYou bang your head against the wallAnd say you're sick of it allYet you remain'Cause all you need is meAnd then you offer your one and only jokeAnd you ask me what will I beWhen I grow up to be a manMe? Nothing!There's a soft voice singing in your headWho could this be?I do believe it's meThere's a naked man standing, laughing in your dreamsYou know who it isBut you don't like what it meansThere's so much destructionAll over the worldAnd all you can do isComplain about meI was a small, fat child in a welfare houseThere was only one thing I ever dreamed aboutAnd fate has justHanded it to me - whoopeeYou don't like me, but you love meEither way you're wrongYou're gonna miss me when I'm goneYou're gonna miss me when I'm gone
