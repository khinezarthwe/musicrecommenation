I just can't believe you're goneStill waiting for morning to comeWanna see if the sun will riseEven without you by my sideWhen we have so much in storeTell me what it is I'm reaching forWhen we're through building memoriesI'll hold yesterday in my heartIn my heartChorusThey can take tomorrow and the plans we madeThey can take the music that we'll never playAll the broken dreams take everythingJust take it awayBut they can never have yesterdayThey can take the future that we'll never knowThey can take the places that we said we would goAll the broken dreams take everythingJust take it awayBut they can never have yesterdayYou always used to sayI should be thankful for every dayHeaven knows what the future holdsOr at least how the story goes(But I never believed them till now)I know I'll see you again I'm sureNo it's not selfish to ask for moreOne more night, one more dayOne more smile on your faceBut they can't take yesterdayChorusI thought our days would last forever(But it wasn't our destiny)â€˜Cause in my mind we had so much timeBut I was so wrongNow I can believe thatI can still find the strengthIn the moments we madeI'm looking back on yesterdayChorusAll the broken dreams take everythingBut they can never have yesterday
