There's no time for usThere's no place for usWhat is this thing that builds our dreamsYet slips away from usWho wants to live forever?Who wants to live forever?OooooooThere's no chance for usIt's all decided for usThis world has only one sweet momentSet aside for usWho wants to live forever?Who wants to live forever?OooooooWho dares to love forever?  (Oh, whoa!)When love must dieBut touch my tears with your lipsTouch my world with your fingertipsAnd we can have foreverAnd we can love foreverForever is our todayWho wants to live forever?Who wants to live forever?Forever is our todayWho waits forever anyway?
