You walk out on the high wireYou're a dancer on thin iceYou pay no heed to the dangerAnd less to adviceYour footsteps are forbiddenBut with knowledge of your sinYou throw your love to all the strangersAnd caution to the windAnd you go dancing through doorwaysJust to see what you will findLeaving nothing to interfereWith the crazy balance of your mindAnd when you finally reappearAt the place where you came inYou've thrown your love to all the strangersAnd caution to the windIt takes love over goldAnd mind over matterTo do what you do that you mustWhen the things that you holdCan fall and be shatteredOr run through your fingers like dust
