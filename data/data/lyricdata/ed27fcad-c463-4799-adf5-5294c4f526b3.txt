Love has left the roomThe party is overBut I can't get soberObsession is towing meDeep down downLove has left the roomIt fled out the back doorWhen all I asked forWas forever moreOr a real bye byeIt didn't say bye byeAnd I'll let go if you just tell meGive back the pieces of dreamsThat you sell meThey trick my mindI'll let go if you just tell meI will forget youIf you will forget meI'll slip your mindI will slip your mindTie me to the mastCast me in ironsI hear the sirensThey sing of desireThe fatal kindThis love is my lastMy final possessionMost violent caressIt's a beautiful messAnd it's deep down downIt's really deep down downAnd I'll let go if you just tell meGive back the pieces of dreamsThat you sell meThey trick my mindI'll let go if you just let meI will forget youIf you will forget meI'll slip your mindI will slip your mindOnce it settles downAnd the fire has burned outWhat d'you think you'll findPoking through the embersMemories that stingLittle splinters of your doubtThings that you can live withoutSo why die?Give back the pieces of dreamsThat you sell meAnd trick my mindI'll let go if you just let meI will forget youIf you will forget meI'll slip your mindI will slip your mind
