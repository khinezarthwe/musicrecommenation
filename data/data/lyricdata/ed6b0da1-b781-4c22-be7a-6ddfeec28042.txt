There was a time when all the shadows of these tall buildingsWould throw their cape around each corner of the grassy fieldsAnd one by one, each huge shade would cover the green with blackAllowing changes that we could not have foreseenEverybody let us gaze upon the world we createdAnd let's rest our eyes upon the great machine as we wave goodbyeFeel the evening breeze caress us while the cities are dyingAs we watch it fall into a modern state, a modern timeRemember when we'd hear the distant sound of human lifeA zillion noises whimper as they travel through the skyAnd one by one, each little sound has faded away with timeAllowing changes that we could not have foreseenEverybody let us say goodbye to all our notions'Cause it's not enough to say that we're humane when we're left behindIt's too late to think that we can worship human emotions'Cause we've already evolved into machines in our minds.Hah-AhHah-AhHah-AhHah-AhHah-AhHah-AhHah-Ah
