I follow the MoskvaAnd down to Gorky ParkListening to the wind of changeAn August summer nightSoldiers passing byListening to the wind of changeThe world is closing inAnd did you ever thinkThat we could be so close, like brothersThe future's in the airI can feel it everywhereBlowing with the wind of changeTake me to the magic of the momentOn a glory nightWhere the children of tomorrow dream awayIn the wind of changeWalking down the streetAnd distant memoriesAre buried in the past foreverI follow the MoskvaAnd down to Gorky ParkListening to the wind of changeTake me to the magic of the momentOn a glory nightWhere the children of tomorrow share their dreamsWith you and meTake me to the magic of the momentOn a glory nightWhere the children of tomorrow dream awayIn the wind of changeThe wind of change blows straightInto the face of timeLike a storm wind that will ringThe freedom bell for peace of mindLet your balalaika singWhat my guitar wants to sayTake me to the magic of the momentOn a glory nightWhere the children of tomorrow share their dreamsWith you and meTake me to the magic of the momentOn a glory nightWhere the children of tomorrow dream awayIn the wind of change
