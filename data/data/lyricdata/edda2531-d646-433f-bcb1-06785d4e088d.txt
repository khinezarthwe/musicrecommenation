We can not wait much longerWe want happiness backWe want control of our bodiesEverything we've lackedI think I even liked itIf the feeling was mineA little something about my bodyIs it the warmth insideWhen we come home, we want it quiet and calmWe want you to sing us a songWhen we come home, we pull the curtains downMaking sure that the TV is onIf you move a little closerI'll tell you what's my aimIt's every evening on a big screenHosted by celebritiesI had a dream about deleting and killer whalesIs it the feeling of your bodyOr is it the feeling of mineWhen we come home, we want it quiet and calmWe want you to be aroundWhen we come home, we pull the curtains downMaking sure that the TV is onFrom off to onFrom off to on
