I am thinking it's a signThat the freckles in our eyes are mirror imagesAnd when we kiss they're perfectly alignedAnd I have to speculateThat God himself did make us into corresponding shapesLike puzzle pieces from the clayAnd true, it may seem like a stretchBut it's thoughts like this that catch my troubled head when you're awayWhen I am missing you to deathWhen you are out there on the roadFor several weeks of shows and when you scan the radioI hope this song will guide you homeThey will see us waving from such great heights"Come down now," they'll sayBut everything looks perfect from far away"Come down now," but we'll stayI tried my best to leaveThis all on your machine but the persistent beatIt sounded thin upon listeningAnd that frankly will not flyYou'll hear the shrillest highs and lowest lows with the windows downAnd this is guiding you homeThey will see us waving from such great heights"Come down now," they'll sayBut everything looks perfect from far away"Come down now," but we'll stay
