I was alone, I took a rideI didn't know what I would find thereAnother road where maybe ICould see another kind of mind thereOoh, then I suddenly see youOoh, did I tell you I need youEvery single day of my life?You didn't run, you didn't lieYou know I wanted just to hold youAnd had you gone, you knew in timeWe'd meet again, for I had told youOoh, you were meant to be near meOoh, and I want you to hear meSay we'll be together every dayGot to get you into my lifeSomehow, somewayWhat can I do? What can I be?When I'm with you I wanna stay thereIf I'm true, I'll never leaveAnd if I do I know the way thereOoh, then I suddenly see youOoh, did I tell you I need youEvery single day of my life?Got to get you into my lifeI've got to get you into my lifeI was alone, I took a rideI didn't know what I would find thereAnother road where maybe ICould see another kind of mind thereAnd then I suddenly see youDid I tell you I need youEvery single day?
