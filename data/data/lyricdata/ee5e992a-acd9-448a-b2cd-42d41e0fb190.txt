Somewhere beyond the sea Somewhere waitin' for me My lover stands on golden sands And watches the ships that go sailin' Somewhere beyond the sea She's there watchin' for me If I could fly like birds on high Then straight to her arms, I'd go sailin' It's far beyond a star It's near beyond the moon I know beyond a doubt My heart will lead me there soon We'll meet beyond the shore We'll kiss just as before Happy we'll be beyond the sea And never again I'll go sailin' I know beyond a doubt, ah! My heart will lead me there soon We'll meet, I know we'll meet beyond the shore We'll kiss just as before Happy we'll be beyond the sea And never again I'll go sailin' No more sailin' So long, sailin' Bye bye, sailin' Move on out, captain
