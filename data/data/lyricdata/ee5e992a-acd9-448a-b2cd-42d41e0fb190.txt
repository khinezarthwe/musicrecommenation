Somewhere beyond the seaSomewhere waitin' for meMy lover stands on golden sandsAnd watches the ships that go sailin'Somewhere beyond the seaShe's there watchin' for meIf I could fly like birds on highThen straight to her arms, I'd go sailin'It's far beyond a starIt's near beyond the moonI know beyond a doubtMy heart will lead me there soonWe'll meet beyond the shoreWe'll kiss just as beforeHappy we'll be beyond the seaAnd never again I'll go sailin'I know beyond a doubt, ah!My heart will lead me there soonWe'll meet, I know we'll meet beyond the shoreWe'll kiss just as beforeHappy we'll be beyond the seaAnd never again I'll go sailin'No more sailin'So long, sailin'Bye bye, sailin'Move on out, captain
