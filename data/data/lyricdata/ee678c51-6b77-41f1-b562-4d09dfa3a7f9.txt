Walk with me for a while to my house on the hill Forget where your body lies and i'll forget mine as well You have as much hope as you have hopelessness But can you identify just what keeps you down like this Do you feel the pain Or do you feel the memory Whether you're sound asleep, whether i'm wide awake Brother, you live and breathe, whether i've gone away Do you pass through the world lost in the rendering Of life as it felt before estranged to the passing day Do you feel the rain Or do you feel the memory There's no need to get depressed There's no need for anxiousness'cause the words won't come easy There's more to your work than this Do you feel the pain Or do you feel the memory
