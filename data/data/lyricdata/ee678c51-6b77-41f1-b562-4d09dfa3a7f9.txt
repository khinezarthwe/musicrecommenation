Walk with me for a while to my house on the hillForget where your body lies and i'll forget mine as wellYou have as much hope as you have hopelessnessBut can you identify just what keeps you down like thisDo you feel the painOr do you feel the memoryWhether you're sound asleep, whether i'm wide awakeBrother, you live and breathe, whether i've gone awayDo you pass through the world lost in the renderingOf life as it felt before estranged to the passing dayDo you feel the rainOr do you feel the memoryThere's no need to get depressedThere's no need for anxiousness'cause the words won't come easyThere's more to your work than thisDo you feel the painOr do you feel the memory
