I hate the way I cry when you say you miss me But I love the way you hold me when I sleep I hate the way I bleed each time you kiss me But you say hey, sleeping beauty, go back to sleep We had pennies in our pockets We had hope in our eyes You said, girl, you got a million different faces So why d'you put on that disguise Well take what you want cause I've got nothing Pass me some pills, I'll go to bed But however much I toss and turn I feel a dark place up ahead Some nights I just sit right here, I remember, I just remember Before it all got lost up in the mess He said, " Not all men are bad, and I am not like your dad And I will hold you, even though you're slightly mad Cause I am not a man who will ever break you" We had pennies in our pockets We had hope in our eyes You said, girl you've got a million different faces So why d'you put on that disguise Well you can take what you want cause I have got nothing Pass me some pills and I'll go to bed But however much I toss and turn I feel a dark place up ahead My doctor said I gotta sing a happy tune But my body gave up too soon You know what I am just fine 'til I'm on my own Somebody please come home I hate the way I tremble when you touch me You're like a needle slowly piercing my skin I hate the way my stomach aches And I really hate these loveless mistakes Cause I'm screaming for my rock who never picks up Why do you never pick up We had pennies in our pockets We had hope in our eyes You said, girl you've got a million different faces So why d'you put on that disguise Well you can take what you want cause I've got nothing Pass me some pills, and I will go to bed But, however much I toss and turn I feel a dark place up ahead My doctor said I've got to sing a happy tune Maybe if I skip my dinner, make myself pretty and thinner Maybe then he'll love me and stop looking at the other girls So you said I'm paranoid? I'm paranoid? I nearly choked And no more of that crap You cannot break someone who's just been broken You can't break somebody who's just been broken So take me now I'm naked As you watch I'll let you take it Maybe then you'll love me and stop looking at the other girls You said I'm paranoid? Well paranoid I nearly choked No more of that crap You cannot break someone who's just been broken You can't break somebody who's just been broken I don't need you, I don't want your words Maybe if I skip my dinner Make myself pretty and thinner Then I think he'll love me and stop looking at those other girls
