In some respects I suspect you've got a respectable side.When pushed and pulled and pressured, you seldom run and hide,But it's for someone else's benefit, not for what you wanna doUntil I realize that you've realized I'm gonna say these words to you.Yeah, you don't know what love is,You do as you're told.Just as a child of ten might act,But you're far too old.You're not hopeless, or helpless,And I hate to sound cold,But you don't know what love is,You just do as you're told.I can see your man can't help but win any problems that may arise,But in his mind, there can be no sin if you never criticize.You just keep on, repeating all those empty "I love you"s.Until you see you deserve better, I'm gonna lay right into you.Yeah, you don't know what love is,You just do as you're told.Just as a child of ten might act,But you're far too old.You're not hopeless, or helpless,And I hate to sound cold,But you don't know what love is,No you don't know what love is,No you don't know what love is,You just do as you're told.Yeah, do as you're toldYeah
