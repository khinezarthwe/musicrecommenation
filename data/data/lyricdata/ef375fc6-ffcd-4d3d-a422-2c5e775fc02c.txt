Once I wanted to be the greatestNo wind or waterfall could stall meAnd then came the rush of the floodStars at night turned deep to dustMelt me downInto big black armourLeave no trace of graceJust in your honourLower me downTo culprit southMake 'em washA space in townFor the leadAnd the dregs of my bedI've been sleepingLower me downPin me inSecure the groundsFor the later paradeOnce I wanted to be the greatestTwo fists of solid rockWith brains that could explainAny feelingLower me downPin me inSecure the groundsFor the leadAnd the dregs of my bedI've been sleepingFor the later paradeOnce I wanted to be the greatestNo wind or waterfall could stall meAnd then came the rush of the floodThe stars at night turned deep to dust
