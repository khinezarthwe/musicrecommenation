Where's the love song to set us free?Too many people downEverything turning the wrong way roundAnd I don't know what love would beBut if we stop dreaming nowLord knows we'll never clear the cloudsAnd you've been so busy lately that you haven't found the timeTo open up your mindAnd watch the world spinning gently out of timeFeel the sunshine on your faceIt's in a computer nowGone to the future way out in spaceAnd you've been so busy lately that you haven't found the timeTo open up your mindAnd watch the world spinning gently out of timeAnd you've been so busy lately that you haven't found the timeTo open up your mindAnd watch the world spinning gently out of timeTell me I'm not dreamingBut are we out of time?We're out of timeOut of timeOut of timeOut of timeOut of time
