Big bang, where we going what we doin this nightI feel drunk already maybe drink got spikedBut more likely of the like that I'm just a lightweightWell I don't care man I've been drunk foreverI've sedated hatred I've sedated pagesI've sedated worthwhile cages stages and all of my rageThis is a good time to start dancing to this song manA good one dj play the record on manSo where be Joey get us a drink a dimp of whiskeyAnd look at the lady she be shady but we maybeWhat you doing where you going to there afterShe said get the fuck out man you seem to be so plasteredAnd we be all the night drinking it staring at the girls alikeIt's all good man what goes on drink your canWalking it drunk down the StrandAnd talk about how you missed the whole club queueWell who the fuck are youChorus x2Heavy it's on my mindSay you feel just fineRacking stacking linesI said calm down dearestI remember shooting shit down the old alleywaysTalking tragedies of music like old HolidayI remember what we doing and I don't remember nowIt's the past it's the futureI don't know how to carry on though the rights and wrongsKick it like we know the songsAlready before we rock steady down and on the dancefloorWell I don't get no fights when I get angry drunkI sit down in the corner and I sulk my fucking socks offSo who the fuck are we? Just the boys in the cityIt's all been done before and we do it again soWe'll see you later alligatorsWe'll be back I'm sure next week sitting in the bar you knowSo good bye byeWe'll never try never to die butWe're so young we don't understand if we canna flySo we're here now but we will be gone soonBut not today not tomorrow not the next tuneChorus x2
