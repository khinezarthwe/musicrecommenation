Every day I'm more confused In my life you're all I know Laid your love before me I thought you knock me down You had me screaming for more There's a hole in the sky Don't tell me you're sorry Who cares? There's a tear in my eye Don't you tell me you're sorry Who cares? Used to be cool but I ain't no more When you told me it was gone Always playing love songs alone Without you near I'll never make it on my own There's a hole in the sky Don't tell me you're sorry Who cares? There's a tear in my eye Don't you tell me you're sorry Who cares? Now every time I want to hold you You keep your love away from me Now I can feel it and I need it close to me If you really want me, baby, if you really care You've got to stay right by my side You've got to stay right by my side' Cause I need you, baby
