Every day I'm more confusedIn my life you're all I knowLaid your love before meI thought you knock me downYou had me screaming for moreThere's a hole in the skyDon't tell me you're sorryWho cares?There's a tear in my eyeDon't you tell me you're sorryWho cares?Used to be cool but I ain't no moreWhen you told me it was goneAlways playing love songs aloneWithout you near I'll never make it on my ownThere's a hole in the skyDon't tell me you're sorryWho cares?There's a tear in my eyeDon't you tell me you're sorryWho cares?Now every time I want to hold youYou keep your love away from meNow I can feel it and I need it close to meIf you really want me, baby, if you really careYou've got to stay right by my sideYou've got to stay right by my side'Cause I need you, baby
