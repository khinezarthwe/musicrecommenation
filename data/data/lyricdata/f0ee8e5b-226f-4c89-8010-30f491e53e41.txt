I saw her, yeah I saw herWith her black tongue tied 'round the rosesFist pounding on a vending machineToy diamond ring stuck on her fingerWith a noose she can hang from the sunPut it out with her dark sunglassesWalking crooked down the beachShe spits on the sand where their bones are bleachingAnd I know I'm gonna steal her lifeShe doesn't even know what's wrongAnd I know I'm gonna make her dieTake her where her soul belongsAnd I know I'm gonna steal her lifeNothing that I wouldn't tryHey, my cyanide girlHey, my cyanide girlMy cyanide girlHey, my cyanide girlI saw her, yeah I saw her with her hands tied backAnd her rags were burningCrawling out from a land filled lifeScrawling her name upon the ceilingThrow a coin in a fountain of dustWhite noise, her ears are ringingGot a ticket for a midnight hangingThrow a bullet from a freight train leavingAnd I know I'm gonna steal her lifeShe doesn't even know what's wrongAnd I know I'm gonna make her dieTake her where her soul belongsAnd I know I'm gonna steal her lifeNothing that I wouldn't tryHey, my cyanide girlHey, my cyanide girlMy cyanide girlHey, my cyanide girl
