I woke up and he was screaming,I'd left him dreaming.I'll roll over and shake him tightlyAnd whisper, 'If they want you, they're gonna have to fight me.Oh fight me.'I woke up on a bench on Shepherd's Bush Green,A candle at my chest, and a head on his knee.I got up it was dark there is no one in the park at this hour.How do I keep finding myself here?'Oh fight me.'If look back and he is screaming,I'd left him dreamingA dangerous feat.And I'll run back and shake him tightlyAnd scream, 'If they want him they're gonna have to fight me.Oh fight me.'But if I wake up on a bench on Shepherd's Bush Green,A candle at my chest, and a head on his kneeI'll roll over and hold on tightlyAnd scream, 'If you want him, you're gonna have to fight me.Oh fight me. Oh fight me'
