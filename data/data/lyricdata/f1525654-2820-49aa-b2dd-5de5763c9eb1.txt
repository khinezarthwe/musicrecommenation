Tidal waves don't beg forgiveness, crashed and on their wayFather he enjoyed collisions, others walked awayA snowflake falls in mayAnd the doors are open now as the bells are ringing out'Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow, goodbye for nowNature has its own religion, gospel from the landFather ruled by long division, young men they pretendOld men comprehend.And the sky breaks at dawn, shedding light upon this town, they'll all come 'roundCause the man of the hour is taking his final bow, goodye for nowAnd the road the old man pavedThe broken seams along the wayThe rusted signs, left just for meHe was guiding me, Love, his own wayNow the man of the hour is taking his final bowAs the curtain comes down I feel that this is just goodbye for now
