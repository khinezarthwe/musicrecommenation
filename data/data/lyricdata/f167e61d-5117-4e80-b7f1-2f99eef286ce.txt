Giant steps are what you takeWalking on the moonI hope my legs don't breakWalking on the moonWe could walk foreverWalking on the moonWe could live togetherWalking onWalking on the moonWalking back from your houseWalking on the moonWalking back from your houseWalking on the moonFeet they hardly touch the groundWalking on the moonMy feet don't hardly make no soundWalking onWalking on the moonSome may sayI'm wishing my days awayNo wayAnd if it's the price I paySome sayTomorrow's another dayYou stayI may as well playGiant steps are what you takeWalking on the moonI hope my legs don't breakWalking on the moonWe could walk foreverWalking on the moonWe could be togetherWalking onWalking on the moonSome may sayI'm wishing my days awayNo wayAnd if it's the price I paySome sayTomorrow's another dayYou stayI may as well playKeep it up...
