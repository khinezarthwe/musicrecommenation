I don't want to live for tomorrow Save me I don't want to live for tomorrow Save me I don't want to live for tomorrow I don't want to live for the dying chance If you're already good as gone If you're already good as gone I don't want to live for another Take me I don't want to live for another Take me I don't want to live for another I don't want to live for the dying chance If you're already good as gone If you're already good as gone' Cause we live under the common tree But I'll learn to leave us there With all the fruit Still searching (still searching) Still looking in your eyes For a sign I need to know I don't want to wait any longer Race me I don't want to wait any longer Erase me I don't want to wait any longer I don't want to wish and hope and pray If you're already good as gone If you're already good as gone
