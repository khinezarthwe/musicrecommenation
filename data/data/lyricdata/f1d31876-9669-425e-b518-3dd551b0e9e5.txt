Goodbye, babyBaby, goodbyeDivine, ohFalling like a picture of timeOh, he was the Mother of AmericaHe was my self-determined guruMyself, I hold your big fat heart in my handsWell I hold your bleeding heart in my handsA supernovaA flame on fireShining in the darknessDid someone mention a rapture?Well I turn to think of youWho walked the way with so much pain?Who holds the mirror up to fools?And I'll murder the ingratesWho stand in our wayAnd I'll swallow shit, laughingOn my bed of hayAnd I hold your burning heart in my handsAnd I hold your burning heart in my handsA supernovaA flame on fireShining in the darknessDivineDivineA supernovaA flame on fireShining in the darkness
