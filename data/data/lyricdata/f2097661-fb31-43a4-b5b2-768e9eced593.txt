I'm dying to catch my breathOh why don't I ever learn?I've lost all my trust,Though I've surely tried to turn it aroundCan you still see the heart of me?All my agony fades awayWhen you hold me in your embraceDon't tear me down for all I needMake my heart a better placeGive me something I can believeDon't tear me downYou've opened the door now, don't let it closeI'm here on the edge againI wish I could let it goI know that I'm only one step awayFrom turning it aroundCan you still see the heart of me?All my agony fades awayWhen you hold me in your embraceDon't tear me down for all I needMake my heart a better placeGive me something I can believeDon't tear it down, what's left of meMake my heart a better placeI tried many times but nothing was realMake it fade away, don't break me downI want to believe that this is for realSave me from my fearDon't tear me downDon't tear me down for all I needMake my heart a better placeDon't tear me down for all I needMake my heart a better placeGive me something I can believeDon't tear it down, what's left of meMake my heart a better placeMake my heart a better place
