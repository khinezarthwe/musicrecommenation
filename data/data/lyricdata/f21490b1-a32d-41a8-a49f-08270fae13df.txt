Hey, hey, hey, hey She's hearing voices call her She's hearing voices warn her She just can't sleep in her bed She just can't sleep She's falling down the stairs She's tearing out her hair She's screaming my name in the night To keep her warm She got a red pill, blue pill Red pill, blue pill Red pill, blue pill Red pill, blue pill Red pill, blue pill Red pill, blue pill Red pill, blue pill Milk of amnesia Hey, hey, hey, hey Oh, come on and I know that you want it Was it nothing, nothing to write home about? Did the earth, did the earth not move? She got a red pill, blue pill Red pill blue pill Red pill blue pill Red pill blue pill Red pill blue pill Red pill blue pill Red pill blue pill Red pill blue pill She got a red pill, blue pill Red pill, blue pill Red pill, blue pill Red pill, blue pill Red pill, blue pill Red pill, blue pill Red pill, blue pill Milk of amnesia She's scared of the blacks and she's scared of the Jews She is walking around, she is yesterday's news And she cries out my name in the dead of the night She is sleeping in our room, she's crying on her side Walking on eggshells, walking on glass Burnt by the mirror, burnt by the light Feeling rejection, I'll burn down your house Tearing down posters, I was never, never alive
