I could corrupt youIn a heartbeatYou think you're so specialThink you're so sweetWhat are you tryingDon't even tempt meSoon you'll be cryingAnd wishing you dreamt meYou'd be calling out my nameWhen you need someone to blameI could corrupt youIt would be easyWatching you sufferGirl, it would please meBut I wouldn't touch youWith my little fingerI know it would crush youMy memory would lingerYou'd be crying out in painBegging me to play my gamesI could corrupt youIt would be uglyThey could sedate youBut what good would drugs beBut I wouldn't touch youPut my hands on your hipsIt would be too much toPlace my lips on your lipsYou'd be calling out my nameBegging me to play my games
