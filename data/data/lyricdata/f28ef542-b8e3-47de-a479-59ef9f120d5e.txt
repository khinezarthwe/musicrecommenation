I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in broad ways I will seek him whom my soul lovethWent over the sea,What did I find?A thousand crystal towersA hundred emerald citiesAnd the hand of the watchmanIn the night skyPoints to my belovedA knight in crystal armour…And I tried to hold himI tried for the creamI’ll make a suit of coloursTo stop the blinding mirrorsSew a cape of rainbowStifle up the beamWith the perfect armourWith the perfect dream…To be made of glass!When two suns are shiningThe battle becomes blindingTo be made of glass!But we’re light and light and lightand light and light!And from two suns spinningAt two different speedsWas born a hot white diamondBurning through the rainbowFlames fell into orbitTo hold eternallyTwo heavenly spiritsThat just wouldn’t seeTo be made of glass!When two suns are shiningThe battle becomes blindingTo be made of glass!But we’re light and light and lightand light and light!Hey, ohHey, oh oh ohHey, ohHey, oh oh ohHey, ohHey oh oh oh
