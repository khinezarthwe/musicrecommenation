Where are those happy days?They seem so hard to findI tried to reach for youBut you have closed your mindWhatever happened to our love?I wish I understoodIt used to be so niceIt used to be so goodSo when you're near me, darling, can't you hear meS.O.S.The love you gave me, nothing else can save meS.O.S.When you're goneHow can I even try to go on?When you're goneThough I try how can I carry on?You seem so far awayThough you are standing nearYou made me feel aliveBut something died I fearI really tried to make it outI wish I understoodWhat happened to our loveIt used to be so goodSo when you're near me, darling, can't you hear meS.O.S.The love you gave me, nothing else can save meS.O.S.When you're goneHow can I even try to go on?When you're goneThough I try how can I carry on?So when you're near me, darling, can't you hear meS.O.S.The love you gave me, nothing else can save meS.O.S.When you're goneHow can I even try to go on?When you're goneThough I try how can I carry on?When you're goneHow can I even try to go on?When you're goneThough I try how can I carry on?
