Did you see the stylish kids in the riot? Shovelled up like muck, set the night on fire Wombles bleed truncheons and shields You know I cherish you, my love But there's a rumour spread nasty disease around town Caught around the houses with your trousers down A head rush and in the bush You know I cherish you, my love Oh, how I cherish you, my love Tell me what can you want? Now you've got it all, ah, the scene is obscene Time will strip it away, a year and a day And Bill Bones, Bill Bones knows what I mean He knows it's eating, it's chewing me up It's not right for young lungs to be coughing up blood And it's all, it's all in my hands And it's all up the walls Now the stale chips are up and they hope stakes are down It's these ignorant faces that bring this town down And I sighed and sunken with pride You know I passed myself down on my knees Yes, I passed myself down on my knees Tell me what can you want? Now you've got it all, ah, the scene is obscene Time will strip it away, a year and a day And Bill Bones, Bill Bones knows what I mean There's fewer more distressing sights than that Of an Englishman in a baseball cap And we'll die in the class we were born That's a class of our own, my love A class of our own, my love Did you see the stylish kids in the riot? Shovelled up like muck, set the night on fire Wombles bleed, truncheons and shields You know I cherish you, my love Yeah, I cherish you, my love
