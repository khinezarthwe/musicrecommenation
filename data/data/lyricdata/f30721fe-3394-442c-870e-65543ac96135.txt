I'll be your mirrorReflect what you are, in case you don't knowI'll be the wind, the rain and the sunsetThe light on your door to show that you're homeWhen you think the night has seen your mindThat inside you're twisted and unkindLet me stand to show that you are blindPlease put down your hands'Cause I see youI find it hard to believe you don't knowThe beauty that you areBut if you don't let me be your eyesA hand in your darkness, so you won't be afraidWhen you think the night has seen your mindThat inside you're twisted and unkindLet me stand to show that you are blindPlease put down your hands'Cause I see youI'll be your mirror (Reflect what you are)I'll be your mirror (Reflect what you are)I'll be your mirror (Reflect what you are)I'll be your mirror (Reflect what you are)I'll be your mirror (Reflect what you are)
