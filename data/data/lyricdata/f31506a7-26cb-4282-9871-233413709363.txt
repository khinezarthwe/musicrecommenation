Bruised But Not BrokenBeen a lot that I've been throughI've cried a tear a time or two, babyyou know I cried some over youHad my heart kicked to the groundLove ripped me up and tore me down, babyBut that ain't enough to break meCuz I'll rise above itAnd I'll pick myself upAnd I'll dust the pain off my heartChorus:And I'll be alrightAnd I'll love againAnd the wounds will mendI'm bruised but not brokenAnd the pain will fadeI'll get back on my feetIt's not the end of meMy heart is still openI'm bruised but not brokenBeen a lot of tears stained nightsI thought the tears were here for life, babyThe hurt came on and held on tight, yeahI took a chance, I took a fallLove broke my heart and shattered all my dreamsBut I won't be down on my kneesCuz I'll rise above itAnd I'll pick myself upAnd I'll shake the rain out of my heartChorusAnd I'll be alrightAnd I'll love againAnd the wounds will mendI'm bruised but not brokenAnd the pain will fadeI'll get back on my feetIt's not the end of meMy heart is still openI'm bruised but not brokenGonna pick my heart upTake my life backShake the hurt awayPull myself together, put the pieces back in placeI learned love's so hardLove left my soul scarredI was shattered insideChorusAnd I'll be alrightAnd I'll love againAnd the wounds will mendI'm bruised but not brokenAnd the pain will fadeI'll get back on my feetIt's not the end of meMy heart is still openI'm bruised but not brokenChorus 2x(with adlibs)
