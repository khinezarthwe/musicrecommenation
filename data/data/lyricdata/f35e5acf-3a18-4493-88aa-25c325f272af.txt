A black cat moans when he's burning with the feverA stray dog howls when he's lonely in the nightA woman goes crazy with the thoughts of retributionThen a man starts weeping when he's sick and tired of lifeI keep on dreaming dreams of tomorrowFeel I'm wasting my time lighting candles in the windAlways taking my chances on the promise of the futureThat a heart full of sorrow paints a lonely tapestryThe sun is shiningOoh, but it's raining in my heartNo one understands the heartacheNo one feels the painNo one ever sees the tearsWhen you're crying in the rainWhen you're crying in the rainCrying in the rainI can never deny all the sweet things I've tastedThough I've been mistreated, I keep coming back for more, more, moreI know where I'm going, there's no hope of absolutionAnd can't seem to separate the good times from the badThe sun is shiningOoh baby, it's still raining in my heartIn my heartNo one understands the heartacheNo one feels the painNo one ever sees the tearsWhen you're crying in the rainWhen you're crying in the rainWhen you're crying in the rainWhen you're crying in the rain, no, no, noThe sun is shiningBut it's raining in my heartNo one understands the heartacheNo one feels the painNo one ever sees the tearsWhen you're crying in the rainWhen you're crying in the rainWhen you're crying in the rainWhen you're crying in the rainCrying in the rainCrying in the rain
