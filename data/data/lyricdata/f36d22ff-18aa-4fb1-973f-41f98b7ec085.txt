Spread the word aroundThe rat is leaving townThe message is a songThe misery is goneOnce I had a dreamTo sing before the queenShe didn't want to knowShe wouldn't see the showWhat a frightI couldn't do it rightOh what a nightMystic demons flyAll about the skyWith memories of a clownThe saddest show in townWhen I was seventeenMy mother said to meBe careful what you touchYou shouldn't take so muchI blew my mindShe was so kindI could have criedIn my mindI had to findA kind of new wayOf being oh so coolLike a blue-bloodedWell-studded English foolSpeak about the pastTimes are changing fastOnce I was so weakI couldn't even speakShaking put a curseNothing could be worseWalking through the doorWho could ask for moreNow I'm freeAnd I can seeThat I am meSpread the word aroundThe rat is leaving townThe message is a songThe misery is goneShaking out a curseNothing could be worseWalking through the doorWho could ask for moreNow I'm freeAnd I can seeThat I am mePlease stay away
