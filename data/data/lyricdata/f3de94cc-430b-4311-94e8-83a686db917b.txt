Time is never worth my timeBlue shine bleeds into my eyesI still sleep on the right sideBut the white noise can't leave the scene behindCould I be anything you want me to beIf so, is it meant to be seenWhen you see yourself in a crowded roomDo your fingers itch, are you pistol whippedWill you step in line or release the glitchCan you fall asleep with a panic switchWhen you see yourself in a crowded roomDo your fingers itch, are you pistol whippedWill you step in line or release the glitchDo you think she'll sleep with a panicAnd I'll try to hold on tight tonightPink slip inviting me insideWant to burn skin and brand what once was mineBut the red views keep ripping the divideIf I go everywhere you want me to goHow will I know you'll still followWhen you see yourself in a crowded roomDo your fingers itch, are you pistol whippedWill you step in line or release the glitchCan you fall asleep with a panic switchWhen you see yourself in a crowded roomDo your fingers itch, are you pistol whippedWill you step in line or release the glitchDo you think she'll sleep with a panicI'm waiting and fading and floating awayWaiting and fading and floating awayWaiting and fading and floating awayWaiting and fading and floatingI'm waiting and fading and floating awayWaiting and fading and floating awayWaiting and fading and floating awayWaiting and fading, waiting and fadingWhen you see yourself in a crowded roomDo your fingers itch, are you pistol whippedWill you step in line or release the glitchCan you fall asleep with a panic switchWhen you see yourself in a crowded roomDo your fingers itch, are you pistol whippedWill you step in line or release the glitchDo you think she'll sleep with a panic
