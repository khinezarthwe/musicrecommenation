I was minding my businessLifting some lead offThe roof of the Holy Name churchIt was worthwhile living a laughable lifeTo set my eyes on the blistering sightOf a vicar in a tutuHe's not strangeHe just wants to live his life this wayA scanty bit of a thingCovered with a decorative ringWouldn't cover the head of a gooseAs Rose collects the money in the cannisterWho comes sliding down the bannister?Vicar in a tutuHe's not strangeHe just wants to live his life this wayThe monkish monsignorWith a head full of plasterSaid: "My man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned!"As Rose counts the money in the cannisterAs natural as RainAnd he dances again, my GodVicar in a tutu..The next day in the pulpitWith Freedom and EaseCombatting ignorance, dust with diseaseAs Rose counts the money in the cannisterAs natural as RainAnd he dances again and again..With a fabric of a tutuAny man could get used toAnd I am the living signAnd I'm a living signI'm a living sign..
