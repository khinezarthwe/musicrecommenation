I feel your racing heartMy liquid silver arms extendedThese waves aren't far apartBlack gold in clawfoot tubs unchangingI am fire, where's my form?Whisper crimson I intrudeThere's light beneath your eyesNew overtones in viewEndless form, endless timeIf what they say is trueYou are a shadow in fourth dimensionTo float away with youWe see the corners where nothing happensWhile we drifted we were oneCeilings lifted, walls were goneYou speak the language of the breezeAll your leaves were meant for meThe love that every person wants to beStuck together, I don't like revealing secretsI'll live inside your lips if you won't laughMy heaving hands on rotten fruit at lastFallow fingers, there's a surface I can count onShe'd fit inside my heart and take it overTill her cape got blown into my red lungsEither there's a purposeOr I'm heading out at breakfastTake a drink, take a dragOne more coffee, ugly hatNo more mirrors, woolen bagAnd I am gone
