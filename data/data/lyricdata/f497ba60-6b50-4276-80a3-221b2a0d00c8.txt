What you get ain't what you see Things that don't come easily Feelin' happy in my pain Icicles within my brain Somethin' blowin' in my head Winds of ice that soon will spread Death would freeze my very soul Makes me happy, makes me cold My eyes are blind, but I can see The snowflakes glisten on the trees The sun no longer sets me free I feel the snowflakes freezing me Let the winter sun shine on Let me feel the frost of dawn Fill my dreams with flakes of snow Soon I'll feel the chilling glow Don't you think I know what I'm doing Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong You're the one that's really a loser This is where I feel I belong Crystal world with winter flowers Turns my days to frozen hours Lying snowblind in the sun Will my Ice Age ever come?
