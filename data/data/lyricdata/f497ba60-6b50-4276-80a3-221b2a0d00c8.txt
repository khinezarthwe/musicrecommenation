What you get ain't what you seeThings that don't come easilyFeelin' happy in my painIcicles within my brainSomethin' blowin' in my headWinds of ice that soon will spreadDeath would freeze my very soulMakes me happy, makes me coldMy eyes are blind, but I can seeThe snowflakes glisten on the treesThe sun no longer sets me freeI feel the snowflakes freezing meLet the winter sun shine onLet me feel the frost of dawnFill my dreams with flakes of snowSoon I'll feel the chilling glowDon't you think I know what I'm doingDon't tell me that it's doing me wrongYou're the one that's really a loserThis is where I feel I belongCrystal world with winter flowersTurns my days to frozen hoursLying snowblind in the sunWill my Ice Age ever come?
