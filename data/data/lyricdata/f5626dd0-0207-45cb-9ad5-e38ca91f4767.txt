I knew all along That I was right at the start About the seeds of the weeds That grew in your heart Self satisfaction for the factions Who formed to tear us apart Oh I gave you the midas touch As you turned round to scratch out my heart Oh what did you expect? Oh tell me what did you expect? To lay it on my head? So is it all upon my head? Bang bang you're dead! Oh I'm so easily lead Bang, bang, you're de-e-ead! Put all those rumours to bed Bang, bang you're dead I knew all along But I was loathe to believe There was nothing but spite Fury and lies Of the words that you weave An illusion to a conclusion And oh its oh so tawdry When you put it to bed kick it in the head Oh won't they just let it be Bang bang you're dead! Oh I'm so easily lead Bang, bang, you're de-e-ead! Put all those rumours to bed Bang, bang you're dead Bang bang bang bang you're dead
