I knew all alongThat I was right at the startAbout the seeds of the weedsThat grew in your heartSelf satisfaction for the factionsWho formed to tear us apartOh I gave you the midas touchAs you turned round to scratch out my heartOh what did you expect?Oh tell me what did you expect?To lay it on my head?So is it all upon my head?Bang bang you're dead!Oh I'm so easily leadBang, bang, you're de-e-ead!Put all those rumours to bedBang, bang you're deadI knew all alongBut I was loathe to believeThere was nothing but spiteFury and liesOf the words that you weaveAn illusion to a conclusionAnd oh its oh so tawdryWhen you put it to bed kick it in the headOh won't they just let it beBang bang you're dead!Oh I'm so easily leadBang, bang, you're de-e-ead!Put all those rumours to bedBang, bang you're deadBang bang bang bang you're dead
