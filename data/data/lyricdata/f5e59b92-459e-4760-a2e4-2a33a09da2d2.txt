I found him by the railroad track this morningI could see that he was nearly deadI knelt down beside him and I listenedJust to hear the words the dying fellow saidHe said they let me out of prison down in FriscoFor ten long years I've paid for what I've doneI was trying to get back to LouisianaTo see my Rose and get to know my sonGive my love to Rose please won't you mister?Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothesTell my boy that daddy's so proud of himAnd don't forget to give my love to RoseWon't you tell them I said thanks for waiting for me?Tell my boy to help his mom at homeTell my Rose to try to find anotherFor it ain't right that she should live aloneMister here's the bag with all my moneyIt won't last them long the way it goesGod bless you for finding me this morningNow don't forget to give my love to RoseGive my love to Rose, please, won't you, mister?Take her all my money, tell her to buy some pretty clothesTell my boy that daddy's so proud of himAnd don't forget to give my love to Rose
