Racy days help me through the hopeless hazeBut my, oh myTragic eyes, I can't even recognize myselfBehindSo, if the answer is noCan I change your mind?Out again, a siren screams at half past tenAnd you won't let goWhile I ignore that we both felt like this beforeIt starts to showSo, if I have a chanceWould you let me know?Why aren't you shaking?Step back in timeGraciously takingOh, you're too kindAnd if the answer is noCan I change your mind?We're all the sameAnd love is blindThe sun is goneBefore it shinesAnd I said if the answer is noCan I change your mind?If the answer is noCan I change your mind?
