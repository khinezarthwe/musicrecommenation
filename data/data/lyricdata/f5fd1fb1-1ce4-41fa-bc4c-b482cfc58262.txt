Racy days help me through the hopeless haze But my, oh my Tragic eyes, I can't even recognize myself Behind So, if the answer is no Can I change your mind? Out again, a siren screams at half past ten And you won't let go While I ignore that we both felt like this before It starts to show So, if I have a chance Would you let me know? Why aren't you shaking? Step back in time Graciously taking Oh, you're too kind And if the answer is no Can I change your mind? We're all the same And love is blind The sun is gone Before it shines And I said if the answer is no Can I change your mind? If the answer is no Can I change your mind?
