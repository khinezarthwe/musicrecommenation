Water, water on the seedsTo my left they rose and leafTo my right cross Seven SeasMaybe maybe they'll stay trueMy seeds will cross and then take rootAnd leave you to an empty roomLonely, lonely that is youLonely, lonely that is youPaper paper obsoleteHow will you reach out to meI thought you'd ask me not to leaveLonely, lonely that is meLonely, lonely that is meDistance makes the heart grow weakSo that the mouth can barely speakExcept to those who hide their needsAnd I have read the golden sealThat tells of how the seedlings feelReminds my heart what love can yieldBy my only things are clearBaby boy I'm staying hereLonely, lonely that was youLonely and so untrue
