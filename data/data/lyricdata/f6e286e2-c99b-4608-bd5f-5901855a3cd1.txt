Memory comes when memory's oldI am never the first to knowFollowing the stream up NorthWhere do people like us floatThere is room in my lapFor bruises, asses, handclapsI will never disappearFor forever, I'll be hereWhisperingMorning, keep the streets empty for meMorning, keep the streets empty for meI'm laying down, eating snowMy fur is hot, my tongue is coldOn a bed of spider webI think about to change myselfA lot of hope in a one man tentThere's no room for innocenceTake me home before the stormVelvet mites will keep us warmWhisperingMorning, keep the streets empty for meUncover our heads and reveal our soulsWe were hungry before we were born
