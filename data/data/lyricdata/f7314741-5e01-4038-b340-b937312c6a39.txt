When I was a young girl I used to seek pleasureWhen I was a young girl I used to drink aleOut of the ale house down into the jail houseMy body's salvation and Hell is my doomCome mama come papa and sit you down by meCome sit you down by me and pity my caseMy poor head is aching my sad heart in breakingMy body's salvation and hell is my doomPlease send for the preacher to come and pray for meAnd send for the doctor to heal all my woundsMy poor head is aching my sad heart in breakingMy body's salvation and I'm bound to dieOne morning one morning one morning in MayI saw this young lady all wrapped in white linenAll wrapped in white linen and called out "the plague"
