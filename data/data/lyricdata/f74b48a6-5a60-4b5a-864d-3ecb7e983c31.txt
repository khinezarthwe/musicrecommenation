In the deepest ocean, the bottom of the seaYour eyes, they turn meWhy should I stay here?Why should I stay?I'd be crazy not to followFollow where you leadYour eyes, they turn meTurn me into phantomsI follow to the edge of the earth and fall offYeah, everybody leaves if they get the chanceAnd this is my chanceI get eaten by the worms and weird fishesPicked over by the worms and weird fishesWeird fishes, weird fishesYeah, I hit the bottom, hit the bottom and escape, escapeI hit the bottom, hit the bottom and escape, escape
