Feel the vibe, feel the terror, feel the pain, it's driving me insaneI can't fake, for God's sakes, why am I driving in the wrong laneTrouble is my middle name, but in the end I'm not too badCan someone tell me if it's wrong to be so mad about youMad about youMadAre you the fishy wine who will give me a headache in the morningOr just a dark blue landmine that will explode without a decent warningGive me all your true hate and I'll translate it in our bedInto never seen passion, never seen passion, that's why I am so mad about youMad about youMadTrouble is your middle nameBut in the end you're not too badCan someone tell me if it's wrong to be so mad about youMad about youMad about youMad about youMadGive me all your true hateAnd I'll translate it in your bedInto never seen passionThat is why I am so mad about youMad about youMad about youMad about youMad about youMad about youMad about you
