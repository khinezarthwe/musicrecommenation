Disenchanted lullabiesSing me yours, I'll sing you mineSing with me now what's a boy to do?What's a boy to do?Sing along for yesterdaySing along my soul to takeSing along another song for youWhat's a boy to do?CORUS:I may be scatteredA little shallowWhat does it matter?No one has a fit like I doI may be scatteredA little shallowWhat does it matter?No one has a fit like I doI'm the only one that fits youWhisper with me pass the timeWhisper for the days gone byWhisper with the voice inside of youWith this ring you will be mineWith this ring I'll multiplyWith this ring surrendering to youWhat's a boy to do?I may be scatteredA little shallowWhat does it matter?No one has a fit like I doI may be scatteredA little shallowWhat does it matter?No one has a fit like I doI'm the only one that fits youuuuu........I may be scatteredA little shallowWhat does it matter?No one has a fit like I doI may be scatteredA little shallowWhat does it matter?No one has a fit like I doI'm the only one that fits youNo one has a fit like I doI'm the only one that fits you
