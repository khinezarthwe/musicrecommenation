You go with your two feet bareDown through the cold lane there to BrightonA country house, a liar and a louse live thereAnd go with your arms held wideHappiness in your eyes, come and sitAnd stay the night, turn out every light you seeAnd lay them down, buried in the ground for meOh, my loveOh, my loveOh, my loveOh, my loveThe tongues of the creatures waitDrawn to the fragile legs you walk onA cold wind blows, Brighton to the coast for meA cold wind blows, Brighton to the coast for meOh, my loveOh, my loveOh, my loveOh, my loveOh, my loveOh, my loveOh, my loveOh, my love
