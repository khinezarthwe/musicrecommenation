You go with your two feet bare Down through the cold lane there to Brighton A country house, a liar and a louse live there And go with your arms held wide Happiness in your eyes, come and sit And stay the night, turn out every light you see And lay them down, buried in the ground for me Oh, my love Oh, my love Oh, my love Oh, my love The tongues of the creatures wait Drawn to the fragile legs you walk on A cold wind blows, Brighton to the coast for me A cold wind blows, Brighton to the coast for me Oh, my love Oh, my love Oh, my love Oh, my love Oh, my love Oh, my love Oh, my love Oh, my love
