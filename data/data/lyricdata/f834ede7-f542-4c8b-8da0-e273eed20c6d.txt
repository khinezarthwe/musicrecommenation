Though I have a broken heartI'm too busy to be heartbrokenThere's a lot of things that need to be doneLord I have a broken heartThough I have a broken dreamI'm too busy to be dreaming of youThere's a lot of things that I gotta doLord I have a broken dreamAnd I'm wasted all the timeI've gotta drink you right off of my mindI've been told that this will heal given timeLord I have a broken heartAnd I'm crying all the timeI have to keep it covered up with a smileAnd I'll keep on moving on for a whileLord I have a broken heart
