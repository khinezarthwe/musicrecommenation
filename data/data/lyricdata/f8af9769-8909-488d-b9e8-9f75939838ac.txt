Has our conscience shown?Has the sweet breeze blown?Has all kindness gone?Hope still lingers onI drink myself a new found pitySittin' alone in New York CityAnd I don't know whyAre we listening?Lips of offeringHave we eyes to see?Love is gatheringAll the words that I've been readingHave not started the act of bleedingInto oneInto oneSo I walk up on highAnd I step to the edgeTo see my world belowAnd I laugh at myselfAs the tears roll down'Cause it's the world I knowOh, it's the world I knowI drink myself a new found pitySittin' alone in New York CityAnd I don't know whyI don't know whySo I walk up on highAnd I step to the edgeTo see my world belowAnd I laugh at myselfAs the tears roll down'Cause it's the world I knowOh, it's the world I knowYeah, I walk up on highAnd I step to the edgeTo see my world belowAnd I laugh at myselfWhile the tears roll down'Cause it's the world I knowOh, it's the world I know
