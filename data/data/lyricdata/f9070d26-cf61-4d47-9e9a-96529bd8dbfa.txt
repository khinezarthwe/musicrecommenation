You can spin your world behind my falling starThe slab beneath you in your long killing smileI've got the time to spare but you don't need itI've got my mind in anywayYou can always shine behind my hidden doorJust like a flame although with you I couldn't tellI'm not the one who ever walks lightDon't have a feeling that I wanna waste my timeBut you know I got to and you know I want to with youAll the time, all the time, all the timeIâ€™m feeling like I want to hang aroundDon't have a leading anymore to let it downBut you know I want to with you and you know I could with youAll the while I spend my time making schemesNow I know when things are always what they seemBut you know they should, yeahAnd you know I want that to changeAnd you know I want that to changeAnd you know I want that, please
