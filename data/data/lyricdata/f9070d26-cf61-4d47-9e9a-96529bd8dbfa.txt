You can spin your world behind my falling star The slab beneath you in your long killing smile I've got the time to spare but you don't need it I've got my mind in anyway You can always shine behind my hidden door Just like a flame although with you I couldn't tell I'm not the one who ever walks light Don't have a feeling that I wanna waste my time But you know I got to and you know I want to with you All the time, all the time, all the time Iâ€™m feeling like I want to hang around Don't have a leading anymore to let it down But you know I want to with you and you know I could with you All the while I spend my time making schemes Now I know when things are always what they seem But you know they should, yeah And you know I want that to change And you know I want that to change And you know I want that, please
