Close to my skin, I'm falling in, someone who's beenSittin' by the phone, I'm left alone in another zoneJohn says to live above hell and my will is wellNo one is waiting for me to fail and my will could sail, yeahIt's such a waste to be wasted in the first placeI want to taste the taste of being face to face with common graceTo meditate on the warmest dreamAnd when I walk alone, I listen to our secret themeYour solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seenSomebody close that can see right throughI'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anythingI will for youSailin' for the sun 'cause th-there is one that knows where I'm fromI care for you, I really do, I really doCome closer now, so you can lie right by my sideSit alone in the sun, I wrote a letter to you, I'm getting over myself, yeahYour solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seenSomebody close that can see right throughI'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anythingI will for youYour solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seenSomebody close that was made for youI'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anythingI will for youClose to my skin, someone who's been, I'm-a falling inDisasters are just another star falling in my yardJohn says to live above hell and my will is wellLong to be with someone to tell, I love your smell
