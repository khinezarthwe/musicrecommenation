Can you hear the drums, Fernando?I remember long ago another starry night like thisIn the firelight, FernandoYou were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitarI could hear the distant drumsAnd sounds of bugle calls were coming from afarThey were closer now, FernandoEvery hour every minute seemed to last eternallyI was so afraid, FernandoWe were young and full of life and none of us prepared to dieAnd I'm not ashamed to sayThe roar of guns and cannons almost made me cryThere was something in the air that nightThe stars were bright, FernandoThey were shining there for you and meFor liberty, FernandoThough I never thought that we could loseThere's no regretIf I had to do the same againI would, my friend, FernandoIf I had to do the same againI would, my friend, FernandoNow we're old and grey, FernandoSince many years I haven't seen a rifle in your handCan you hear the drums, Fernando?Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?I can see it in your eyesHow proud you were to fight for freedom in this landThere was something in the air that nightThe stars were bright, FernandoThey were shining there for you and meFor liberty, FernandoThough I never thought that we could loseThere's no regretIf I had to do the same againI would, my friend, FernandoThere was something in the air that nightThe stars were bright, FernandoThey were shining there for you and meFor liberty, FernandoThough I never thought that we could looseThere's no regretIf I had to do the same againI would, my friend, FernandoYes, if I had to do the same againI would, my friend, Fernando
