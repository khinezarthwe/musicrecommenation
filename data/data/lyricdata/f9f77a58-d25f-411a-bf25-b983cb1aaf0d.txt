Your face, it shows you are an imposterThat snapshot still in the parking lotYou're on the screen, I feel you downtownOut on the street, I feel the undergroundThe distance makes me want you moreThe scent you give, that's what I'm waiting forYour birthday song until your family learnsWhat are the things I planned, and that I'll be your manTonight I got your numberI even know your streetIf you could only need meI know we're meant to meetAnd even if they find youI know you make me feelYou make me feel more than realThey put you on, in the smoking glassYour dress got torn straight through the underpassThe air got blue while in my closed-in roomI'm checking off what's left to doThe distance makes me want you moreThe scent you give, that's what I'm waiting forYour birthday song until your family learnsWhat are the things I planned, and that I'll be your manTonight I got your numberI even know your streetIf you could only need meI know we're meant to meetAnd even if they find youI know you make me feelYou make me feel more than realTonight I got your numberI even know your streetIf you could only need meI know we're meant to meetAnd even if they find youI know you make me feelYou make me feel more than real
