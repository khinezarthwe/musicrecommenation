In the lush Virginia hillsThey kept her as long as they could'Cause they knew when the white brother foundWhite shell beads wrapped around herSkin a life giving riverHer body open as will his handAnd with a, there she goesShe may betray all that she lovesAnd even wait for their saviour to comeAnd in some things, maybe he'll be rightBut as always, the thing that he loves he will changeFrom her sunrise to clockwise to soul tradingStill she'll lay down her body covering him all the sameSo hundreds of years go byShe's a girl out working her tradeAnd she loses a little each dayTo ghetto pimps and presidentsWho try and arouse her turquoise serpentsShe can't recall what they representAnd when you ask she won't knowShe will betray all that she lovesAnd even wait for their saviour to comeAnd in some things maybe he'll be rightBut as always the thing that he loves he will changeFrom her sunrise to clockwise to soul tradingStill she'll lay down her body covering him all the sameOh VirginiaDo you remember?You won't even youOh VirginiaWhen the land held your handYou won't even youWhen the Land held your handOh VirginiaYou won't even youShe will let you back inOh VirginiaDo you rememberoh VirginiaYou can't remember your name
