There is a black riverIt passes by my windowAnd late at nightAll dolled up like ChristI walk the waterBetween the piersSingingOh, river of sorrowRiver of time, riverRiver of sorrowDon't swallow this timeFor we all know the baby has expiredLong ago she was pulled from the mireAnd no precious liar or well-wisherCan return the love that was stolenSo oh, river of sorrowRiver of time, riverRiver of sorrowDon't swallow this timeCan you see the lightAt the end of the dark passageway?Take me with you towards the lightInto the darkness passing over the faces in the riverHear me, I'm whispering in your earOh, river of sorrowOh, river of timeRiver of sorrowDon't swallow this timeOh, river of sorrowOh, river of timeRiver of sorrowDon't swallow this time
