Ohh!Ohh!I'm waiting for my moment to comeI'm waiting for the movie to beginI'm waiting for a revelationI'm waiting for someone to count me in'Cause now I only see my dreams, in everything I touchFeel their cold hands on, everything that I loveCold like some, magnificent skylineOut of my reach, but always in my eyeline nowWe're tumbling downWe're spirallingTied up to the groundWe're spirallingI fashioned you from jewels and stoneI made you in the image of myselfI gave you everything you wantedSo you would never know anything elseBut every time I reach for you, you slip through my fingersInto cold sunlight, laughing at the things thatI had planned, the map of my world getsSmaller as I sit here, pulling at the loose threads nowWe're tumbling downWe're spirallingTied up to the groundWe're spirallingWhen we fall in loveWe're just fallingIn love with ourselvesWe're spirallingDid you wanna be a winner?Did you wanna be an icon?Did you wanna be famous?Did you wanna be the president?Did you wanna start a war?Did you wanna have a family?Did you wanna be in love?Did you wanna be in love?I never saw the lightI never saw the lightI waited up all nightBut I never saw the lightWhen we fall in loveWe're just fallingIn love with ourselvesWe're spirallingWe're tumbling downWe're spirallingTied up to the groundWe're spirallingOhh!Ohh!
