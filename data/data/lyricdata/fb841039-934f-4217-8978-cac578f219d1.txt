Don't leave me in all this painDon't leave me out in the rainCome back and bring back my smileCome and take these tears awayI need your arms to hold me nowThe nights are so unkindBring back those nights when I held you beside meUn-break my heartSay you'll love me againUndo this hurt you caused when you walked out the doorAnd walked outta my lifeUn-cry these tearsI cried so many nightsUn-break my heart, my heartTake back that sad word,Bring back the joy to my lifeDon't leave me here with these tearsCome and kiss this pain awayI can't forget the day you leftTime is so unkindAnd life is so cruel without you here beside meUn-break my heartSay you'll love me againUndo this hurt you caused when you walked out the doorAnd walked outta my lifeUn-cry these tearsI cried so many nightsUn-break my heart, my heartDon't leave me in all this painDon't leave me out in the rainBring back the nights when I held you beside meUn-break my heartSay you'll love me againUndo this hurt you caused when you walked out the doorAnd walked outta my lifeUn-cry these tearsI cried so many, many nightsUn-break my, un-break my heart, oh babyCome back and say you love meUn-break my heart, sweet darlin'Without you I just can't go onCan't go on
