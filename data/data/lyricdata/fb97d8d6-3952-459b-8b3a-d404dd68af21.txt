In the days, the golden daysWhen everybody knew what they wantedIt ain't here todayThrough the times of lasting loveWhen parents talked of things tried and testedIt don't feel the sameDreams and belief have goneTime, life itself goes onFar beyond the shrinking skiesWhere money talks and leaves us hypnotisedIt don't pave the wayUnderneath the fading sunThe silent sum of a businessmanHas left us chokingDreams and belief have goneTime, life itself goes onIn the days, the golden daysWhen everybody knew what they wantedIt ain't here todayDreams and belief have goneTime, life itself goes on
