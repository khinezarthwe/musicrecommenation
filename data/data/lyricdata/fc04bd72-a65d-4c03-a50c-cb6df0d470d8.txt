Yellow walls are lined with portraitsAnd I've got my new red fetching leather jacketAll these poses such beautiful posesMakes any boy feel like picking up rosesThere's never been such grave a matterAs comparing our new brand name black sunglassesAll these poses such beautiful posesMakes any boy feel as pretty as princesThe green autumnal parks conductin'And the city streets a wondrous chorus singingAll these poses oh how can you blame meLife is a game and true love is a trophyAnd you saidWatch my head about itBaby you said watch my head about itMy head about itOh no oh no oh noOh no oh noNo kiddingReclined amongst these packs of reasonsFor to smoke the days away into the eveningsAll these poses of classical tortureRuined my mind like a snake in the orchardI did go from wanting to be someoneNow I'm drunk and wearing flip-flops on Fifth AvenueOnce you've fallen from classical virtueWon't have a soul for to wake up and hold youIn the green autumnal park conductin'All the city streets a wondrous chorus singingAll these poses now no longer boyishMade me a man ah but who cares what that isAnd you said watch my head about itBaby you said watch my head about itMy head about itOh no oh no oh noOh no oh noAnd you said watch my head about itBaby you said watch my head about itMy head about itOh no oh no oh noOh no oh noNo kidding
