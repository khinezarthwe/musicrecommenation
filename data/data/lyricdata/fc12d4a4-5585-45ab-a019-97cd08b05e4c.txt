From way far across the sea Came an Eritrean maiden, she Had a one track mind and eyes for me Half blinded in the war With a pale young Anglican Who said he'd help her all he can Showed her Jesus and his little unholy friend She had no mind to please him Just say "ta-ra" and leave him behind A little boy in a stairwell Who says " I hate people like you I got match sticks and cable T V Half of less than 50p" We all clambered over the balcony Banging on the window waking Steve Bringing with a true love his unholy friend Singing if you really need it You just won't leave it behind So baby, please kill me Oh baby, don't kill me But don't bring that ghost 'round to my door I don't wanna see them anymore Please kill me Oh baby, don't kill me Just don't bang on about yesterday You know I wouldn't know about that anyway Monkey said to the mouse before If she loved anybody more than he It turns you into stone Now I'm reversing down a lonely street Cheap hotel where I can meet the past Pay it off and keep it sweet It's sweet like nothing, oh It's just like nothing at all Yes, I've seen you there How could I help but stare It rips the heart out of your baby You've taken far too much to see or think or touch What's real, stranded on this street That paved my only way home If you really need it, oh You just won't leave it behind Oh please, kill me Oh no, don't kill me Don't bring that ghost 'round to my door I don't wanna see them anymore Please kill me Oh no, don't kill me Don't go on about yesterday You know I wouldn't know about that any way, oh no He got nothing, oh He got nothing at all
