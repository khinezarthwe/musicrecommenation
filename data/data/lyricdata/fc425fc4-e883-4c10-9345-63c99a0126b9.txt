A change of speed, a change of styleA change of scene, with no regretsA chance to watch, admire the distanceStill occupied, though you forgetDifferent colours, different shadesOver each mistakes were madeI took the blameDirectionless so plain to seeA loaded gun won't set you freeSo you sayWe'll share a drink and step outsideAn angry voice and one who criedWe'll give you everything and moreThe strain's too much, can't take much moreOh, I've walked on water, run through fireCan't seem to feel it anymoreIt was me, waiting for meHoping for something moreMe, seeing me this timeHoping for something else
