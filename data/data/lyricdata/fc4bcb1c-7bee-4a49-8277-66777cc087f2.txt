Watch the sunAs it crawls across a final timeAnd it feels likeLike it was a friendIf it's watching usAnd the world we set on fireDo you wonderIf it feels the same?And the sky is filled with lightCan you see it?All the black is really whiteIf you believe itAs the time is running outLet me take away your doubtWe can find a better placeIn this twilightDust to dustAshes in your hair remind meWhat it feels likeAnd I won't feel againNight descendsCould I have been a better person?If I could onlyDo it all againBut the sky is filled with lightCan you see it?All the black is really whiteIf you believe itAnd the longing that you feelYou know none of this is realWe will find a better placeIn this twilight
