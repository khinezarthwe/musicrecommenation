On the floor of TokyoOr down in London town to go, goWith the record selectionWith the mirror reflectionI'm dancing with myselfWhen there's no-one else in sightIn the crowded lonely nightWell I wait so longFor my love vibrationAnd I'm dancing with myselfOh dancing with myselfOh dancing with myselfWell there's nothing to loseAnd there's nothing to proveI'll be dancing with myselfIf I looked all over the worldAnd there's every type of girlBut your empty eyesSeem to pass me byLeave me dancing with myselfSo let's sink another drink'Cause it'll give me time to thinkIf I had the chanceI'd ask the world to danceAnd I'll be dancing with myselfOh dancing with myselfOh dancing with myselfWell there's nothing to loseAnd there's nothing to proveI'll be dancing with myselfOh dancing with myselfOh dancing with myselfWell there's nothing to loseAnd there's nothing to proveI'll be dancing with myselfIf I looked all over the worldAnd there's every type of girlBut your empty eyesSeem to pass me byLeave me dancing with myselfSo let's sink another drink'Cause it'll give me time to thinkIf I had the chanceI'd ask the world to danceAnd I'll be dancing with myselfI'll be dancing with myselfSo let's sink another drink'Cause it'll give me time to thinkOh dancing with myselfOh dancing with myselfWell there's nothing to loseAnd there's nothing to proveI'll be dancing with myselfOh dancing with myselfOh dancing with myselfWell there's nothing to loseAnd there's nothing to proveI'll be dancing with myself
