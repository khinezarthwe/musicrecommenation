(Coverdale)I'm down on loveAn' I don't give a damn,I take my chancesWhenever I canLike a lamb to the slaughter,Another sacrifice,For giving love to womanWith a heart stone cold as iceI'm down on loveAn' I'm clean out of pain,I ain't no strangerTo the crying gameToo scared to suffer,An' too blind to see,But, I played with fireAn' I got what was coming to meNow, one more heartacheDon't bother me,Just one more lonely nightTo drown in miseryI am a victim of love,A victim of love,Lord, I never thoughtI'd be a victim of loveVictim of love, victim of love,Lord, I never thoughtI'd be a victim of loveI'm down on loveAn' I feel like a foolTo beg for mercy'Cos I broke the rulesSo do me no favoursWith your cool advice,I know the losing cost,An' I'll pay the priceOne more heartacheDon't bother meOne more lonely nightTo drown in miseryI am a victim of love,A victim of love,Lord, I never thoughtI'd be a victim of loveVictim of love,A victim of love,Lord, I never thoughtI'd be a victim of loveOne more heartacheDon't bother meOne more lonely nightTo drown in miseryVictim of love,A victim of love,Lord, I never thoughtI'd be a victim of love...
