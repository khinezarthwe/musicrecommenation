I need a gun to keep myself from harmThe poor people are burning in the sunBut they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chanceI need a gun 'cause all I do is dance'Cause all I do is danceI need a gun to keep myself from harmThe poor people are burning in the sunNo, they ain't got a chance, they ain't got a chanceI need a gun 'cause all I do is dance'Cause all I do is danceGet my backpack, I got my act rightIn case you act quite difficultAnd your result weaken with anger and discontentSome are seekin' "In search of" like NimoyI'm a peace-loving decoy ready for retaliationI change the whole location to a pine box six-underImpulsive, don't ask why or wonderOrders given to me is 'Strike' and I'm thunderWith lightning fast reflexes on constant alertFrom the constant hurt that seems limitlessWith no drop in pressureSeems like everybody's out to test ya'Til they see you breakThey can't conceal the hate that consumes youI'm the reason why you fill up your IsuzuChill with your old lady at the tiltI got a 90 days visit and I'm filled with guiltFrom things that I've seenYour water's from a bottle, mine's from a canteenAt night I hear the shots ring, so I'm a light sleeperThe cost of life, it seems to get cheaperOut in the desert with my street sweeperWith the flight suit onMaybe to him I'm just a pawnSo he can advanceRemember when we used to dance?Man, all I wanna do is danceDance, dance, danceI need a gun to keep myself from harm
