Tell me that you know another way to get it doneIt's not me or how I would beBut it's a different situationA different situationYou lay awake in the night just staring at the ceiling abovePulling pieces of it out is such a waste of timeYou keep on fighting to remember that nothing is lost in the endWhen you burn, burn, burn your life downGet me to the doorOut of bedOn the trackI'm not sureStarting overIt's a different situation, a different situationYou wake up in the night and refuse to be afraid of the nowUnfolding pieces of it faster, don't you waste your timeYou've been planning to remember this, so nothing will be lost in the endWhen you burn, burn, burn your life downWhen you burn, burn, burn your life downI drive around the block and I'm not looking to my rightI feel the glass against my cheek and I can't see you in the lightI break my heart around it, break my heart around itI drive around the block and I'm not looking to my rightI feel the glass against my cheek and I can't see you in the lightI break my heart around this, break my heart around this pole
