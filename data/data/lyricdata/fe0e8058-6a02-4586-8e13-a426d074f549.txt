Tell me that you know another way to get it done It's not me or how I would be But it's a different situation A different situation You lay awake in the night just staring at the ceiling above Pulling pieces of it out is such a waste of time You keep on fighting to remember that nothing is lost in the end When you burn, burn, burn your life down Get me to the door Out of bed On the track I'm not sure Starting over It's a different situation, a different situation You wake up in the night and refuse to be afraid of the now Unfolding pieces of it faster, don't you waste your time You've been planning to remember this, so nothing will be lost in the end When you burn, burn, burn your life down When you burn, burn, burn your life down I drive around the block and I'm not looking to my right I feel the glass against my cheek and I can't see you in the light I break my heart around it, break my heart around it I drive around the block and I'm not looking to my right I feel the glass against my cheek and I can't see you in the light I break my heart around this, break my heart around this pole
