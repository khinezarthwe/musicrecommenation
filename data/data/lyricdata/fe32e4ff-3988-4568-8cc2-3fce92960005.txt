Well, I tripped, I fell down naked Well, I scratched my knees, they bled Sew up my eyes, need no more In our game there is no score Forgive me, father, why should ya bother? Try honesty, try honesty Hop in your dump truck, reverse for good luck Ride over me, ride over me Take on the whole world, fight with the young girls Die, tragedy, die, tragedy Call me a cheapskate, come on, for Pete's sake Cry agony, cry agony I'm insane, it's your fault, so sly Your well of lies ran dry And I cut the cord, free fall From so high we seem so small Forgive me, father, why should ya bother? Try honesty, try honesty Hop in your dump truck, reverse for good luck Ride over me, ride over me Take on the whole world, fight with the young girls Die, tragedy, die, tragedy Call me a cheapskate, come on, for Pete's sake Cry agony, cry agony I'm insane, it's your fault Cry I'm insane, it's your fault Cry I'm insane, it's your fault Cry Forgive me, father, why should ya bother now? Forgive me, father, why should ya bother now? Forgive me, father, why should ya bother? Try honesty, try honesty Hop in your dump truck, reverse for good luck Ride over me, ride over me Take on the whole world, fight with the young girls Die, tragedy, die, tragedy Call me a cheapskate, come on, for Pete's sake Cry agony, cry agony Cry agony, cry agony Try honesty, try honesty Cry agony, cry agony
