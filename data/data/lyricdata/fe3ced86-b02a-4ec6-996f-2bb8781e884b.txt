First I learned to crawl and then some other strokes I can never remember any real good jokes Do you feel like swimming Do you feel like swimming Yes right now I know a way to swim all the way down town I know a way to swim all the way down town It's a lot like swimming first time over your head It gets easier when you move your arms and legs And for air you lift your head, why don't we try right now Yes right now Yes right now Well I know a way to swim all the way down town I know a way to swim all the way down town, well I know a way to swim all the way down town I know a way to swim all the way down town We'll go by way of the garden, fat with tomatoes and beans on the vine Sweet like the way it was Like swimming for the very first time Do you feel like swimming Do you feel like swimming Well
