The party's all right, I might wanna stop drinkingWhat were we talking about?My body won't tell my mind what I've been thinkingBefore it's out of my mouthThe minute I get upset, that's it, it's overI'm already out of the roomWhy can't I just forget that what I know's gonna hurt?There's not much else I can doI'm breaking my own rules, becoming someone elseWell everybody says I oughta get over myselfI'm thinking I can't moveIf there isn't somewhere else to goI've probably made mistakes that I've forgottenIt's all ambiguous nowI've been willing to take the shape of what you wantedI could just figure it outI'm breaking my own rules, becoming someone elseWell everybody says I oughta get over myselfI'm thinking I can't moveIf there isn't somewhere else to goI'm breaking my own rules, becoming someone elseWell everybody says I oughta get over myselfI'm thinking I can't moveIf there isn't somewhere else to go, whoa, whoaIt's changing my issues as far as I can tellBut everybody says I oughta get over myselfI'm thinking I can't loseIf there isn't somewhere else to go
