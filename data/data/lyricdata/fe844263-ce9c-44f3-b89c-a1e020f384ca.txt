Stay out super late tonightPicking apples, making piesPut a little something in our lemonadeAnd take it with usWe're half awake in a fake empireWe're half awake in a fake empireTiptoe through our shiny cityWith our diamond slippers onDo our gay ballet on iceBluebirds on our shouldersWe're half awake in a fake empireWe're half awake in a fake empireTurn the light out, say goodnightNo thinking for a little whileLet's not try to figure outEverything at onceIt's hard to keep track of youFalling through the skyWe're half awake in a fake empireWe're half awake in a fake empire
