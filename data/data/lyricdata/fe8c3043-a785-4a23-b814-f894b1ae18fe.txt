My love I am the speed of soundI left them motherless, fatherlessTheir souls dangling inside-out from their mouthsBut it's never enoughI want youCarved your name across three countiesGround it in with bloody hidesTheir broken necks will lie in the ditch'till you "Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop this madness!"I want youI have waited with a glacier's patienceSmashed every transformer with every trailer'till nothing was standing65 miles wideBut still you are nowhere, still you are nowhereNowhere in sightCome out to meet me, run out to meet meCome into the lightClimb the boxcars to the engineThrough the smoke and to the skyYour rails have always outrun mine so IPicked them up and crashed them downIn a moment close to now'cause I miss, I miss,I miss, I miss,I miss, I miss,I miss, I missHow you'd sigh yourself to sleepWhen I'd rake the springtime across your sheetsMy love I am the speed of soundI left them motherless, fatherlessTheir souls dangling inside-out from their mouthsBut it's never enoughMy love, I'm an owl on the sill in the eveningBut morning finds youStill warm and breathingThis tornado loves youThis tornado loves youThis tornado loves youThis tornado loves youThis tornado loves youWhat will make you believe me?This tornado loves youThis tornado loves youThis tornado loves youThis tornado loves youThis tornado loves youWhat will make you believe me?
