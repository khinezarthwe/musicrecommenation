Pleading with Athos of the RockIn the ancient language which he spokeBut I didn't even give a damn'Cause all I wanted to do was just sit back and talkTalk about the restless winds that were blowing in my mindThat twisted all we grow as too thinAnd feelings I had which I couldn't describeAnd the places I'd come withinAnd in the chrome light I stood up and I just beganI'd sell my pride on a whim, let it blowThe righteous light that was guiding me stillAnd the man with the Holy soulImpatience took a dim view of my wordsAnd let me down againI'm so dusty, ladenWith all that world-weary stars and reverendsI've got your Mother Mary, GodLife is emptyI wanna find some peace todayI said, Mother Mary, ohLife's so emptyI need some peace today, oh, todayOh, those twisted corridors of powerIn the ivory walls of hateWhere the eagle flies so proudlyAnd I just can't, just can't waitIn the victim's mind, he's readyHe is ready to exploit the weaknessOf the century's greed and feeblenessAnd the lies they whisper to his brothers and sistersPlease, JesusOh, I love youWon't you come and stay?Mother MaryI know life is emptyI wanna find some peace todayHannah hung around for the the rapture on the roam for forty yearsOf course no-one came and you know I still live in fearAlways waiting for the prince of seventy-twoI was waiting for the world to fall apart, how about you?If Husain could have waitedNava'i could have seen the stars in the sky'Cause I've been waiting for you for fifty odd yearsI've been waiting for you through these hopes and these tearsI was waiting for you, I'm a-waiting for youWhy, why, why did I let you down?Can I carry that cross for you?Can I carry that cross for you?Is there anything that I need to know?Did you let me down?Did you let me down?Why, why, whyDid you let me down?Did you think I wouldn't knowWhy, why, whyDid you let me down?I wanna sit right here, I'm gonna write you a letterI wanna sail, I wanna sail over the oceanI wanna talk to best and Muhammad AliI don't just use my fists, yeah, I use my feetThey got spiritI got spiritOh, mama, mama, mama, it's like yellow earthWhat was it like for you when you was giving birth?You got it in for you, I got it in for meI said, why you always jump in places like Stevie McQueen?I got spirit, come feel itI got spirit, you can feel itHe got spirit, we gotta feel itYou got spirit, scream if you feel itWake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake upWake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
