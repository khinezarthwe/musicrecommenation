On an' on, the road goes on,An' it'll go on forever,Time will show if you and IWill walk that road togetherThrough fire an' water, ice an' snow,Heaven above us, an' hell below,Holding on, trying to walk the lineWith sweet temptation running close behindI'm talking 'bout loveOoh, loveLike a fire forever burning,A flaming heart that's yearning, more an' moreA love to keep us warmOn the wings of the stormEveryday an' every nightI keep hoping it'll be all right,Trying to leave the past behind,Still looking for some peace of mindBut, destiny brought us togetherAn' promised us a time that would last foreverTho' it's all been said beforeIt's the kind of love worth fighting forI'm talking about loveOoh, loveLike a fire forever burning,A flaming heart that's yearning, more an' moreA love to keep you warmOn the wings of the stormOn an' on, the road goes on,An' it'll go on forever,Time will show if you and IWill walk that road togetherI'm talking about loveOoh, loveLike a fire forever burning,A flaming heart that's yearning, more an' moreA love to keep us warmOn the wings of the stormMy love will keep you warmOn the wings of the storm...
