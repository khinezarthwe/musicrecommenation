I was waiting for a cross-town train in the London UndergroundWhen it struck meThat I'd been waiting since birth to find a love that would look and soundLike a movieSo I changed my plans, I rented a camera and a vanAnd then I called youI need you to pretend that we are in love againAnd you agreed toI want so badly to believe that there is truthAnd love is realAnd I want life in every wordTo the extent that it's absurdI grease the lens and frame the shotUsing a friend as my stand-inThe script had called for rain, but it was clear that daySo we faked itThe marker snapped and I yelled, "Quiet on the set!"And then called, "Action!"I kissed you in a style Clark Gable would have admiredI thought it classicI want so badly to believe that there is truthThat love is realAnd I want life in every word to the extentThat it's absurdI know you're wise beyond your yearsBut do you ever get the fearThat your perfect verse is just a lieYou tell yourself to help you get byThat you tell yourself to help you get byThat you tell yourself to help you get by
