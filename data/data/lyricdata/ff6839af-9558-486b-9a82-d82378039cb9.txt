There's a place in the sun for anyoneWho has the willTo chase one and I think I've found mineYes, I do believe I have found mineSo, close your eyesAnd think of someone you physically admireAnd let me kiss you, ohLet me kiss you, ohI zig-zagged all over AmericaAnd I cannot find a safety havenSay, would you let me cry on your shoulderI've heard that you'll try anything twiceClose your eyesAnd think of someone you physically admireAnd let me kiss you, ohLet me kiss you, ohBut then you open your eyesAnd you see someone that you physically despiseBut my heart is openMy heart is open to you
