Keep your things in a place meant to hideBut I know they're there somewhere and I know that's where you'll go tonightI'll be thrown over just like beforeThe white lady loves you moreNeed a metal man just to pick up your feetIt's a long time since you cared enough for me to even be discreetI know what this metal is forThe white lady loves you moreI'm lookin' at a hand full of broken plansAnd I'm tired of playing it downYou just want her to do anything to youThere ain't nothin' that you won't allowYou wake up in the middle of the nightFrom a dream you won't remember flashing on like a cop's lightYou say she's waiting and I know what forThe white lady loves you moreThe white lady
