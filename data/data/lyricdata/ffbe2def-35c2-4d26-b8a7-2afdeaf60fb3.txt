I waited till I saw the sunI don't know why I didn't comeI left you by the house of funI don't know why I didn't comeI don't know why I didn't comeWhen I saw the break of dayI wished that I could fly awayInstead of kneeling in the sandCatching teardrops in my handMy heart is drenched in wineBut you'll be on my mind foreverOut across the endless seaI will die in ecstasyBut I'll be a bag of bonesDriving down the road aloneMy heart is drenched in wineBut you'll be on my mind foreverSomething has to make you runI don't know why I didn't comeI feel as empty as a drumI don't know why I didn't comeI don't know why I didn't comeI don't know why I didn't come
