Come you masters of war, you that build all the gunsYou that build the death place, you that build all the gunsYou that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desksI just want you to know, I can see through your masksYou that never done nothing, but to build and destroyYou play with my world, like it's your little toyYou put a gun in my hand, then you hide from my eyesAnd you turn and run farther as the fast bullets flyLike Judas of old, you lie and deceiveA world war can be won, and you want me to believeBut I see through your eyes, and I see through your brainLike I see through the water that runs down my drainYou that fasten all the triggers, for the others to fireThen you sit back and watch, while the death count gets higherYou hide in your mansion, while young people's bloodFlows out of their bodies and is buried in the mudYou've thrown the worst fear, that could ever be hurledThe fear to bring children, into this worldFor threatenin' my baby, unborn and unnamedYou ain't worth the blood that runs in your veinsHow much do I know, to talk out of turn?You might say that I'm young, you might say I'm unlearnedBut there's one thing I know, though I'm younger than youEven Jesus would never forgive what you doLet me ask you one question, is your money that good?Will it buy you forgiveness? do you think that it could?Oh, I think you will find, when your death takes its tollAll the money you made will never buy back your soulAnd I hope that you die, and your death will come soonI'll follow your casket, in the pale afternoonAnd I'll watch as you're lowered, into your deathbedAnd I'll stand on your grave 'til I'm sure that you're dead
